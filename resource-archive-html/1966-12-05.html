the  16th  November, 1966, on behalf  of  the  House  I

received  from  a  delegation of the Commons  House  of

Northern Ireland a gift of a bookcase and books. I have

Leader of the House, I have in the course of allocating

seats  to  the three hon. Members who took their  oaths

today  taken  the  opportunity to reallocate  seats  to

<br><br>2.39 p.m.



<div align="center"><b>ADVERTISEMENT ON FOUNTAIN AT AIRPORT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister why a firm has been allowed to incorporate  an

advertisement in the fountain at the approach to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



the  Paya Lebar International Airport; whether the firm

pays  a concession fee for the advertisement, and  what

is the fee for a year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the decision to allow

the  firm concerned to incorporate an advertisement  in

the  fountain  built and paid for by the company  at  a

cost  of $69,000 at the approach road to the Paya Lebar

International  Airport was approved  by  the  Malaysian

Ministry  of Transport on the 5th July, 1965, when  the

Department of Civil Aviation was under its control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company does not pay concession fees for the

advertisement,  but it is responsible  for  the  proper

operation and maintenance of the fountain, estimated to

cost  $5,000  a  year,  in  addition  to  the  cost  of

electricity  and  water consumed. At the  end  of  five

years, from 1st January, 1966, the fountain and all its

fittings will become the property of the Government. As

advertising  on  the  fountain has  drawn  unfavourable

comments  from  visitors to the  Airport,  negotiations

will  be  taken  up  to transfer the  fountain  to  the

Government within the contract period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, can I raise a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to

ask the Minister concerned, since this is a place which

many  tourists will be visiting, whether  we  can  take

immediate  steps  to  remove  this  advertisement  and,

instead, other advertisements, posters, or slogans of a

national nature be posted there. For instance,  we  can

publicise that we want to build a multi-racial society,

or  that we welcome all international tourists to  come

to Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, as I have pointed out

just  now,  there is a contract by which the  Singapore

Government has to abide. And as I have indicated to the

House,   we  are  now  negotiating  with  the   company

concerned  to  transfer the fountain to the  Government

within five years as soon as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



possible,  and until we do so we are not in a  position

to  control  any  advertising  slogans  which  are  now

located  on  the fountain itself. However, I  am  quite

certain  that the company, being a longstanding company

in  Singapore, will co-operate with the Government, and

I am certain that there will be no difficulties when we

come  to  negotiate with them by which such a  transfer

can be made to the Government.

<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL ENTRY OF PERSONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INTO SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Sim Boon Woo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  he  is  aware that there are  people  entering

Singapore  illegally along the coast of Mata  Ikan  and

Padang  Terbakar,  and what action  he  has  taken,  or

proposes to take, in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, as long as there was

a  curfew imposed in Singapore port waters, it was easy

to  detect any craft making its way to Singapore.  With

the  ending of Indonesian confrontation, the curfew has

now  been  lifted  and, as is to be expected,  numerous

small  craft  make  their way  to  Singapore  from  the

neighbouring  Rhio Islands. Some of  these  are  barter

traders who conduct their business at Telok Ayer Basin,

while  others  conceivably bring in illegal  immigrants

who land at odd spots along the Singa-port coast line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department itself does not have a

preventive  branch to check these illegal entries,  but

relies on the Ministry of the Interior and Defence  for

surveillance  of  our coastal waters.  The  Immigration

Department  is  liaising  with  the  Ministry  of   the

Interior and Defence on how to improve marine and beach

patrols. Immigration and security responsibilities will

be   integrated  when  the  Immigration  Department  is

transferred to the Ministry of the Interior and Defence

from  the  1st  of  January next year.  More  effective

measures to control illegal entries can then be  worked

out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Vigilante Corps in those areas

close  to  the  sea  can  perform  a  public  duty   by

patrolling the beaches as they did previously, and help

to  detain  illegal  entries. From time  to  time,  the

presence  of  illegal immigrants has been  reported  by

public-spirited citizens to the Immigration Department.

Raids are conducted and illegal immigrants are deported

after  serving a term of imprisonment according to  the

law.

<div align="center"><b>STUDENT DEMONSTRATION OUTSIDE CITY HALL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister of Defence,

in  the  demonstration by Ngee Ann College students  in

front of the City Hall on 4th November, 1966, how  many

Police officers and how many students were injured, and

how  many  students were treated for their injuries  at

the General Hospital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, in all, 13

Police  officers were injured. One of these,  a  police

constable, was warded at the General Hospital for  four

days  with  a 2-inch laceration on his right  forehead.

Subsequently,  12 days' medical leave  were  prescribed

for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six students were injured and were treated as

outpatients  at the General Hospital. The most  serious

injury among them appeared to be a fractured heel  bone

and  this, on the admission of the student himself, was

caused  when he jumped from the City Hall steps to  the

ground in order to avoid the Police.

<div align="center"><b>FROM 1ST JANUARY, 1966</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister of Defence how

many  cases  of gang-fights have been reported  to  the

Police  since the beginning of 1966, and  how  many  of

them took place in bars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, since the beginning of 1966, three  gang-fights have been reported to the Police, of which  none

took place in bars.

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRE AT 7 M.S. HOLLAND ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b> asked the Minister of Defence

whether he is aware that the Prime Minister promised to

build  a  community centre at the 7 m.s.  Holland  Road

when  he  toured  the Ulu Pandan Constituency  on  13th

February, 1966, and when the centre will be built.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister is not in the habit of

making  promises  during his tours  of  constituencies.

What  was discussed in Ulu Pandan on the 13th February,

1966,  was  a  proposal  to  establish  a  rural   type

community  centre  near  Yoon Kin  Road,  off  7½  m.s.

Holland  Road. This was found to be unsuitable  because

of  the  scarcity  of  population. The  Prime  Minister

advised  the Ulu Pandan Citizens Consultative Committee

to  look for an alternative site. He said that if  this

site  is found suitable, the People's Association would

give  consideration  to  the proposal  to  establish  a

community centre there. The suitability of this site is

being  investigated  by  the People's  Association.  My

preliminary  impression is that this locality  is  also

too  sparsely populated, there being only 200  families

within  a radius of two miles of the site. The Citizens

Consultative Committee has claimed that there  are  500

families.  If  this site is not suitable, the  People's

Association will assist in finding another site in  the

Constituency.

<div align="center"><b>SECOND LANGUAGE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr S. Rajoo</b> asked the Minister for Education, in

the implementation of the policy of compulsory study of

a  second language in all secondary schools as from the

beginning of 1966, whether (a) teaching facilities  for

second  languages  are provided in all  Government  and

Government-aided  secondary schools (including  Mission

schools), and language teachers are available  for  all

the four languages in all the schools, irrespective  of

the  number  of students wishing to take  a  particular

language; and (b) all Government-aided secondary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



schools (including Mission schools) have been made

to  implement  the policy and commence  Tamil  language

classes, where formerly there were none.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, facilities for

teaching any of the four official languages as a second

language are provided in all Government and Government-aided  schools, including Mission schools. Where second

language  teachers  cannot be  fully  deployed  in  one

school,  they  teach in a group of schools.  Where  the

number  of  pupils choosing a second language  is  very

small,  classes  are conducted centrally  both  in  the

afternoon for morning school pupils and in the  morning

for  afternoon  school  pupils. It  is  stressed  that,

irrespective of the number of students wishing to  take

a  particular  second language, adequate provision  has

been   made.  All  schools  have  been  instructed   to

implement the policy of a compulsory second language in

Secondary I from 1966 and provision has been  made  for

Tamil.  This  year there are 9 morning and 8  afternoon

secondary   Tamil  class  centres,  with  17  full-time

teachers  to teach about 2,500 Tamil pupils.  There  is

also  one  English secondary school with two  part-time

Tamil  language teachers, one for the morning  and  one

for  the  afternoon, and two other schools  have  Tamil

language  teachers teaching the language during  school

hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> A supplementary question,

Sir. I understand that Tamil classes are centrally  run

at  various places, due to the small number of children

taking  Tamil  as a second language. But  my  point  in

bringing  up this question here is that each and  every

school,  whether  it is a Government or  a  Government-aided  school  or  a mission school,  should  be  self-

sufficient  with language teachers in  all  streams  of

language, and not depend on any special centres  to  be

provided by Government. I feel that the special centres -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could the Member frame the supplementary

question  rather  than  make a criticism  of  what  the

Minister has said?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> My supplementary question is this. In

spite  of the centres run by the Government for various

languages, will the Minister give an assurance that all

schools  -  whether they are Government or  Government-aided or Mission schools - will be made self-sufficient

with language teachers to teach the respective language

in  the  school itself, irrespective of the  number  of

children taking a second language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, wherever there

is  a  sufficient  number  of pupils  taking  a  second

language, a full-time second language teacher  will  be

provided. But if the number of students taking a second

language in a particular school is small, for instance,

two  pupils, surely the Member for Farrer Park does not

expect  the  Government to provide a  full-time  second

language teacher for just two pupils?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for in, stance, in an

English school where there are Chinese, Malay and Tamil

children -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajoo, I am afraid I must pull you

up again. Could you frame the supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Yes. The supplementary question is this.

In  schools  where  second language  classes  are  run,

during the language period certain children will attend

either  the Chinese or Malay language classes,  whereas

the  Tamil  children  in these  schools  will  be  left

without  any  teacher, because although classrooms  are

available, there is no teacher to teach Tamil. That  is

what  I  understand. Will the Minister  look  into  the

matter  and  investigate where such a state of  affairs

exists,   so  that  Tamil-language  teachers  will   be

provided and the Tamil children do not waste their time

idling during this language period?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, I will certainly

investigate if specific instances can be pointed out to

me.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In view of the number of questions we

have today - it is already five to 3 p.m. - I hope Members

that those who have questions low down in the list will

have their questions answered orally. Mr Rodrigues.

<div align="center"><b>SUPERVISION OF KINDERGARTENS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Education,  in  view  of the opportunity  that  can  be

afforded to anti-national elements to poison the  minds

supervision of kindergartens or consider bringing  them

within the state educational system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most

another   by   the  Government  or  a  quasi-Government

organisation.    These   are   private    kindergartens

registered  with  the  Ministry  of  Education,   those

organised  and supervised by the People's  Association,

and  creches and play centres organised and  supervised

by   the   Department  of  Social  Welfare.  Owing   to

Government supervision of one kind or another, it would

be  extremely difficult for anti-national  elements  to

poison  the minds of young children unnoticed. To  date

there  has  been no report of such incidents  in  these

kindergartens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for quite some time now, the demand for

places in kindergartens for pre-school age children has

been very great. This results in the establishment of a

large  number of unregistered kindergartens which  fall

into   three  categories:  (1)  those  run  by  private

individuals catering for the upper and middle  classes,

mainly  in  the private residential estates; (2)  those

run by religious organisations in Housing Board Estates

or  near squatter areas in the City area; (3) those run

by political parties, particularly by the anti-national

Barisan Sosialis. These kindergartens do not come under

the  supervision of the Government and are,  therefore,

open  to  exploitation  by the anti-national  elements,

particularly so in the case of those run by the Barisan

Sosialis  in  the rural areas. Besides the  opportunity

afforded them to poison the minds of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



the  young children in their kindergarten classes,  the

teachers  of these classes and their helpers,  who  are

mostly  members  of  the Barisan Sosialis,  very  often

exploit the opportunity of meeting the parents of these

children  and  putting  across  their  insidious  anti-national  propaganda. Furthermore,  these  kindergarten

classes also provide a source of income to sustain  the

livelihood  of  the Barisan Sosialis members.  However,

the Government does not favour the negative approach in

dealing  with  this  problem by closing  down  all  the

kindergartens run by the anti-national elements. To  do

so would fall into the trap of the Barisan Sosialis who

are   bound  to  exploit  the  issue  by  accusing  the

Government  of being unsympathetic towards the  welfare

of  the children of the poor living particularly in the

rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a real demand for pre-school education by

Singapore  parents  in  recent years  as  a  result  of

improvement in the standard of living and the awareness

of  the value of an early education for children.  This

is,  therefore, a social problem which should be better

dealt  with in a more positive manner. Since 1964,  the

Government   has,  through  the  People's  Association,

established  kindergarten  classes  in  the   community

centres to meet the needs of the rural parents  and  to

counter  the influence of kindergarten classes  run  by

the  anti-national  elements. By  May  this  year,  the

People's  Association have established 159 kindergarten

classes  with  a total enrolment of 5,900  pupils.  The

number  of classes has since increased to 349  and  the

total  enrolment to 12,500, whereas both the number  of

classes run by the anti-national elements and the total

enrolment  have  drastically dwindled.  Furthermore,  a

great  majority  of the kindergarten age  children  for

classes  next year have been registered by the People's

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is desirable that all kindergartens should

be  supervised  by the Government and be brought  under

the   Republic   educational  system,   the   cost   of

implementing  this  by  way of  capital  and  recurrent

expenditure is, however, prohibitive. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



Government,  therefore, does not envisage bringing  the

kindergartens  within the State educational  system  in

the foreseeable future.

positive  encouragement  regarding  the  use  of  local

products,  and in line with the policy a directive  was

given  on the 14th of December, 1965, to all Government

departments  and  statutory  bodies  by  the   Economic

Development Division of the Ministry of Finance on  the

subject    of   preferential   purchase   of    locally

manufactured products. To implement such  a  policy  of

giving  preference  to  locally-manufactured  goods,  a

preferential price margin of up to 5 per  cent  of  the

tendered  price  of an equivalent imported  product  is

generally  allowed. In certain instances, such  as  the

bulk  purchase  of medicines and drugs, the  preference

price margin might even be higher.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can we have the first part first?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> All right. First, Mr Speaker, is the

tablets  from  a  local  factory  at  $4.38  cents  per

after  deducting  the sales cost, is  $4.45  cents  per

thousand tablets?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> As far as I can remember, the

going to have very heavy manufacturing costs, I do  not

think Government is expected to bear the burden.  As  I

have said earlier,

there is already a margin of up to 5 per cent, and,  in

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I am afraid I have no answer to

<div align="center"><b>MOSQUITO CONTROL AND ERADICATION IN ANSON</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Health

what  progress  has  been  made  in  the  control   and

eradication of mosquitoes in the Anson Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for Health)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to

inform  the Member for Anson that so far no steps  have

been taken to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



eradicate  mosquitoes  in Anson Constituency.  This  is

because  it  is not possible to deal with the  mosquito

problem of Singapore on a piecemeal basis, as are shown

in the results of a field survey without house-to-house

checks  done  on the 24th of November, 1966,  in  Anson

Constituency itself. The results are no less  than  107

breeding  places, mainly due to mosquitoes breeding  in

water-bearing  receptacles  found  in  scrap  dumps  of

second-hand   dealers,   water   storage    tanks    in

unauthorised dwellings, stagnant water in drains caused

by  refuse  thrown into them by hawkers  and  residents

over a very long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of second-hand goods dealers in this area are

responsible  for  the dumping of discarded  receptacles

which  in  turn become breeding places for  mosquitoes.

This  is  a  long-time process and it is  difficult  to

eradicate the mosquito menace within a short time.  The

view  of  my  Ministry is that the mosquito eradication

scheme can only be effective when it goes hand in  hand

with  the proper reorganisation of the Public Cleansing

Service which, I believe Members will agree with me, is

to  be  launched shortly, as well as the licensing  and

control  of hawkers, which campaign has already  begun.

As  we  all  know,  Mr Speaker, the  control  and  the

registration  of such hawkers constitute a  very  major

part  of  the  Ministry  of Health  and  this  work  is

progressing satisfactorily.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, a supplementary question on the answer  given.

I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether

he  can  implement  the scheme as  early  as  possible,

because  this  is  the time when the  rainy  season  is

around  the corner and flooding is coming very soon.  I

myself have been subjected to the mosquito menace.  The

breeding of mosquitoes is increasing, and I would  like

the  Minister  to  implement the  scheme  as  early  as

possible so that the people of Singapore will  be  free

from the mosquito menace.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

supplementary question raised requires me to implement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



the  scheme as early as possible. That, of course, will

depend on our resources. We certainly wish to implement

our  scheme  as  early as possible. As I  have  already

indicated  earlier, for certain reasons and because  of

restrictions,  we  must  do some  preparatory  work  in

advance  before we can do anything else.  The  mosquito

menace  is a big problem arising out of various  causes

and we must have an overall scheme before we can start.

A  lot  of  preparation has to be made, and the  moment

this  is  done, we shall launch a campaign to implement

the scheme. Whether this can be implemented as early as

possible  will,  of course, depend on the  question  of

staff and other resources.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

supplementary question. I remember at the  last  Budget

session  the Minister concerned replied to my  question

on  this  mosquito  menace. He  did  mention  that  his

Ministry  was  going  to set up an Anti-Mosquito  Unit.

Sir,  after a lapse of almost 12 months, I am wondering

whether this Unit has, in fact, been set up and whether

work  has  been carried out to eradicate  the  mosquito

menace.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  question of an Anti-Mosquito Unit was first raised

by  the  Ministry  of  Health and this  Unit  has  been

established. But because of the shortage of staff,  the

work  of this Unit cannot be launched on a large scale.

As  I have already said, the Public Health Division  of

the Ministry of Health is now preparing various schemes

and  is  in liaison with the various sections. So  when

all this preparatory work is done, a proper scheme will

be launched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question about the Anti-Mosquito Unit is

that,  at  the  present moment, this Unit  has  already

carried  out  work in various areas in Singapore  on  a

regional basis. It is not possible to do the work on an

extensive basis because of the reasons I have given. So

I  would  like to appeal to Members in this  House,  as

they  are very concerned with the mosquito menace, that

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



best  thing for them to do at the present moment is  to

start a cleansing campaign in their own constituencies,

or    an   anti-mosquito   campaign   in   their    own

constituencies. That is more effective at  the  present

moment.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Another

supplementary  question, Mr Speaker. From  the  answer

given  by the Parliamentary Secretary, I would like  to

ask him a further question on this point. If his scheme

cannot  be implemented within a year, then do not  tell

me  that  the  people of Singapore have to be  tolerant

about  mosquito bites for some more time. I  appeal  to

him,  as he has already indicated that this problem  is

actually dependent on the question of staff. Because of

the  shortage of staff, he says he cannot carry out his

work  as  scheduled. I would like to ask  the  Minister

whether  he is prepared to consider employing temporary

staff  to eradicate the mosquito menace, because if  it

gets out of hand, then there will be epidemics all over

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, this

question  of  the mosquito menace is getting  more  and

more interesting. But it is a question which requires a

long  time to solve. I can assure Members that  at  the

present  moment  it is not just the question  of  staff

that  is  bothering us. As one can read from the  local

newspapers,  the  labour  problem  is  coming  to   the

forefront because of the Federation of Unions having  a

desire  to  negotiate with the Ministry of Health.  The

question  is not just one of staff but is also  one  of

industrial   relations.  Furthermore,  there   is   the

technical aspect of the problem. Some people simply  do

not care much about the situation. They just dump their

empty  tins  around. So the first step now is  for  the

Members  concerned to start their own campaigns  within

their  own constituencies - the campaigns to  clean  up

their  own  constituencies  and  to  get  rid  of   the

mosquitoes.  In serious cases, I think,  if  notice  is

given, I believe the Ministry of Health will take steps

to have some kind of regional control of the problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

what  we  want  to  know is whether  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  is  going  to  take  steps  to  destroy  the

mosquitoes. But what kind of answers is he  giving?  We

want to know what steps he is taking, but he is talking

about  labour problems and other things.  All  that  we

want  to  know is whether he is taking steps,  and  how

long it will take him to control this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  we  can do anything, we must have the necessary

staff.  Without the workers, how can we  do  our  work?

This is fundamental. That is why my answer involves the

question  of  industrial  relations  and  some   labour

unions.  Some unions within the Ministry of Health  may

want  to  take  strike action. To put everything  in  a

nutshell,  in answer to the question of the Member  for

Anson  as  to whether we want to eradicate the mosquito

menace, of course, the answer is, "Yes, we want to  get

rid of mosquitoes."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

stand  to  be  corrected if I am  wrong.  I  heard  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health  say

that  he  has difficulty in recruiting labour force  to

eradicate the mosquito menace. I think he should  refer

this matter to the Ministry of Labour. I am sure he can

get  thousands  of  workers to eradicate  the  mosquito

menace. Why does he not take this step?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if

it  is  a question of recruitment, then I believe  that

every  Member  here  is  quite  clear  about  it.  Each

Ministry has to work within its vote for the purpose of

recruiting  staff.  If we have no such  vote,  then  we

cannot  do  anything even if we can get help  from  the

Ministry of Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

view of the tremendous mosquito menace, may I know  how

many cases of malaria have been reported last year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on

this  question, I have no statistics at the moment.  If

the

Member for Joo Chiat is interested, he can give written

notice and I shall endeavour to give him a reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Just now the Parliamentary Secretary

has  said  that  there is a shortage of  funds  in  his

Ministry.  But I have been informed that  there  is  an

excess  of funds of over a million dollars.  I  do  not

know whether that is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  not  familiar with the figures and I will  have  to

Member concerned is still interested, he can give me  a

written  question and I shall try to answer it  at  the

next sitting.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If there are any Members who want to

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  he  will consider the addition  of  a  "Mobile

Unit",  for  providing Resuscitation  Service,  to  the

present  ambulance fleet of the Kandang Kerbau Hospital

to give a good and safe Maternity Service and when.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, a Mobile Unit to provide a resuscitation

service  for the Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital  was

seriously  considered towards the end of 1959  but  was

found not necessary for the following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, Singapore being a small island and Kandang

Kerbau  Hospital not more than 15 miles away  from  any

given   point,   and  what  with  the  excellent   road

facilities  throughout  the  island,  access   to   the

hospital is rapid and easy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, the proportion of women delivering in the

hospital  is almost 75 per cent of the total deliveries

in Singapore. This being the case, it is estimated that

at  the  most  about four cases per year of  those  who

deliver  outside the Kandang Kerbau Hospital  may  need

the  type of service envisaged for the Mobile  Unit  if

set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, the resources of Kandang Kerbau Hospital

itself  are  limited. It will be preferable to  entrain

staff  for normal hospital work which itself is already

severely strained rather than set aside valuable  staff

just to stand by for occasional calls. To man a 24-hour

service, the Mobile Unit will require three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



teams working in shifts - not to mention those who will

have  to  cover  for leave when the  staff  take  their

annual  leave  or  emergency leave. The  minimum  staff

required  to  establish one Mobile Unit  would  be  two

medical  officers, five nurses, four ambulance  drivers

and four attendants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

how many first-class and second-class bar licences were

issued  during the period 1st January to 20th November,

1966,  and  how many first-class and second-class  bars

were there in Singapore on 20th November, 1966.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> From the 1st of January to 20th of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



November,  1966, 30 first-class public  house  licences

and two second-class public house licences were issued.

There  are 294 first-class public house and 59  second-class public house licences now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> A supplementary question, Sir. In

view  of  the  high figure of first-class bar  licences

issued  by  the Government, will the Minister  consider

imposing a moratorium on the issue of bar licences,  as

I have been informed that young bar waitresses, who are

engaged  to sit with the customers, also take on  other

assignments?  In view of my information, this  practice

will  bring  about a very adverse moral effect  on  our

young  population. So I would like to ask the  Minister

to  consider my request to impose a moratorium  on  the

issue of bar licences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not had the

pleasure  of pub-crawling. So I am not able to  confirm

whether  what  the hon. Member says is  true.  But  our

policy here is to allow freedom to people to trade.  If

there is any danger of moral turpitude, I think we will

tackle it in some other way, rather than by restriction

of bar licences.

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Safeguards)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether  he  is aware that in the past 9  months  there

were  about 6,000 accidents in industries of  which  10

cases  were  fatal, 63 cases resulted in workers  being

maimed for life and 627 cases resulted in workers being

temporarily  incapacitated; and if  he  will  say  what

steps  have  been,  or  are being,  taken  to  minimise

industrial accidents in order to safeguard the lives of

workers and the livelihood of their families.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first

nine months of this year the Labour Ministry received a

total of 6,383 reports of accidents. Of these, 83  were

fatal, 435 resulted in permanent disablement, and 5,865

resulted in temporary disablement. Fifty-seven  of  the

fatal accidents were accounted for by heart failure  (9

cases),  drowning  (9  cases), explosions  (13  cases),

falls of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



persons (14 cases), and collisions (12 cases).  Of  the

435   permanent  disablement  cases,  the   degree   of

disablement in more than half of them - 297 cases - was

from  1¼ per cent to 5 per cent. In another 107  cases,

it was from 6 per cent to 20 per cent. In the remaining

31 cases, disablement was about 21 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations into the causes of accidents in

factories have revealed that most of them were  due  to

faulty  operation of machinery, ignorance  or  lack  of

training  of the workmen, lack of coordination  between

workers,  carelessness  or negligence  of  the  workers

concerned,   absence  of  safety  devices   or   safety

appliances,   and   poor  maintenance   of   industrial

equipment.  Minimum standards of safety and  health  in

factories  are  laid  down in the  Factories  Ordinance

which  is enforced by my Ministry. During the last  ten

months,  factory inspectors made 6,246  inspections  of

factories.  It has been found that enforcement  of  the

law  alone  is  not  sufficient for the  prevention  of

accidents.  It is necessary to educate the workers,  to

arouse  their safety consciousness, and also to improve

supervision of work by management. In order to do this,

a  number  of measures have been taken. Safety  posters

have  been  printed and distributed  to  factories  for

prominent  display,  and safety pamphlets  are  in  the

course   of  preparation.  The  managements  of  bigger

factories   have  been  persuaded  to  set  up   safety

committees  in  their factories to promote  the  safety

consciousness of their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An industrial Safety Branch has been established

under the National Safety First Council with the aim of

preventing accidents in industrial establishments. More

regular  visits to factories by inspectors of factories

are  being  planned  so that advice  can  be  given  to

factory  occupiers and a higher standard of safety  can

be  achieved.  Arrangements have  been  made  with  the

Electricity  Department of the Public  Utilities  Board

since   September   this  year   for   the   electrical

installations   in  factories  to   be   inspected   by

electrical inspectors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to take preventive measures in respect of

occupational health in industry, it is intended to  set

up   an  Industrial  Health  Unit.  For  this  purpose,

assistance  has  been sought under  the  U.N.  Expanded

Programme  of  Technical Assistance for  an  industrial

health  expert. An expert is due to arrive  here  early

next  year.  The Industrial Health Unit, when  set  up,

will contribute greatly to the prevention of industrial

hazards to which workmen are exposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  supplementary question. The Minister  has  mentioned

just now that a unit will be formed to look into and to

prevent  accidents in industries. I would like  to  ask

whether his Ministry has regularly sent out officers to

inspect the various factories and installations in  the

factories. He has also said just now that some  of  the

accidents  were  due  to  faulty  machinery.  I   would

therefore  like to ask whether there will  be  adequate

compensation  to  those  workers  who  met  with   such

accidents. These accidents are disastrous because  they

bring about more widows and orphans. So I would ask the

Minister to take appropriate steps to prevent them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The Member for Sembawang did not

hear me just now. He has asked whether we have sent out

any inspectors to inspect these factories regularly.  I

have  said that during the last 10 months we have  sent

inspectors to these factories for inspection and  6,246

inspections have been made during this period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister has said that he has sent out  inspectors

to inspect the various factories.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> May I speak in Mandarin, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): These inspections

were  made  not  after  the accidents  but  before  the

accidents.  We  sent  them  out  before  the  accidents

happened. They were routine inspections.

<div align="center"><b>GIFT FROM HOUSE OF COMMONS</b></div>



<br><br>3.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its warm appreciation of the

generous gift of a bookcase and books which it received

on the 16th of November, 1966, from a delegation of the

Commons  House of Parliament of the United  Kingdom  of

Great  Britain  and  Northern Ireland  as  a  token  of

friendship  and goodwill on the part of  the  House  of

Commons  and  people of the United Kingdom towards  the

Parliament  and people of Singapore to commemorate  the

attainment  by  Singapore  of independence  within  the

Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Members of the House will recollect that

last month a delegation representing both sides of  the

House  of Commons paid us a visit and at the same  time

presented  us  with  a  bookcase  with  some  books  on

Parliament  and  Constitutional Law to  the  C.P.A. in

commemoration of Singapore's attaining independence. We

had  the opportunity to discuss many matters with  them

on  that occasion, and I have no doubt that as a result

of  our  discussions,  they  left  Singapore  with  the

conviction that this Government is determined to  carry

on    the    practice   of   parliamentary   democracy,

notwithstanding the fact that today we see  Members  of

the People's Action Party alone occupying seats on both

sides  of this Chamber. This is not our fault;  neither

is  it  our intention to destroy the Opposition, but  I

must  certainly say that the Opposition in its  madness

has  destroyed  itself.  There  is  no  clause  in  the

Constitution  of Singapore which forbids  or  prohibits

the  formation of other political Parties.  Neither  is

there   any  law  which  prevents  representatives   of

political  Parties, or Independents  for  that  matter,

from  contesting the General Elections or, as the  case

may be in the recent bye-elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If today the House sees only a one-Party

representation,  it  has been  at  the  behest  of  the

people. It is ultimately the electorate, the people  of

Singapore, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



decide   whether   they  wish  to  maintain   political

stability,  whether they wish that there should  be  an

efficient,  honest and stable government,  to  run  the

affairs  of State and, therefore, determine the  future

of our two million population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these words, Mr Speaker, I will only reiterate

that  the  hopes  and  wishes of  all  those  who  wish

parliamentary  democracy to be upheld will  not  be  in

vain,  and  it  is our intention to continue  a  custom

which  we  have had for the last decade. You  yourself,

Mr Speaker, have expressed on behalf of the House your

appreciation of the gift and the goodwill  visit  which

was  paid by Members of the House of Commons, and I  do

not wish to add further to what you already have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its warm appreciation of the

generous gift of a bookcase and books which it received

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the House approves the financial policy of the

Government for the year 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am privileged to present the

Second  Budget of the Independent Republic of Singapore

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first full year of our independence, 1966, has

been   a   period  of  intense  effort  and   activity.

Separation of Singapore from Malaysia did not mean  the

loss  of  the common market but the loss of expectation

of a common market. Our manufacturers have now overcome

this  psychological  barrier.  Industrial  output   and

employment    increased    substantially.    We    have

consolidated  and strengthened our financial  position.

The   uncertainty   following   separation   has   been

dispelled. Our official external reserves are up.



<br><br><i>ECONOMIC REVIEW AND TRENDS</i>



<br><br><i>Growth of Gross Domestic Product</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy continues to move forward. Gross domestic

product  in  1965 increased by $206 million  to  $3,017

million, representing a rate of growth of 7.3 per  cent

over 1964. This compares very favourably with 1964 when

the  rate  of  growth was only 2 per  cent.  Even  more

gratifying  is  the  fact  that  in  spite  of   sudden

political developments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



in  the  last  six years, Singapore has  been  able  to

achieve a consistently high rate of growth. The average

annual  rate  of  increase in  gross  domestic  product

during the period 1960 to 1965 is 8.5 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of great importance to the economy is the rate of

gross   capital   formation. In  1965  gross   capital

formation increased by $49.1 million to $463.8 million,

reflecting an increase of 11.8 per cent over 1964.  It,

therefore, accounts for about 15 per cent of the  gross

domestic  product. Though creditable, this  performance

falls short of the 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent rate of

capital accumulation, which is considered necessary for

self-sustaining growth in developing countries.



<br><br><i>External Reserves</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official external reserves of the Government and

statutory   authorities  have  increased   by   $123.3

million  this  year,  compared with  the  position  in 1965.

Official  reserves now  total  $1,038  million,

compared  with $914.7 million in September last  year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is made up as follows:-

<pre>

                                              1966        1965



                   Government reserves      554.31       484.7

                   Statutory authorities    183.69       153.6

                                            783.00       638.3



                   Add estimate of          300.00       276.4

                   currency reserves

                                          --------       -----

                               Total      1,038.00       914.7

                                          ========       =====

</pre>



<br><br>Our official reserves would probably be more, depending

on  the  amount of currency redeemed in Singapore  next

year.  External  debts  stand at only  $61.75  million,

which  is a slight increase of $2.75 million over  last

year.



<br><br><i>Rising External Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buoyancy of the economy is reflected by the

rising  volume  of external trade. In  the  first  nine

months  of  this year, imports were valued at  $3,017.9

million, which is an increase of 6.3 per cent over  the

same  period  in 1965. Similarly, exports  expanded  to

$2,494.6  million, an increase of 13.3  per  cent  over

last year. Total external trade by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



the  third quarter of this year has therefore shown  an

increase  of  9.36 per cent. Projected  over  the  full

year,  total  trade  may  well exceed  $7,200  million.

Though this would be still below the peak years of 1962

and  1963, prospects for improvement are good,  bearing

in  mind  the  resumption of trade with  Indonesia  and

establishment  of  direct trading  relations  with  the

Soviet Union and East European countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An examination of the composition of Singapore's

growing external trade shows even more significant  and

encouraging   trends.   Domestic   exports,   excluding

petroleum products in 1965, increased by $48.9  million

to  $345.8 million. This represents an increase of 16.4

per  cent  over 1964. It forms 11.5 per cent  of  total

exports  compared  to 10.7 per cent in  1964.  A  large

proportion  of  the increase in domestic exports  comes

from  local industries. For instance, exports of  wheat

flour  in 1965 showed an increase of 125 per cent  over

1964.  Similarly,  exports of steel  bars  and  plywood

recorded  increases of 140 per cent and  197  per  cent

respectively over the previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imports of goods purely for re-export is declining in

importance. In 1964 re-exports of goods imported formed

37.9 per cent of total exports. In 1965 it fell to 36.2

per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural that with industrialisation, Singapore

will  either  process  goods  it  imports  before   re-exporting  them, or use them as raw materials  for  the

manufacture  of new products, which are then  exported.

Retained  imports  will  therefore  increase  with  the

years.  In  1965 retained imports increased  by  $190.5

million  to $1,809 million. But what is significant  is

the  fact that an increasing amount of imports retained

is  in  the  form  of either raw materials  or  capital

equipment required by new industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing volume of external trade has resulted in

higher  earnings for Singapore also. In  1965  earnings

from  trade was estimated at $396.2 million,  or  $44.5

million  over earnings in 1964, which stood  at  $351.7

million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Building and Construction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of buildings commenced in the first six

months  of this year stood at $56.5 million as  against

$80.7  million  for the same period last year.  Private

development  fell  from  $42 million  in  1965  to  $28

million  in  1966  for the same period - a  fall  of  $14

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment in property is less attractive than

investment in other fields. I will outline later on the

steps  we  are taking to make investments in properties

in   urban  and  designated  areas  a  more  attractive

proposition.



<br><br><i>Transportation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial growth and expanding trade is shown by the

increasing volume of shipping and cargo handled through

our  port. The number and tonnage of ships entering and

leaving  the  port of Singapore in 1965  surpassed  all

previous  records with an impressive figure  of  21,862

vessels  of 90 million net registered tons. Performance

this year is likely to be even higher as there has been

a rapid increase in shipping movements during the first

nine months of the year. Cargo passing through the port

last year totalled 21.3 million tons, or an increase of

18.2  per  cent over 1964. Performance this year  shows

that  cargo handled will reach 24 million tons in 1966.

Increase in cargo handled is due to Singapore's growing

importance   as   a  centre  for  petroleum   refining.

Discharge  of  industrial raw materials  such  as  bulk

wheat  and  cement  clinker  is  also  rising  rapidly,

testimony to Singapore's changing industrial structure.



<br><br><i>Finance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well being of an economy can also be tested by an

examination of its financial bedrock, namely,  deposits

in the banks and advances made by them during the year.

As  at  the  end  of September this year,  deposits  of

customers  other than banks totalled $1,337.2  million.

This is $115.2 million more than the amount of deposits

at  the  end  of December 1965 and $172.9 million  more

than  deposits held at the end of September last  year.

Increases  in  bank  deposits this year  are  therefore

better than increases in previous years, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



averaged $82.3 million annually between 1961 and  1965.

Loans  and advances of banks show the level of economic

activity generated. At the end of September this  year,

loans  and advances to customers other than banks total

$995  million, or an increase of $81 million  over  the

amount lent at the end of December 1965.



<br><br><i>Control of Finance Companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, the activities of certain finance companies

have  given  rise to some concern, and I  feel  that  a

public  warning  would be timely. Very simply,  finance

companies  receive deposits from the public on  payment

of  interest and re-lend this money to finance, usually

on  hire-purchase, the sale of goods  like  motor-cars,

motor-scooters, radios, refrigerators and so on.  In  a

sense  they operate like a bank, but unlike  banks  the

activities  of  finance companies are not  governed  by

law.  Recently,  there  has been  a  spate  of  finance

companies  advertising  for deposits  from  the  public

offering  to  pay  rather high rates  of  interest.  It

follows  that in turn these finance companies must  re-lend  at even higher rates of interest in order to make

a profit. To do so, some of them may be tempted to take

undue  risks in their lending and thereby endanger  the

security  of the deposits made by the public. There  is

nothing  wrong  if a reputable finance company  accepts

deposits from the public and in turn re-lends  if  care

is taken to ensure that the purpose for which the money

is  re-lent  is  sound and there is reasonable  credit-worthiness to warrant such lending. It is only when the

finance   companies   become   reckless   and    accept

unjustifiable  risks  without  regard  to  proper   and

adequate securities, that the monies deposited  by  the

public are exposed to danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will shortly introduce legislation to

regulate   and  control  the  operations   of   finance

companies  in order to safeguard the interests  of  the

public who deposit funds with them.



<br><br><i>Industrial Expansion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrial census of 1965 shows that output by

manufacturing industries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



increased  by  16.6  per cent from  $927.9  million  to

$1,082.1  million. Employment in these industries  rose

by  13.8 per cent from 41,488 to 47,217. Value added in

1965  was  $319.6 million compared with $282.5 million,

or a rise of 13.1 per cent. Wages also rose accordingly

from $111 million in 1964 to $132 million in 1965. This

is  an  increase  of  18.9 per cent.  The  increase  in

output,  value added, employment and wages is due  both

to  establishment of new industries, as well as  rising

production of firms already established. Output  of  an

established group of 882 manufacturing firms  increased

from  $918.9 million to $1,034.6 million, or  12.6  per

cent in 1965 over 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation remains the backbone of our

economic  development. During the two years in Malaysia

no  Pioneer Certificates were issued in Singapore,  but

since   August  last  year  we  have  issued   58   new

certificates;  in addition, some 25 more projects  were

approved  in  principle. Today, there are  165  pioneer

industrial  firms compared with 113  in  1964.  107  of

these  are already in production while 33 projects  are

in various stages of implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September 1966, the total investment of these

pioneer  firms in fixed assets had grown to  more  than

$300 million from $255 million at the end of 1965.  The

total  value  of output of these firms is  expected  to

reach  $450 million this year, as against $318  million

in  1965.  In terms of employment, the total number  of

workers  in pioneer firms has grown from 5,000  at  the

end  of 1964 to 12,000 today. For the industrial sector

as  a  whole, the production of all industrial firms  -

pioneer and non-pioneer - in the Republic has risen  by

nearly 20 per cent during the past 12 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of the industrial

development  programme is that our exports of  domestic

products  have  been  increasing  steadily.  As   noted

earlier,  in  1965,  $345.8 million worth  of  domestic

products were exported. This is expected to reach  some

$450  million this year. Another significant aspect  of

our programme is that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



have succeeded in broadening our industrial base. There

is   today  a  wide  range  of  industrial  enterprises

scattered  all over the Republic which are  capable  of

expansion.   This   includes  the  expansion   of   oil

refineries into a petro-chemical complex, the expansion

of  general ship-repairing and building facilities  for

construction of specialised vessels, construction of  a

fisheries  harbour  as part of an integrated  plan  for

developing a deep-sea fishing and canning industry, the

production of parts and components for motor  vehicles,

electronics  and other engineering assembly industries,

the development of an integrated feedmill and vegetable

oil  complex  around  the grain  silo  enterprise,  the

expansion  of  caustic soda and chlorine production  to

p.v.c. and  other  chemicals, the establishment  of  a

modern paper mill for supporting various paper products

industries, the expansion of garments manufacturing  to

integrated  textile  mills,  and  the  development   of

integrated  timber projects to make use of  waste  from

saw-milling and plywood factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide the infrastructure for expansion,

continuing efforts are being directed to developing new

industrial  land  and factory buildings.  Prepared  new

land  for industry at the Jurong Industrial Estate  has

gone  up  to  2,843 acres in September  this  year,  as

compared with some 2,443 acres at the end of 1965.  The

country's   first  flatted  factory  at  Tanglin   Halt

Industrial  Estate was fully occupied immediately  upon

completion. More will be built. Prepared sites  in  the

Kallang Park Marine Industry Zone and the Kranji Timber

Industry Estate are also in great demand.



<br><br><i>NEW FISCAL INCENTIVES</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the economy in 1965 and the current

year shows that it is moving forward. By all criteria -

external trade, domestic exports, industrial production

and  savings - Singapore has an expanding economy.  The

challenge  really is whether the Singapore economy  can

grow  fast  enough  to  solve its fundamental  problem,

namely, generation of employment opportunities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period 1961-1965, employment opportunities

increased by 57,600 jobs, or an average of 11,520  jobs

a  year. This fell short of the 70,000 additional  jobs

needed.  This  shortfall of 12,400 jobs, added  to  the

number of people already unemployed at the beginning of

1961, raised the number of unemployed to 56,300 at  the

end of 1965. This level of unemployment constitutes  10

per  cent  of the total economically active population.

The incidence of unemployment is therefore high. Unless

we  can  during  the  coming  five  years  reduce  this

spectre,  then all the economic gains will be  lost  in

the  turmoil of social and political unrest.  Over  the

next five years from 1966 to 1970, Singapore would need

not  only  to  wipe  off the backlog  of  the  existing

unemployed,  but also provide another 95,000  jobs  for

our  youths,  who would be leaving schools and  seeking

entry into the labour market.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to this employment problem lies in a

crash   programme  for  the  development   of   export-orientated industries. As in the case of all  countries

which  strive  for  industrial  development,  we   have

initially only a limited number of industries  directed

entirely  towards exports. The majority of our existing

industries  still  depend to  a  great  extent  on  the

domestic market. This is inevitable in the early stages

of  our industrial development. We must now move  to  a

new  phase  of  the industrial programme,  namely,  the

development of export-orientated industries.  In  order

to  achieve  early full employment and to ensure  long-term  economic stability and growth, we need  specially

to  encourage  manufacturers with established  overseas

markets and which can draw their raw material supply on

a world-wide basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After independence, we began to work in this

direction.  I  am  glad  to report  that  we  have  now

completed the necessary administrative arrangements for

such  a crash programme. This programme calls for three

major areas of action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Development Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the development of human resources remains

our  most  valuable asset. It is only in  recent  years

that  we  began to gear our educational system  towards

providing  skills needed for an industrial society.  In

order to achieve rapid technological advancement and to

develop  to  the  full  the potential  quality  of  our

workers,  it  will  be necessary  to  organise  a  mass

programme of training within industries for specialised

skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board has already started,

on  a  limited  scale, the training of technicians  and

skilled workers in tool and die-making, electro-plating

and heat treatment. The specialised training programmes

help  to  upgrade  the  skill of  our  workers  in  the

existing  industries and, what is  more  important,  to

impart  new specialised skills and knowledge to  school

leavers  to prepare them for new and more sophisticated

industries.  A  Metal Industry Development  Centre  and

Prototype  Production and Training Centre for machinery

building, electronics, precision instruments,  printing

and  plastic  will  be set up. These  centres  will  be

operated  in  close  co-operation  with  industry.   In

addition,   specialised  production  teams,   including

workers, will be sent overseas for on-the-job training.

Each  of  such  schemes  will be directed  towards  the

creation of specific factories. By building up a  large

reservoir  of technicians and skilled workers,  and  by

gearing training to the industrial promotion programme,

we can quickly enter into a more sophisticated stage of

industrial development.



<br><br><i>National Productivity Drive</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of action lies in re-doubling our

efforts  towards  high  quality  and  lower  production

costs.  This  is  because the international  market  is

becoming  increasingly  competitive.  Young  industries

take  time  to  mature and yet meet fierce  competition

from the start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the co-operation of the National Trades Union

Congress, the Singapore Manufacturers' Association  and

the Singapore Employers' Federation, we jointly drew up

in 1965 a Charter for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



Industrial  Progress. It is recognised by  all  parties

that  high productivity brings better wages and working

conditions, lower prices for consumers at home,  and  a

wider  market abroad and, finally, adequate  investment

returns, continuing expansion of production capacities,

and  full  employment. To translate this  basic  policy

into   concrete  action,  practical  steps  have   been

initiated. The Singapore Productivity Centre,  under  a

Governing  Council with representation of  all  parties

concerned,  will come into operation in  January  1967.

The Centre will be entrusted with the responsibility of

launching  a  national  movement  directed  to  further

labour-management  co-operation,  and  to  improve  the

operational  efficiency  of  every  enterprise  in  the

Republic.



<br><br><i>Export and Investment Incentives</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the third area of action. Clearly, the

success  of our development training programme and  the

national productivity drive depends ultimately  on  the

continuing  expansion  of our  exports  and  the  rapid

growth  of  our  industrial  sector.  To  achieve  both

objectives in the shortest possible time, we need  many

more  entrepreneurs, much more managerial  capabilities

and  technical  knowledge,  and  especially  much  more

international  marketing "know-how". We have  therefore

to attract the types of export industries which buy raw

materials and sell their products on a world-wide basis

and  which can make full use of the high quality of our

labour  force, our geographic advantages, and efficient

infrastructures.  International manufacturers  of  this

type  have more or less free choice in selecting  their

plant  location. Singapore, therefore, has  to  compete

with other countries in all parts of the world for such

enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that our fiscal incentives must be as

attractive as, if not more than, those offered by other

countries.  To all industries, pioneer or  non-pioneer,

which are prepared to play an active role in our export-orientated   programme   and   to   make   a   positive

contribution  to  this  new  phase  of  our  industrial

development,  the  Government will grant,  with  effect

from  1st  January, 1967, the necessary incentives  for

export and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



investment,  for  expansion as well as for  encouraging

rapid   technological  advancement.  This   means   the

incentives will apply to export profits earned in 1967,

and  will generally be taken into account for the  year

of assessment 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, for export and investment, the

Government   will   grant  approved   enterprises   the

following incentives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First: Tax on interest earned by non-residents from

deposits held in an external account in a bank  in

Singapore will be reduced from 40 per cent  to  10

per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second: Interest paid from Singapore sources and

received  by  persons or enterprises  overseas  is

generally   liable  to  tax  in  Singapore.   Such

payments  made  on  approved  loans  advanced   to

approved enterprises in Singapore for the purchase

of  capital equipment from abroad will be exempted

from tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third: Profit on export of manufactured goods for

both existing and new manufacturing industries and

deep-sea fisheries, but excluding processing, will

be  taxed  at the equivalent of one-tenth  of  the

normal company tax rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concessionary rate (4 per cent) applies to all

limited   liability  companies  where   the   profits

derived  from  export are at least  20  per  cent  of

their   total  profits,  and  export  sales  (f.o.b.)

amount   to   not  less  than  $100,000   per   year.

Qualifying firms with pioneer status will be  granted

this  concessionary  rate for a period  of  not  less

than  10  years  from  the date of  expiry  of  their

pioneer   status.   The  concessionary   period   for

qualifying  non-pioneer firms will be not  less  than  15 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern industries cannot afford to stand still. They

must  be encouraged to expand their productive capacity

in  order  to  achieve  high volume  and  low  cost  of

production,  thus enabling them to compete successfully

in the international market. For existing industries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



which  expand, the Government will offer the  following

incentives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of plant expansion through the increase

of  funds  by  an  approved enterprise,  it  will  be

granted  tax  exemption, from the date on  which  the

newly  added equipment thereof starts to  operate  or

to   render  services,  in  respect  of  the   income

increased as a result of such expansion, on  a  basis

similar  to  that  applicable to pioneer  industries,

provided that at the time of closing of accounts  for

the  year the expansion has resulted in a 30 per cent

or  more increase in its productive capacity over the

appropriate  existing capacity  applicable  prior  to

such plant expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated by the Government that the

development  of  many  modern sophisticated  industries

such  as  petro-chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics

and  specialised  branches  of  engineering  industries

incur  high initial investments in research  and  pilot

plants  or  in specially designed tools and  equipment,

which  become obsolete in a comparatively short period.

In   order  to  seek  continuing  advancement  of   the

technological level of our industries and to  speed  up

the  process of development, the Government  will  give

the following encouragement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax on royalties, licences and technical assistance

fees,  and  approved  contributions  to  develop  and

research   costs   payable   overseas   by   approved

enterprises  may be reduced from 40 per  cent  to  20

per  cent,  provided that such concession  would  not

result  in  transfer  of any  tax  liability  to  the

resident  countries of the recipients.  Further,  the

Government may exempt such payments in special  cases

if  the  national  interest would be thereby  served.

Foreign  recipients  who derive  royalties,  licences

and  technical  assistance fees  from  Singapore  and

convert   such   payments   into   equity   of    the

manufacturing  firms operating in  Singapore  may  be

exempted from tax liability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Existing Incentives</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these new incentives, we have already

provided for powers whereby the Government may  approve

on application special accelerated initial depreciation

up  to 100 per cent in one year and a three-year write-off  for plant, equipment or machinery utilised in  the

manufacture  or  processing  of  goods  and  materials.

Besides,  approved manufacturers are now also  entitled

to double deduction on expenditure spent on advertising

or  market development. Investors will, of course, also

continue   to   enjoy  the  benefits  of  pioneer   tax

exemption.



<br><br><i>Urban Redevelopment Incentives</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are no doubt aware of our

programme  to  renew and redevelop our city  and  urban

areas.  Clearance and demolition of the 135-acre Outram

and   90-acre   Crawford  precincts   are   progressing

satisfactorily. Part of these areas will be marked  out

for  development  by  the private  sector  and  private

investors may also redevelop other city areas on  their

own.  Such  development must, however, be  sufficiently

comprehensive  to  make full use of  the  land  and  to

provide  for  better  traffic  circulation,  pedestrian

bays,  parking  and  other  facilities.  In  order   to

stimulate private participation in redevelopment of the

city, the Government has decided that with effect  from

next  year,  the  rate of property tax  for  properties

erected  in  areas  designated for urban  redevelopment

will  be 12 per cent as against the present rate of  36

per   cent.   In   addition,  during  the   period   of

construction, there will be a waiver of property tax on

the  land for an initial period of six months, plus  an

additional month for every storey of the building to be

erected  on  the  property. For  example,  a  10-storey

building will receive a waiver of 16 months of property

tax  on the vacant property while construction is going

on.  Singapore has over the last six years  achieved  a

unique  position  in the provision of low-cost  housing

and  it is hoped that the Government's plans for  urban

renewal  with private participation will achieve  equal

success.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Development Outlook</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For private industry to respond fully to the new

fiscal  incentives, it will be necessary for the entire

Government  machinery to have a forward and enlightened

outlook.  The  administration  must  be  infused   with

enthusiasm   for   development  and  be   intelligently

flexible to facilitate it. Experience in many countries

shows  that  unnecessary  rigidity,  officiousness  and

delays  will  nullify  the effects  of  incentives  and

frustrate promotional efforts. What we want are results

- not red tape. We are giving high priority to a review

and    examination   of   existing    Ordinances    and

administrative  rules  for  their  relevance   to   the

development  effort.  We must  ensure  that  those  who

respond  receive full co-operation and support  at  all

levels and sectors of the Government complex.



<br><br><i>General Review of Revenue and Expenditure in 1966</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to a review of revenue and expenditure in

1966.  It  was estimated that the budget for 1966  will

yield  a  small balance of approximately half a million

dollars.  The  objective was a balanced budget  without

having  to  run down reserves. I am pleased  to  report

that  from  performance  up to  now,  the  position  is

expected   to   be  slightly  better  than   originally

estimated and it is likely that we shall close the year

with a balance of about $5.7 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue receipts for the year are likely to come out

at  $537.3  million. A sum of $401.3 million  has  been

collected by the end of September. The balance of  $136

million is expected to be collected in the last quarter

of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure up to the end of September came to $354.5

million, including a sum of $23.3 million paid  to  the

International Monetary Fund and a sum of $1 million  to

the    World   Bank,   being   Singapore's   membership

subscription to these two world bodies. Expenditure for

the last three months of the year is estimated at about

$177.1   million  inclusive  of  a  transfer   to   the

Development Fund of $30 million. Total expenditure  for

the year should then come out at $531.6 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a total revenue of $537.3 million and a total

expenditure of $531.6 million, the surplus will  amount

to  $5.7  million;  in other words,  about  $5  million

better than anticipated.



<br><br><i>Revenue 1966</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue for 1966 is as estimated, with short-falls from some heads compensated by increases in

others.  Revenue  from customs duties  on  liquor  will

probably be $0.8 million less than anticipated, due  to

a fall in consumption of imported malt liquors. Revenue

from  imported petroleum products will be $25.5 million

less  than estimated, but this will be more than offset

by  an  increase  in  revenue from petroleum  products,

locally  refined,  amounting to $33.2 million.  Revenue

from sugar is expected to be $3.1 million less, because

of duty exemptions to manufacturers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax collections will probably exceed the

estimate by $12 million, due in part to natural  growth

and   in   part   to   more  efficient  administration.

Television  does  not seem to have  adversely  affected

other forms of entertainment, as entertainment duty  is

likely  to  bring in $2.1 million more than  estimated.

Excise  duty  on  liquors  is expected  to  exceed  the

estimate  by $3.8 million, due to increased consumption

of  locally  brewed liquor. Receipts from tobacco  duty

are  likely to yield $2.7 million more, due to  greater

use   of   dutiable  raw  tobacco  in  local  cigarette

manufacture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motor Vehicle Ad Valorem Registration Fees and Road

Tax are expected to exceed the estimate by $1.6 million

and  $0.6  million respectively. Receipts from property

tax  in  the city area are expected to come up  to  the

estimate, but receipts from the rural area are expected

to  be  $2.5  million  more, reflecting  the  trend  of

greater development there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other important increases are sales of Goods and

Services from current operations, which is likely to be

$0.9 million more, and an increase of $1.9 million from

interest on the Republic's investments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of lesser import duties were re-appraised

during the course of the year. They were found to be of

no   value   or   unnecessary   in   protecting   local

manufacturers  and  have been abolished.  These  duties

related  to  certain  categories  of  spa  and  aerated

waters, non-aerated beverages, non-alcoholic beverages,

and  compounds  of alcoholic preparations.  Import  and

excise  duties  on certain types of lubricating  grease

have  also  been removed. This is in keeping  with  our

policy not to hinder trade, where possible.



<br><br><i>Expenditure 1966</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the year, supplementary estimates

totalling $7.8 million were approved as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) $6.3 million for the Telecoms Department;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) $1.45 million for the Ministry of Labour; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) $43,000 for the Trade Division.



<br><br>Supplementary  estimates of $610,000 are  being  sought

for  the  Head of Expenditure "Public Works Recurrent",

making  total  supplementary estimates of $8.4  million

for  the year. Provision for this Head was found to  be

inadequate, i.e. "Public Works Recurrent". This was  on

account  of  the  large number of Government  buildings

which  had to be renovated during the year. During  the

period  under Malaysia, practically no maintenance  was

carried   out  on  the  buildings  which  were  Federal

responsibilities. This resulted in a larger than normal

number  of  buildings requiring urgent maintenance  and

repairs. The other Heads of Expenditure are expected to

keep within the provisions voted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the addition of supplementary estimates of $8.4

million, total estimated expenditure for the year would

now  be  $545 million. However, in view of  savings  in

certain departments, actual expenditure for the year is

expected  to be in the region of $531.6 million,  which

is  $5  million  less than the sum  of  $536.6  million

provided in the Estimates.



<br><br><i>Review of Development Expenditure in 1966</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for development expenditure for 1966, the public

sector development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



comprises  projects undertaken directly  by  Government

ministries and departments as well as schemes which are

implemented  by the various statutory authorities.  The

tentative public sector allocation for 1966 was  $430.5

million, made up of $149.6 million proposed expenditure

by  Government ministries and departments,  and  $280.9

million  to  be  spent  by  the statutory  authorities.

Allocation  for Government ministries was  subsequently

increased by a supplementary estimate of $27.2 million,

to  make  a  total of $176.8 million. Based  on  actual

performance  up  to date this year, it is  likely  that

public sector expenditure for the full year will  reach

$284  million.  Compared  with  actual  expenditure  of

$250.6 million in 1965, this represents an increase  of

13.3 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure by Government ministries will amount to

$113  million as compared with $67.2 million  spent  in

1965, reflecting an increase of 68.2 per cent. However,

nearly  $20  million  of  1966 expenditure  arose  from

payments for the SEACOM project as well as purchase  of

the  assets  of Cable & Wireless Ltd. Land  reclamation

and   urban   re-development  have  also  shown   rapid

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure by the statutory authorities is estimated

to  amount to $171 million, which is about 6.6 per cent

less than the $183.1 million spent in 1965. The fall in

expenditure  here is due mainly to a reduction  in  the

expenditure of the Economic Development Board,  largely

because  the major portion of the costly infrastructure

development  has  been completed.  Expenditure  by  the

other authorities was about 10 per cent higher in  1966

compared to 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sectoral development is likely to be: economic

development   $191  million;  social  development   $79

million; public administration and defence $14 million.



<br><br><i>Ordinary Estimates 1967</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial outlook for 1967 continues to be fair.

Total  revenue is estimated at $590.5 million and total

expenditure at $590.2 million, including a transfer  of

$30 million to the Development Fund. This gives a small

surplus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



of  $0.3  million. The estimated expenditure of  $590.2

million  for  1967  is higher than the  sum  of  $531.6

million  expected  to  be  spent  this  year  by  $58.6

million.  Fortunately, this increase is  matched  by  a

corresponding rise in estimated revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated revenue of $590.5 million is $53.2

million  higher  than  the revenue  of  $537.3  million

expected  to be collected for 1966. Thus, in  spite  of

the rather steep rise in expenditure, it is possible to

have a balanced budget for next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest increase in estimated expenditure is, as

always,  in  respect of the Ministry of Education.  For

1967,  expenditure for Education is estimated at $143.7

million,  which is $14.5 million more than the  sum  of

$129.2  million provided for this year. The main reason

for  the  increase  is because of  the  expenditure  on

secondary schools. This is required to accommodate  the

large number of students taken into the primary schools

during  the past few years and who would now move  into

secondary level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next highest rise is in respect of servicing the

Public Debt. This is a statutory expenditure and  shows

an  increase  of $11.2 million. With more  loans  being

floated with the years to finance development, the rise

in this expenditure is expected to continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal expansion of our Police and Defence Forces

results  in  a  rise  of estimated expenditure  of  the

Ministry  of the Interior and Defence by $4.9  million.

The  establishment of missions abroad in  keeping  with

our  new independent status is expected to result in  a

rise of $1.4 million in the expenditure of the Ministry

of  Foreign  Affairs. In addition, a  provision  of  $5

million has been included under the Ministry of Finance

head  of  expenditure  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring

property  abroad  for our foreign  missions,  and  $1.0

million   under   the  Contributions   and   Charitable

Allowances  head  of expenditure for  contributions  to

international organisations. For reasons which  I  have

mentioned, the estimates for the Telecoms Department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



for  1967 show an increase of $6 million, This increase

was covered by supplementary estimates in 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates for the Postal Department show a rise

of $2.2 million. Of this, $1.5 million is on account of

a  change  in  book-keeping  procedure  to  conform  to

Financial Regulations in respect of the mail conveyance

vote. Hitherto, receipts were credited to revenue  only

after  deduction of expenditure. This has been  changed

to paying in gross receipts and meeting the expenditure

involved  from an expenditure vote. The net  result  is

the  same  as  both  revenue and  expenditure  will  be

increased  by  the  same amount. The  balance  of  $0.7

million  of  estimated increase in the  expenditure  of

this Department is due mainly to the separation of  the

Postal Department from the Malaysian Postal Department.

As  a  result of the separation, the Postal  Department

will  have to set up new sections to deal with  certain

functions previously discharged by the headquarters  at

Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of expenditure "Public Works Recurrent"

shows  an increase of $1.4 million. This is mainly  due

to  the increase in the number of roads which leads  to

an  increase in expenditure on their maintenance and on

public street lighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases I have mentioned make up a total of

$47.6 million. The balance of $6 million is made up  of

small  increases of the other heads of  expenditure  on

account  of  normal expansion, such  as  about  half  a

million  dollar increase for the Hospital Division  and

$400,000 for Parks and Recreation.



<br><br><i>Revenue 1967</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from most of the major taxes are expected to

increase next year in the normal manner, resulting in a

total collection of $590.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income Tax is expected to yield $114.0 million.

Excise  and Entertainment Duties are expected to  yield

$73.6 million. The major increases under this group are

from  Entertainment Duty, liquors and petroleum. Excise

duties from petroleum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



products,  locally refined, will yield  aim  additional

$34.0  million  but, as against this, it  is  estimated

that  there  will be a fall from revenue on  duties  of

imported  petroleum  products of about  $24.8  million.

This  reflects the effect of our industrial policy  and

shows that with three refineries operating in Singapore

we   are  now  depending  less  and  less  on  imported

petroleum products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal increases are expected in tobacco duties,

property tax and other revenue items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving licence fees are being increased from $5 to $10 per annum, and this item is expected to bring in an additional $1.8 million. During the course of the year a review has been made of miscellaneous licence fees and fees for services

which have remained unchanged for periods varying  from

10  to  30  years,  and this is expected  to  yield  an

additional $2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable & Wireless Ltd, was acquired by Government in

1966   and  the  revenue  from  the  telecommunications

(External)  Service, and this new item  of  revenue  is

expected to yield $8.9 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's share of Currency Profits will amount to

$12 million.



<br><br><i>New Basis for Road Tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licence fees on motor vehicles have hitherto been

collected  on  the horsepower rating of  the  vehicles.

This is an obsolete method of taxing motor vehicles for

use  on  roads.  It is now proposed to change  this  to

follow  international  practice  by  prescribing   fees

according to the cubic centimeter cylinder capacity  of

the  vehicle.  The new Road Tax will be  10  cents  per

cubic  centimeter. The revised fee is expected to yield

an  increase of $5.5 million. Care, however, has  been

taken  to  minimise the incidence of  the  tax  on  the

public  transport sector. This is done by reducing  the

seating fee of $5 per passenger per month to $3.50  for

licensed  taxis  and $4.20 for buses. Therefore,  there

should be no increase in bus or taxi fares.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking these and the normal increases in other

revenue  items, it is anticipated that the 1967 revenue

figure will amount to $590.5 million.



<br><br><i>1967 Public Sector Development Programme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector development programme for 1967 will

amount to $411 million. The distribution between the

Government sector and the statutory authorities will be

$151.3 million and $259.7 million respectively. The

allocation by the various ministries and statutory

authorities is as follows:

</pre>



<br><br><i>Deputy Prime Minister's Office</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation for the D.P.M's Ministry will be $12.7

million. A large claim on the provision will be for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



telecommunications development. It  accounts  for  $5.7

million  of  the total. The major project here  is  the

installation  of  the  Automatic  Telephone   Switching

Exchange which will be in operation before the  end  of

1967.  This  will  not only bring in more  revenue  for

Singapore, but will also maintain our position  as  the

premier  international telephone  switching  centre  in

this  part  of the world. The Telex services  for  both

domestic  and international communications continue  to

grow. With the completion of the SEACOM cable next year

and  the growth of commercial and industrial activities

in  Singapore,  the  volume of  traffic  on  the  telex

services is expected to rise substantially in 1967. For

this reason $600,000 has been provided in the Estimates

for  the purchase of more subscribers' teleprinter 12.7

machines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other projects of the Telecommunications

Department are designed to expand radio services and to

develop trunks and junctions to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for telecommunications services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Aviation Department is expected to carry

out a number of projects to improve airport facilities.

$6  million has been provided for 1967. For the  safety

of  aircraft  operation the runway will be  re-surfaced

next  year.  The Instrument Landing System  and  Visual

Approach  Slope Indicators will be installed to  assist

pilots bringing aircraft in to land especially at night

and  during bad weather. The parking aprons and  hangar

facilities  will  be  expanded to cope  with  the

growth of international airline traffic to Singapore. A

start  will also be made to extend the  runway  by

1,000 feet to 10,000 feet.



<br><br><i>Ministry of the Interior and Defence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government's policy of requiring newly

recruited  civil servants to undergo military  training

is  implemented as from next year, it will be necessary

to  increase the number of training depots and training

camps. Some of the battalion camps of our regular units

are  in bad shape and will need to be rebuilt. Vehicles

available to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



the  regular  battalions as well  as  to  the  People's

Defence Force are at present grossly inadequate. It  is

necessary  to  acquire  more vehicles  as  well  as  to

provide  for  a  centre for maintenance and  repair  of

vehicles. A capital expenditure of $12 million for 1967

has  therefore been provided for the expansion  of  the

People's Defence Force and the Police.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.50p.m.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will have a budget of $26.5

million next year. This is 68 per cent higher than  the

1966   expenditure  of  $15.8  million.  Of  the  total

provision,  $22.5  million  will  be  for  the   School

Building  Programme. 1967 will see  the  completion  of

Government's  programme of expansion of primary  school

building  and emphasis will shift to secondary schools.

Thereafter, primary schools will be built only in newly

developed housing estates such as Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the need for skilled workers and technicians

for  industry, Government will build two new vocational

institutes  -  one  in  Jurong  for  the  teaching   of

engineering  trades  and the other  at  Queenstown  for

manual  and  applied  arts.  The  Singapore  Vocational

Institute  at Balestier Road will also be  extended  to

increase its intake of students. A sum of $580,000  has

been provided for the expansion of vocational education

in 1967.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health will spend $4.1 million on its

development  projects  in 1967;  this  is  a  threefold

increase over the expenditure of $1.5 million in  1966.

The  main project is the establishment of the institute

of  Medical Specialities and the Radio Therapy  Isotope

Centre  -  a  joint project between the  University  of

Singapore and the Ministry of Health. Structural  works

on the proposed 9-storey building will begin next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disposal of city refuse is becoming an acute

problem.  The  Kolam Ayer dumping ground is  no  longer

available for refuse disposal as it is now part of  the

Kallang  Basin Reclamation Scheme. Of the 600  tons  of

refuse collected in Singapore every day, over 500  tons

are  from  the City alone. There is an urgent  need  to

divert  city  refuse  to the rural  dumping  ground  at

Tampines.  To  do  this,  more  garbage  and  ancillary

vehicles  will be required. A provision of $800,000  is

being  made for the purchase of these vehicles. In  the

meanwhile, detailed planning is under way to  construct

an  incinerator at Redhill for the disposal of part  of

the city refuse.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Finance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total allocation to the Ministry of Finance is

$100.6  million.  Of  this sum, $85 million  represents

loans  to  the  Public  Utilities Board,  the  Economic

Development  Board  and  the  Housing  and  Development

Board.  Of  the balance, $10 million is  to  set  up  a

Contingency  Fund  for  development  purposes  and   $3

million will be a loan to the Government Officers'  Co-operative  Housing Society. The remaining $2.6  million

will  be spent on the expansion of the Customs Service.

The  projects envisaged in 1967 will contribute to  the

improvement   of   facilities  for  the   control   and

prevention of smuggling.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Culture and Social Affairs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation to the Ministry of Culture and Social

Affairs  for 1967 is $4.3 million, which is  less  than

its expenditure of $7.6 million in 1966. This is mainly

because  the  major  portion of  television  and  radio

facilities  has been provided in 1966 or earlier.  Only

minor  expenditure will be incurred in the Broadcasting

Division in 1967 for the completion of projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For parks and recreation facilities, 10 children's

playgrounds and 2 public parks will be built  in  1967,

while  the  Changi  beach resort will  continue  to  be

developed at a cost of $100,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new branch library will be constructed at Queenstown

next year to meet the demand for more library



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



facilities.  The  National  Library  now  has  a  total

readership of 106,300, which is more than it  can  cope

with. The Library in Queenstown will be the first of  a

series of branch libraries to cater for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Junior Approved School will be built in 1967 to

house and rehabilitate delinquent boys under the age of

16. To cope with the rapid growth of Jurong New Town, a

fire station will be constructed there.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Law and National Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total provision for the Ministry of Law and

National Development will be $88.8 million next year as

compared  to the expenditure of $55.3 million  in  1966 -

a  61  per cent increase. This Ministry has the highest

share  of  the 1967 Development Estimates and  accounts

for  more  than  50  per cent of the  total  Government

development expenditure for 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special projects undertaken by the Housing and

Development  Board acting as agents of the  Government,

namely, the East Coast and Kallang Reclamation Schemes,

Urban  Redevelopment  and Resettlement  will  cost  $38

million in 1967. These are continuing schemes initiated

even  before  1966. They have a long gestation  period.

The  benefits and services which the schemes will bring

will  only be fully realised in 5 to 10 years, or  even

15   years,   particularly  in  the   case   of   urban

redevelopment.  However, they are bold and  imaginative

schemes worth pursuing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion, the East Coast and Kallang Basin

Reclamation schemes will make available 2,000 acres  of

valuable  land, most of it in the city area.  The  land

will be available for the development of industrial and

housing    estates,   schools,   highways,   commercial

buildings,   and  holiday  resorts  with   hotels   and

recreational  facilities  for  tourists.  The  economic

benefits  in  terms of income and employment  generated

consequent on the completion of these schemes  will  be

substantial.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visible progress of urban redevelopment is evident

when  travelling along Chin Swee Road and Sumbawa Road.

Vast  areas  in  Precincts S.1 and N.l, which  together

comprise 225 acres, have been cleared. Earth works  and

the  construction  of  flats, shops  and  schools  have

already  begun.  While  the  acquisition  of  land  and

properties and the clearance and resettlement of people

are  a slow process, once completed, construction  work

can  proceed  rapidly. For this reason, expenditure  on

urban re-development in 1967 will be $15 million, which

is more than twice the amount spent this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development has two other

large  projects in hand for 1967. They are the National

Sports  Stadium  and the Erskine Hill office  building.

These schemes were initiated this year and work on them

will  continue up to 1968 or 1969 for their completion.

The National Sports Stadium will cost $18.5 million and

it  is proposed to reimburse the cost from the proceeds

of  the Singapore Sweep. As the Sweep was only launched

in  October this year, it may not be possible to derive

sufficient  funds  from  the Sweep  to  meet  necessary

payments  in  1967. For this reason, it is proposed  to

vote  $3 million in the Estimates for the project  next

year  and  to  recover it from the Sweep in  subsequent

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department will have a development

budget of $34.8 million in 1967, which is about a third

higher than the department's actual expenditure of  $26

million  in 1966. For roads and bridges a sum  of  $9.0

million   will  be  spent,  for  drainage   and   flood

alleviation $3.1 million, and for sewerage  works  $9.3

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although substantial investments have gone into the

opening  up  of new roads, the widening and improvement

of  existing  roads  into dual  carriageways,  and  the

introduction of one-way traffic systems, the problem of

traffic  congestion,  especially  in  the  city,  still

remains. This is evident from the frequent traffic jams

along main roads leading into the city. The P.W.D. has

recently set up a Special Traffic Unit to study this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



problem, and 1967 will see the beginning of changes  in

road  development. As part of the new scheme of things,

the construction of some flyovers will begin in certain

main  junctions,  notably the one at Woodsville  Circus

where  Serangoon, Upper Serangoon, MacPherson  and  the

New  Toa  Payoh  Roads meet. Another  flyover  will  be

constructed at the junction of Whitley, Thomson and the

New Toa Payoh Roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major project under drainage and flood

alleviation is the Bukit Timah Alleviation Scheme. This

scheme, when completed in 1969, will remove the present

serious  flooding in the Bukit Timah area  after  heavy

rain  storms. In 1967, $1 million will be spent on  the

Bukit  Timah project, which is expected to cost in  all

$6.8 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sewerage is an essential social overhead in any

modern  city.  The expansion of sewerage facilities  in

Singapore  needs to keep pace not only with  population

growth  but  also  with  urban  redevelopment  and  the

development  of new housing and industrial estates.  In

1967,  the  major schemes to be launched  or  continued

will  enable  an  extension  to  be  made  of  sewerage

facilities  to  Kallang Basin,  Jurong  and  the  urban

redevelopment precincts. Expenditure on treatment works

will also be substantial in 1967 because of the need to

increase  their capacity in step with the expansion  of

sewerage facilities.



<br><br><i>Economic Development Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board proposes to spend $45

million  in  1967, which is nearly 20 per  cent  higher

than  the  estimated expenditure of $38.0 million  this

year.  Industrial financing will claim $25  million  of

the  total,  while  infrastructure investment  for  the

expansion  of Jurong and other industrial estates  will

account for the balance of $20 million.



<br><br><i>Housing and Development Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, the Housing and Development Board is

expected  to complete 12,000 housing units  and  shops.

The  major development will be at Toa Payoh and Kampong

Tiong Bahru where it is proposed to build 10,000 units.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In urban redevelopment areas, about 2,000 units of

flats  and  shops will be completed before the  end  of

next year.



<br><br><i>Port of Singapore Authority</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority plans to step up its

expenditure  programme for 1967. It proposes  to  spend

$43.8  million next year, as compared to the  estimated

expenditure  of  only  $5.0  million  this   year,   an

eightfold   increase.  The  main  scheme   under   port

development will be the construction of four deep-water

berths at the East Lagoon which began this year. On com

pletion  of  this scheme in 1968-69 the  turn-round  of

ships  at  the Authority's wharves will be speeded  up.

The  construction of godowns and ancillary  works  will

also  be  undertaken to cope with  the  growth  in  the

number  of  vessels and the volume of goods handled  at

the Authority's wharves.



<br><br><i>Public Utilities Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board proposes to spend $83

million in 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Electricity, the main project is the Jurong

Power  Station  Phase I, the first two units  of  which

will   be   commissioned  during   the   Plan   period.

Preliminary  work  on the project  has  already  begun.

Construction  work  will be pursued expeditiously  next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion in generating capacity is justified on

two  grounds: firstly, the expectation of  increase  in

power consumption by industries, and, secondly, to meet

the  growth  in domestic consumption due to  population

growth and the extension of supplies to rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of generating capacity,

substantial  investments are necessary  to  extend  the

network  of  electrical transmission  and  distribution

lines.  In fact, capital investment in the distribution

network   will  be  $31.0  million  next  year,   which

constitutes  two-thirds  of the  total  budget  of  the

Electricity Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase I of the Johore River Scheme will be completed

next year and this will increase the reliable yield  of

water  supply  by  another 30 million  gallons  a  day,

bringing the total reliable yield



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



from  the various sources to 87 million gallons  a  day

for Singapore. The average yield will go up to over 130

million gallons per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gas Department will have a budget of $3.5 million

which  will  be  spent mainly on the extension  of  the

distribution network to bring gas to Toa Payoh, Bartley

and Upper Serangoon areas as well as to Telok Kurau and

Bedok areas.



<br><br><i>Singapore Telephone Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Telephone Board will spend $12.9

million  next year. Its major expenditure will  be  for

the  purchase  of  exchange  equipment  to  extend  the

capacity  of  existing telephone exchanges,  especially

those  serving the Katong and Bukit Panjang areas where

population has increased. To complement these  schemes,

the  underground cables and plant will be installed  to

link  the  exchanges with subscribers. It  is  expected

that  6,000  new  lines will be in service  next  year,

while the total at the end of this year will be 70,000.



<br><br><i>Sectoral   Allocation  of  Public  Sector   Development   Programme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals of ministries and statutory authorities

for 1967 in economic classification are as follows:



<pre>

                                         million

                                            $



                Economic Development      234.2       57.0%

                Social Development        148.1       36.1%

                Public Administration      28.7        6.9%

                   and Defence

                                          -----      ------

                Total                     411.0      100.0%

                                          =====      ======

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion's share of the allocation goes to economic

development  which is consistent with the objective  of

promoting  rapid  economic growth.  The  provision  for

social development ranks second in the Budget and  will

be  sufficient to maintain and improve the already high

standard of social services in Singapore.



<br><br><i>1967 Development Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to the financing of the Development

Expenditure  for 1967. Out of the estimated expenditure

of  $259.7 million by the statutory authorities, it  is

expected that $174.7 million will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



from their own resources or external loans, the balance

of $85 million will come as a loan from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development expenditure by the Government is

anticipated  to be $151.3 million. This, together  with

the loan of $85 million to the statutory authorities, a

loan  of  $3  million  to  the Government  Co-operative

Housing  Society,  and a transfer  of  $10  million  to

create  a  Contingency Fund, give  a  total  of  $249.3

million to be provided for on Government account.



<br><br><i>Financial Resources for the Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the 1967 Estimates total $249.3 million, the

anticipated expenditure is estimated at $211.4 million,

or  about 85 per cent of the total provision.  We  will

now examine the position of the Development Fund, which

is   the  source  of  finance  for  the  Estimates,  to

determine   how   it   will   meet   this   anticipated

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of the Development Fund at 31st December,

1965, was $179.7 million, while the inflow to the  Fund

this  year  (1966)  is expected to be  $171.3  million,

giving a total of $351 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure from the Fund this year is now

estimated  at  $212.9  million, which  means  that  the

balance in the Development Fund at 31st December, 1966,

will be $138.1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inflow into the Fund in 1967 is 57.0% expected to

be  $180.0 million. As the anticipated expenditure from

the Fund for 1967 is $211.4 million, the balance in the

Fund  at the end of 1967 will be around $106.7 million.

The  Government proposes to obtain loans from the World

Bank  and other financial institutions, as well as from

friendly   countries,   to  finance   its   development

programmes.  Hitherto, World Bank loans  have  gone  to

traditional  projects such as power  generation,  water

supplies  and  port  development. The  Government  will

continue to encourage the statutory authorities to seek

loans for such "bankable" projects, as well as for  new

schemes such as electricity and water transmission  and

internal   telephones.  Such  loans  will  enable   the

statutory authorities to reduce their dependence on the

Government for financing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Government sector loan applications will

shortly  be  submitted to the World Bank for education,

roads  and  sewerage development. As Singapore  has  an

excellent   record   of   well-planned   and   executed

development programmes, there will be a strong case for

additional  loan  financing from the  World  Bank.  The

World  Bank  has  financed  similar  schemes  in  other

countries. On the whole, the balance in the Development

Fund will be quite satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, though we are making progress, it

is  not fast enough to be self-sustaining nor is it  of

the   magnitude  required  to  solve  our  unemployment

problem.  We  must never forget that Singapore  has  no

agricultural  base. We do not have what the  economists

call  primary  income. Our earnings are  from  services

rendered, processing and refining of raw materials  and

manufacturing   -the   last  growing   in   importance.

Therefore,  if  we want to live well  and  improve  our

standard of living, it is imperative that we should  be

more  efficient than others. This calls for the closest

co-operation between Government, the entrepreneurs  and

labour  and  each must give of its best to bring  about

ever-increasing efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given all the incentives necessary

to attract investment and to provide both the necessary

infrastructure as well as a stable political climate to

make  investment  possible.  It  is  now  left  to  our

entrepreneurs  to  show that they  have  inherited  the

verve,  resilience, drive and skill of our  forefathers

and  take  advantage of the facilities  and  incentives

available.  The  Productivity Centre will  help  labour

achieve greater productivity and thereby contribute  to

our  efforts to industrialise and compete successfully.

Responsible trade union leaders know that it is through

greater  productivity  that wages  can  rise,  for  any

increase  in  wages without corresponding  increase  in

output will very quickly blunt our industrial drive and

add to our army of unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated before, the Government, apart from

providing the basic facilities already enumerated, will

hold



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



a  fair  balance between management and  labour.  While

seeing to it that there must not be any exploitation of

labour,  we must also ensure that entrepreneurs  get  a

fair return for their investment. Without profits there

will  be no investment and therefore no employment.  At

the  same  time  our society rightly expects  work  for

wages paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that

without  primary income we have no buffer to fall  back

on.  If there is a deterioration in the services we are

rendering or, worse still, a breakdown in the provision

of  such  services, inevitably this  would  lead  to  a

collapse  of  our  economy.  It  is  the  duty  of  the

Government  to  see that no section of  the  population

endangers  the  standard of efficiency, either  through

misunderstanding   of   the   situation   or    through

irresponsible   behaviour,  such  as  malingering   and

restrictive practices, which we see creeping  into  the

system.  Prompt and effective action will be  taken  to

stop the rot wherever it is found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic that the first full year after a

separation  we did not seek was better than  the  first

full year of a merger and Malaysia we sought and worked

for  so long and arduously. For the first full year  of

Malaysia  was the first full year of confrontation  and

saw our annual growth rate of 8.5 per cent go down to 2

per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has not been so with the first full year of

Independence  after  we  were suddenly  separated  from

Malaysia. Although the percentage increase of our Gross

National  Product is not as yet available, the  figures

show  an increase of between 9 per cent and 12 per cent

in  trade and revenue - cause for quiet confidence. But

this  confidence  must  not lead  us  to  smugness  and

complacency.  It  must  not lead  our  people,  whether

entrepreneurs, or trade unionists, into believing  that

the  world owes us a living and that things will always

be  all  right. They will be all right only if  we  are

constantly alert, efficient and striving. For  ours  is

not  any  ordinary  economy like  that  of  many  other

countries in this region. Our future is at once fraught

with  peril and yet bright with promise, depending upon

how things



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



work out in Asia as a whole. If big power conflicts are

contained   and   the   smaller   countries   turn   to

constructive pursuits, then we shall thrive and prosper

in  peace.  If not, we must inevitably be embroiled  in

grievous  strife, with big powers exploiting the  petty

feuds,  jealousies and rivalries. But these are matters

beyond  our  dispensation. What we can see  clearly  is

into  the  70's  for,  barring the unexpected,  we  can

assume a relatively quiet and secure situation in  this

corner  of  South-East Asia. But  we  have  lived  long

enough  to learn that the unexpected does often  happen

and  we are learning to make contingency provisions for

such accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been my good fortune as Finance Minister for

two  successive years not to have had to raise  revenue

by  increases in the rates of taxation. This year,  the

only  change is in the method of computing  the  motor-vehicle  tax, which will bring in a small  increase  of

$5½  million in revenue, a step we are taking  more  to

establish  sound principles of taxation than  the  need

for  the $5½ million. But Singapore cannot assume that

the  expanding  cost of education,  health  and  social

services,  plus  added burdens of our separate  defence

expenditure, can always look after themselves.  On  the

one  hand,  my officials have had to do their unpopular

duty of using the pruning knife whenever they feel that

an  item of expenditure was extravagant in relation  to

our  own  economic  capacity. On the  other  hand,  our

entrepreneurs  and workers must give of their  best  to

keep  this  economy humming and thriving, so  that  the

increased  economic  activity  will  always   give   an

increasing revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided there is a clear appreciation of the

elementary  facts  of  life in our  lean  society,  and

provided  that  each and every sector plays  its  part,

there is no reason at all why we should not be able  to

achieve  our goal of a better life for all. Our  people

have  got what it takes to make Singapore prosper. What

is  required now is an awareness of the problems before

us  and a concerted response made to meet the challenge

of our separate destiny. Together



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



we  should  be  able to surge forward to a  better  and

brighter future.

<div align="center"><b>WOMEN'S CHARTER (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill makes a number of significant amendments to

the Women's Charter, 1961. The Explanatory Statement to

the  Bill  sets  out  in detail  the  reasons  for  the

amendments, and for this reason and also because it  is

proposed  to  refer this Bill to a Select Committee  if

its  Second  Reading is approved, I do not  propose  to

deal  in  detail with the amendments proposed. I  shall

only  confine  myself to a few of the amendments  which

affect the principle of the legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Women's Charter, 1961, was to

bring  all  marriages  (other  than  Muslim  marriages)

solemnised  in  Singapore  within  the  ambit  of   the

Charter,  so that all such marriages in Singapore  will

be  solemnised  and registered under the Charter.  This

clearly has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



not  been achieved, for there are still a large  number

of  Chinese  customary marriages  which  appear  to  be

solemnised  outside the Ordinance.  It  is,  therefore,

proposed  to amend the Ordinance to make it clear  that

Chinese  customary  marriages  will  come  within   the

provisions  of  the  Ordinance and that  they  must  be

solemnised and registered under the provisions  of  the

Ordinance.  Let  me  at once say that  it  is  not  the

intention  of the Government to prevent such  customary

marriages from taking place, as it is not the intention

of   the  Government  to  prevent  Christian  or  Hindu

marriages from being solemnised in Singapore. All  that

will  be  required will be that a person, before  going

through  a  Chinese customary marriage,  should  comply

with  the  provisions  of  the  Ordinance  relating  to

freedom to marry, age and consent. All persons will  be

required to obtain a certificate for marriage under the

provisions  of the Ordinance, but once he has  obtained

this,  he  is  free to have his marriage solemnised  or

performed or carried out in any way he likes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major amendment in the Bill relates to the

rights of married women as regards their property.  The

Bill seeks to make it clear that married women may deal

with their property in the same way as men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill next seeks to bring the law relating to

divorce  in  line  with  recent  legislation  in  other

Commonwealth  countries. When the Women's  Charter  was

enacted,  the provisions of the Divorce Ordinance  were

incorporated  in it without any substantial  amendment.

The law relating to divorce has, however, moved forward

and the tendency in many countries is to recognise what

is  known as the "breakdown" principle - that is,  that

if a marriage is broken down and the Court is satisfied

that  the  parties can no longer live with each  other,

then it is right that the marriage should be put an end

to.  This  principle, Mr Speaker, Sir, which has  been

accepted  in  Australia and New  Zealand  and  in  many

European  countries, is adopted in the  amending  Bill.

The  Bill also seeks to provide more opportunities  for

reconciliation before a divorce is decreed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that the children of void or

voidable marriages should be regarded as legitimate, as

it   is  not  their  fault  that  their  parents   have

contracted the void marriage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that the Bill will be welcomed as a

further  step  in  the improvement of the  position  of

women and children in our family law. The rationale  of

the Bill is that the happiness of the family should  be

fostered by the law, but when all efforts fail,  it  is

better for the parties to part rather than to be forced

to live together in unhappiness and strife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Women's Charter was formulated in  1961  and

passed   in  that  year.  By  its  enactment,  we   can

understand that the purpose is to enhance the  position

of  women in Singapore, to enable them to secure  their

rightful place in society - equal to men - and to  enjoy

the  same  rights  and privileges  as  men.  Since  its

introduction  and during the period of its enforcement,

we  have found that certain provisions in the Ordinance

cannot  give effect to the purpose that we  intend.  As

these  provisions do not achieve the  purpose,  it  is,

therefore, proper and correct that the Minister  should

introduce amending legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is something in this amending Bill which I

regret  very  much. The Minister has  omitted  a  point

which is more important than what he has said. This  is

in  relation  to the representation which the  previous

Minister  received  from  the Women's  Section  in  the

P.A.P.  The  representation  stated  that  the  Women's

Charter, in addition to enabling women to secure  their

equal  and  rightful  place in Singapore,  should  also

eradicate  the practice of polygamy - the  practice  of

having  three  wives and four concubines  -  which  has

caused  disharmony  in the family and  disturbance  and

disquiet  in  our society. According to  the  law  then

prevailing, certainly if any one wanted to marry he had

to  register  under  the Women's  Charter  to  get  his

marriage legalised before it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



recognised  by  the  law. Then would  the  practice  of

monogamy be effected. But we have found that there is a

big  loophole.  This is in regard to the definition  of

the  word  "mistress". A man can have  many  mistresses

outside  his family. If he does not register,  then  in

the  eyes  of the law he cannot be punished,  and  this

invariably constitutes a system of polygamy.  From  the

time  when the Women's Charter was enforced up to  now,

we  have  found  that the number of divorces  has  been

quite high. This has been due mainly to such a practice

as  I  have  said,  that is to say, though  women  have

nominal  protection  under the law,  the  law  has,  in

effect,  not  provided  actual  protection  for   them,

because   their  husbands  could  cohabit   with   many

mistresses outside their homes. As a result,  it  leads

to  disharmony  in the family which in  turn  leads  to

divorces. All this is because of the definition of  the

word "mistress" which is not clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out something about clause 28

in  the amending Bill before us today. This appears  on

page  8, line 35, in which connection the Minister  has

mentioned  divorce just now. When a  couple  have  been

married  for  some time and find that they cannot  live

together,   they  separate.  During  their  period   of

separation,  they  may hope to resume their  harmonious

relationship and live together again. But this amending

Bill  provides that if after seven years of  separation

they  cannot  hope  to  be  united  again,  then  their

separation   can  be  confirmed.  Arising   from   this

provision, the pretext, "I am not satisfied and  cannot

live  happily with my wife," can be used as  an  excuse

for  divorce to marry someone else. During this  period

of  separation the law does not provide the couple with

any  means to reconciliate or to be reunited. So I feel

that   this   provision  in  the  Bill  is  not   quite

satisfactory,  that  if a husband, whose  marriage  was

registered  under the law, finds that  he  cannot  live

together with his wife again after a period of 7 years,

he  could  ask for a divorce. Why should  a  period  of

seven years be provided? That is not quite correct.  We

should have a proper and more effective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



provision  in the law to prohibit or restrict  the  man

from  getting more mistresses outside the home.  As  it

is,  the Women's Charter will be ineffective. In  other

words,  we  want to implement the law to protect  women

and enhance their position in society, and generally to

improve  society  as  a  whole. This  amending  law  is

providing  men with more opportunities to  evade  their

rightful  duties to their wives, which will worsen  the

women's  position. Is this in keeping with  the  P.A.P.

policy as promised to the electorate in 1959? I do  not

agree with this provision in clause 28, and I hope  the

Minister will reconsider it when the Bill is in  Select

Committee,  in  the  hope that women  can  enjoy  their

rightful  place  in the new society now that  Singapore

has  advanced from self-government to independence. In

this new era women should be enabled under the aegis of

the Government to develop their strength and ability to

serve  the country and contribute to the betterment  of

society.



<br><br>6.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although I am

physically  occupying a seat customarily  reserved  for

the Opposition, let me assure you that my heart is with

the  Government. In this respect, I am sure I speak for

all  my  colleagues on this side of the  House.  It  is

fitting   that  I  should  now  rise  to  support   the

Government on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter is one of the noted pieces of

social  legislation  introduced by the  Government.  It

seeks to protect the rights and interests of women  and

children in the Republic and to abolish polygamy.  When

it  was introduced in 1961, it demolished, as it  were,

by  a stroke of the pen, the polygamous haven that  was

Singapore, no doubt to the regret of many a polygamist!

The  Charter  has been in existence for the  last  five

years,  and  during  this time certain  loopholes  were

discovered.  It  is  appropriate  that  the  Government

should now take stock of this piece of legislation  and

try to bring it up to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was rather surprised just now when I heard the hon.

Member for Delta criticising one of the clauses in  the

Bill. This clause seeks to permit the dissolution of  a

marriage after separation for seven years, during which

time   all   attempts  at  reconciliation   have   been

unsuccessful. It would appear, from what she has  said,

that once a marriage is contracted, it should never  be

dissolved. That, Mr Speaker, I cannot agree to  and  I

do   not   think  it  is  in  line  with  present   day

sociological trends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the basic unit of a country is the

family.  Whether  a  country is  happy  or  progressive

depends upon whether this basic -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

can  I  clarify  in a few sentences? Just  now  I  have

clearly  pointed out that the Minister in this amending

Bill  has provided one redundant clause, namely, clause

28.  I do not mean that once a person is married he  or

she  should  not  be  allowed  to  divorce  for  proper

reasons,  because  the  law  clearly  and  specifically

provides  that when a couple have registered under  the

Ordinance  for two years, any one party  who  has  been

cruelly  treated,  or  has any dissatisfaction  or  has

sufficient reasons, could petition for a divorce.  Then

why  have this redundant clause saying that after seven

years  they can petition for a divorce? Since they  are

already  allowed, after two years, to  petition  for  a

divorce, why should you now add seven years? This would

encourage  a  husband to leave his wife to  get  a  new

wife.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no

experience in matters matrimonial, but I can assure the

hon.  Member for Delta that seven years is a long  time

to wait, and if I were -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, are you speaking with the

experience of a bachelor of seven years' standing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am speaking, Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  a bachelor of 34 years' standing! Mr Speaker, Sir,

country is happy or progressive depends upon its  basic

unit, that is, the family. As I see it, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there is no point in keeping two persons together

who cannot agree with each other and who hate the sight

of  each other and are at loggerheads all the time.  It

would  not  then be a holy wedlock but it  would  be  a

wholly  deadlock if the hon. Member for Delta  had  her

way!  I am glad that the Government is committing  this

amendment  Bill  to  a Select Committee  and  no  doubt

representations   from  the  public,  especially   from

organisations connected with children and  women,  will

be  made to this Committee. I wish the Select Committee

well  in its deliberations. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

this amendment Bill in principle.

connection with clause 28 of this amendment Bill, if  a

man  has  been  separated for seven  years,  what  will

happen  to  his life? The period of separation  is  not

proper,  because  if  a man and a  girl  want  to  live

properly, then the number of years of separation should

be  reduced. Only then will their future be  happy.  My

request  is  that  the period of separation  should  be

reduced or deleted.

<div align="center"><b>INSURANCE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill re-enacts the provisions

of  the  Insurance  Act, 1963, of  Malaysia  which  was

extended  to Singapore in January 1965 and which  after

separation  is  still  operative  in  Singapore   until

repealed. Hon. Members of the House may ask why it  has

been found necessary to re-enact the provisions of this

Act. This is due to the following main reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Statutory deposits in respect of insurance

companies  operating in Singapore are kept  by  the

Malaysian  Accountant General and can no longer  be

called  upon  to  cover  liabilities  of  Singapore

insurers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) By virtue of the fact that Singapore is no longer

a  part  of  the Federation of Malaysia,  Singapore

securities are now automatically excluded from  the

schedule of approved assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It is desirable that some amendments which have

been  made  to  the Malaysian Act since  separation

should   also  be  incorporated  in  the  Singapore

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly the Bill is a comprehensive piece of

legislation  designed  to  control  and  supervise  the

conduct  of all types of insurance business. The  basic

objective  of the Bill is to prevent the repetition  of

unscrupulous practices like those of mushroom insurance

companies  and  to  encourage  the  growth  of  healthy

insurance business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the contents of the Bill, I would like

to elaborate on the more salient clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill classifies insurance business

into  two  main categories, namely, life insurance  and

general insurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 lay down the minimum conditions of

operations of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



insurance    companies   in   Singapore.   These    are

registration   with  the  Insurance  Commissioner   and

lodging  a statutory deposit of $300,000 for each  type

of  insurance  business  conducted.  In  addition,  the

Commissioner must be satisfied that an insurer applying

for  registration must have a surplus  of  assets  over

liabilities of not less than $1 million if he  proposes

to  carry  on  one  type of insurance  business,  or  a

surplus  of  assets over liabilities of  at  least  $l½

million  if  he  proposes to carry  on  both  types  of

insurance business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill specify the type of

assets  that  may  be  accepted as statutory  deposits.

These  are  cash,  approved securities  listed  in  the

Second  Schedule  to this Bill, bank  covenants,  or  a

combination  of  any of these items. As  the  statutory

deposit  can  be regarded as a final safeguard  of  the

interests of policy holders, it logically follows  that

the  securities  deposited have to be of  the  soundest

type,  and it is for this reason that the Minister  has

been given discretionary powers to refuse acceptance of

securities  which  are considered not satisfactory  for

the   purposes  of  a  statutory  deposit.  With   this

objective  in mind, I shall be introducing an amendment

to  clause  8 during the Committee Stage of  the  House

which  will enable the Minister to limit the amount  of

statutory deposit lodged in the form of bank covenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill requires insurers to establish

and  maintain  an  insurance  fund  for  each  type  of

insurance  business  conducted  for  the  purposes   of

meeting liabilities of Singapore policies.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim, could I just interrupt you to

ask  for  the co-operation of Members on this  side  to

turn off the speakers that are close to them? There are

some   speakers  that  are  on  and  they  are   rather

distracting.  As  Mr Lim continues to  speak,  perhaps

Members may be able to detect them. Yes, Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Clause 11 stipulates that a minimum

of  55  per cent of the assets of the fund must consist

of  approved securities which are listed in the  Second

Schedule to this Bill. As



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



assets  in  the Second Schedule are local in character,

this  provision makes it necessary for insurers to keep

in  Singapore, local assets to match at  least  55  per

cent  of the liabilities they have contracted.  It  has

been  found that, with regard to some general insurance

companies,  outstanding premiums and  agents'  balances

comprise a disproportionately large percentage  of  the

total  assets of their insurance funds. This is clearly

undesirable as the solvency of the fund is dependent on

the  extent to which such premiums and balances can  be

collected.  Clause 11 (2) of the Bill therefore  limits

such  balances and premiums to l2½ per cent of  written

premiums.  To allow insurers to achieve this percentage

smoothly   and  with  minimum  difficulty, a   2-year

transitional  period is allowed during  which  insurers

are   required  gradually  to  reduce  the  amount   of

outstanding premiums and agents' balances held as  part

of  their insurance funds until the target of  12½  per

cent is achieved. Again I wish to state here, Sir, that

during  the  Committee Stage of the House,  I  will  be

proposing an amendment to this clause which will  allow

the  Minister to increase the minimum percentage of  55

per  cent and to specify the minimum or maximum  amount

of  this 55 per cent that may be invested in any one or

more of the items listed in the Second Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15 and 23 relate specifically to life

insurance  companies. Clause 15 provides  that  premium

rates  charged  by  life insurance  companies  must  be

approved by qualified actuaries, whilst clause 23 makes

it necessary for regular actuarial investigations to be

made into the financial condition of the life insurance

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of clause 22, all insurance

companies are required to lodge annual returns with the

Commissioner. The Commissioner can request insurers  to

furnish  him with information related to their business

if the information is required for the proper discharge

of his functions under the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 lays down the conditions under which the

Commissioner  may institute an investigation  into  the

whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



or  part  of  the business of an insurer.  Among  these

conditions  are failure on the part of the  insurer  to

comply  with  any provisions of this Bill  relating  to

insurance  funds, and if it appears to the Commissioner

that the insurer is likely to become unable to meet his

obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 relates to winding up of insurance

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 provides for transfers of business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 35 provides for the appointment of an

Insurance    Commissioner   by   the   Minister.    The

Commissioner would be responsible for administering the

Bill  and  would exercise the functions conferred  upon

him  by  this  Bill. The Commissioner  is  required  to

submit  an  annual report to the Minister,  a  copy  of

which is to be presented to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of clause 45, the Minister may

make  regulations for carrying into effect the  objects

of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Schedule to the Bill lists the definitions

of   insurance   terms;  the  Second   Schedule   lists

authorised   Singapore  assets  for  the  purposes   of

statutory  deposits  and  insurance  funds;  the  Third

Schedule  relates to deposits required to be lodged  by

associations  of underwriters; and the Fourth  Schedule

specifies documents to be lodged annually by insurers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from the amendments to

clauses  8  and  11 which I have mentioned  earlier,  I

propose to suggest a few other minor amendments to  the

Bill during the Committee Stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this

Bill  is  a  good  one. It is designed to  control  and

regulate the insurance industry in Singapore.  My  only

criticism  of this Bill is that it is not comprehensive

enough,  especially in regard to motor  insurance.  The

law  with regard to motor insurance at present requires

compulsory third-party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



insurance.  But  third-party insurance,  unfortunately,

does  not include passenger liability. I would  request

the   Government   to   consider  including   passenger

liability  possibly in an amendment to the Third  Party

Risks   and   Compensation  Ordinance  as   third-party

liability. Under the existing law, Mr Speaker, Sir, an

insurance company can still avoid liability with regard

to third-party risks in certain circumstances. This may

be  just  in  respect of the insured, but it definitely

works an injustice towards the injured third party.  To

overcome this, possibly Government can consider setting

up  an  insurance  compensation  fund.  This  could  be

contributed  to by the insurance companies  undertaking

motor insurance business. The alternative is to require

insurance  companies to insure drivers with  regard  to

third-party risks rather than insuring cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the House an example. Many of our

Government  Front-benchers are accomplished golfers.  I

understand the Minister concerned with this Bill is one

of  them. A golfer should insure himself against third-party liability, in case he hits the ball into somebody

instead  of  into  the  hole. The present  position  of

insuring cars instead of insuring drivers is as  absurd

as  insuring the golfers' clubs rather than the golfers

themselves against third-party liability. Yet we  think

nothing of that. May I recommend the Minister in charge

of  this  Bill to spend a few thoughts on  this  point,

possibly between golf shots?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also clause 8 of the Bill enables an insurer to get

out of the deposit by getting a bank covenant. No doubt

the primary object of requiring the $300,000 deposit is

that   there  should  be  enough  money  to   pay   any

compensation when compensation is payable.  But  surely

there should be a secondary object, that this amount of

money  should  be  invested in  securities,  especially

securities of local industries. So this requirement  of

a $300,000 deposit would kill two birds with one stone.

It  would  also  oblige insurance companies  to  invest

their money locally.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

good Bill on the whole, and with the exception of these

minor criticisms, I support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am most grateful

to  the  hon. Member for giving me food for thought  in

between my golf shots! This is the initial step that we

are  taking to control insurance. I am sure, as  we  go

on,  we  will do everything that is desirable  to  make

this Bill as fitting as is possible for Singapore.  The

points  that  he has put up are of a technical  nature,

and  I  am sure much thought has been given to them  by

other   countries.  It  would  be  the  duty   of   the

Commissioner  so  appointed to bring  all  the  salient

features  of insurance business all over the  world  to

our  notice,  and  it  would be our  duty  to  keep  on

improving  the Ordinance as time goes on. But  for  our

purpose  now,  since  we  are  repealing  the  Malaysia

Insurance Act, as an initial step I would request  that

we allow this Bill to go through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Clause 11 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 12, after line 37, to add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that the Minister may, in his discretion by

order published in the Gazette -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) increase the percentage referred to in this

both minimum and maximum percentages of the

total value of the assets of the fund that

insurers may hold of any one or more of the

items set out in the Second Schedule to this Act.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been explained, the provisions of clause 11

require  insurance companies operating in Singapore  to

establish  and maintain an insurance fund of  which  at

least  55  per cent of the assets must be local  assets

listed  in the Second Schedule. Paragraph (a)  of  this

amendment enables the Minister to increase this 55  per

cent  if necessary. Whilst the provisions of clause  11

stipulate a minimum investment of 55 per cent in  local

assets,  there is no provision to require  insurers  to

hold  a  well-distributed portfolio of  investments  in

their insurance fund. The amendment at paragraph (b) is

therefore  being  introduced  to  take  care   of   the

situation  when insurers invest a large  proportion  of

their  funds  in  one type of asset.  This  is  clearly

undesirable as the solvency and liquidity of  the  fund

is dependent on only one type of asset.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Entertainments Duty Ordinance provides that

the  rates of duty to be levied on different  types  of

entertainment  have to be approved by a  resolution  of

Parliament  from time to time. This is administratively

inconvenient in that if it is desired to vary the  rate

of  duty for any particular entertainment, it cannot be

done without reference to Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to repeal section 4 of the

Ordinance and provides the Minister with the  power  to

levy different rates by order published in the Gazette.

This  allows for greater flexibility and is in  keeping

with  the  powers  of  the  Minister  in  other  fiscal

legislation, for example, in the Customs laws.  As  the

law  now stands, there is no provision for the Minister

to  exempt any class of entertainment from the  payment

of entertainments duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to grant the Minister powers to exempt

any  particular case from the payment of entertainments

duty  subject  to  such conditions as may  be  imposed.

Permissive   powers  for  the  Minister  to   prescribe

different  rates of duty and to exempt  any  particular

case   will   allow   for  administrative   simplicity,

especially  in cases where it is desired  to  stimulate

particular types of sport which may need assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the Government Contracts Ordinance, 1949,

Bill   is   to  repeal  the  Malaysian  Ordinance   and

substitute it with the Government Contracts Act, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to enact with suitable amendments the

provisions of the Government Contracts Ordinance, 1949,

authorise a public officer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



to  sign  a  contract. The new Bill  before  the  House

provides that authorisation of officers will be only by

the  Minister  for  Finance.  As  contracts  invariably

involve  financial  matters, it is desirable  that  the

authority be from the Minister for Finance. In  respect

of  contracts signed outside Singapore, this  authority

is also to be vested in the Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present there is provision under section 37

(2) of the Income Tax Ordinance for the approval of  an

institution  as "an institution of a public  character"

whereby an amount equal to the sum contributed  to  the

said   institution  is  an  allowable  deduction   from

assessable income for income tax purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under paragraph (c) of the above sub-section "an

institution  of a public character" is  defined  as  an

institution  or fund in Singapore under  one  of  seven

categories,  including "a public  or  other  benevolent

institution not operated or conducted for profit".  The

phrase  is  ambiguous because of the word  "other",  so

that  this  category  is restricted  to  either  public

benevolent   or   other  benevolent  institutions   not

conducted for profit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the provision now stands, its benefits cannot be

extended to deserving public institutions which do  not

strictly   fall   within  the   legal   definition   of

"benevolent". To give greater flexibility to approve  a

public  institution  not  strictly  benevolent,  it  is

proposed that section 37 (2) (c) (ii) should be amended

by deleting the word "other" in the phrase "a public or

other benevolent institution".

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Singapore Railways

Ordinance  to  enable  automatic  half-barriers  to  be

installed  at five railway level crossings  in  Jurong.

Under   section  17  of  the  Ordinance,  the  Malayan

Railway, which has extended its services to the  Jurong

Industrial Estate, is required to provide manned  gates

at  level crossings. Owing to the prohibitive costs  of

operating manned gates, the Railway Administration  has

suggested the installation of automatic half -barriers,

and  at  some  of  the crossings where traffic  is  not

heavy,  for  such crossings to be declared  open  level

crossings without any gates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board supports the

installation  of automatic half-barriers  as  they  are

expected to provide more efficient services - costs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



of  employing gate-keepers and provision of houses  for

gate-keepers  would be eliminated  and  delay  to  road

traffic curtailed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow the installation of automatic half-barriers, it is necessary to amend section 17 of the

Singapore   Railways  Ordinance.  The  amendment   will

empower  the Minister to exempt certain level crossings

from  the requirement to have manually operated  gates.

However, the Railway Administration will be required to

erect warning boards alongside the public road as  well

as whistle signs upon the railway at suitable distances

from the level crossings.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Nanyang University Ordinance,

1959,   which  this  Bill  seeks  to  introduce,   were

initiated  by  the  Nanyang University  Council.  These

amendments  have been the subject of deliberations  and

consultation  among Council members,  officials  of  my

Ministry,  and  the law officers of the Republic  since

June  1964, when the Special Liaison Committee  of  the

Singapore  Government  and representatives  of  Nanyang

University  reached agreement on the reorganisation  of

Nanyang University.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall that the Special Liaison

Committee's  agreement  contained,  among  others,  the

following clauses. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Nanyang University should be reorganised at an

early date. The details of reorganisation to be left to

the future Nanyang University Council using the Nanyang

University  Review  Committee Report  and  the  Nanyang

University  Ordinance  as  the  basis  for  formulating

measures for reorganisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) After reorganisation, the Singapore Government

will treat Nanyang University on the same basis as  the

University of Singapore so as to effect a reduction  in

student  fees  and  increase in  staff  emoluments  and

further improvements in equipment and facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) After reorganisation Nanyang University must

become a purely academic institution and should not  be

manipulated   or   influenced  by  any   political   or

subversive activities."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement also provided for a new Nanyang

University   Council  of  28  members,  comprising   12

representatives,  one each from the then  12  Malaysian

States,  six Government representatives, three of  whom

would  be  reserved  for  other  State  Governments  of

Malaysia,   three  representatives   of   the   Senate,

including  the Vice-Chancellor, two representatives  of

the  Guild  of  Graduates and five  community  leaders.

However,  before  this part of the agreement  could  be

implemented, Singapore was evicted from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequent upon separation and the emergence of

Singapore as an independent and sovereign Republic,  it

is only logical that Nanyang University, which has been

financed   largely   by  grants  from   the   Singapore

Government   since  1964,  should  be   controlled   by

Singapore   members  in  respect  of  its  policy   and

management.

consisting of -

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only the beginning. As reorganisation gathers

momentum,    the   Singapore   Government's   financial

commitment  towards the University will increase.  Even

now  the cost of maintaining a Nanyang student is about

$2,000  a year. Malaysian students who pay $720 a  year

in  fee  without  any  assistance  from  the  Malaysian

Government  are being subsidised by the Government  and

people  of  Singapore at the rate of about  $1,300  per

student per year. At the same time, contributions  from

the  private  sector  in support of Nanyang  University

have dwindled to negligible sums. In point of fact, the

total  amount of private donations collected since  the

establishment  of  Nanyang University  is  considerably

less  than  what  the public has been led  to  believe.

According   to   figures  published  in   the   Nanyang

University  Tenth  Anniversary  Souvenir,  the   amount

collected from 1963 to 1965 was only $12,070,000.  This

was  the sum collected in dribs and drabs over a period

of 13 years as compared with the $6.7 million which the

Singapore Government has spent on the University during

the  last  two and a half years. It is also significant

that of the $12 million raised from the private sector,

Singapore,  exclusive of Government  grants,  accounted

for  80  per  cent of this $12 million,  while  others,

including  all  the  constituent  States  of  Malaysia,

accounted  for  only 20 per cent. In the circumstances,

it  is  only  right and proper that Singapore  citizens

should  have  the  final say on how Nanyang  University

should  be  run.  However, if, as reported  in  today's

Eastern  Sun, certain Malaysian parents of the expelled

students believe that Singapore citizens who are paying

for  practically  the  whole cost  of  running  Nanyang

University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



should  not  have a dominant say in its  affairs,  then

they can always set up their own university or persuade

their own Government to set up a Chinese University  in

Malaysia,  and the Singapore Government will  undertake

to  refund every cent that the Malaysians have  donated

towards the establishment of Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 7 of the

Bill  before the House provides for a 21-member Council

consisting  of  the Vice-Chancellor, 2 members  elected

from the Senate, 2 members from the Guild of Graduates,

3  members  elected by members of the  University  from

amongst  themselves, 7 members appointed by the Council

from  persons  prominent  in the  field  of  education,

culture,  industry or commerce, and 6 members appointed

by  the  Government of whom 3 may be  persons  resident

outside Singapore. In making possible participation  of

persons  resident  outside Singapore in  the  governing

body of Nanyang, the present University Council and the

Government  are mindful of the support Malaysians  have

given  to  the University in the past and  the  sincere

desire to preserve the sentimental link between Nanyang

University and the Malaysian people who, we hope,  will

continue  to  support  the  University  financially  or

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide for continuity in policy making,

this  Bill  also seeks to extend the term of office  of

Council members from two to four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments proposed in this Bill are of a

minor  character. Provision is made for the appointment

of   a  Deputy  Vice-Chancellor  to  assist  the  Vice-Chancellor in carrying out his onerous duties. Such  an

appointment  has  been found to be  essential  in  most

universities  in  the  world. At  the  same  time,  the

designations  of some existing posts in the  University

as  laid  down  in the Ordinance are to be  changed  to

conform   to   designations  currently  used   in   the

University.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.36 p.m.



<br><br>As such, the office of the President as provided for in

the  Ordinance  is  to  be changed  to  that  of  Vice-Chancellor, which has been the designation  used  since

1960.  Similarly,  the designations  of  Secretary  and

Treasurer  are  to be changed to Registrar  and  Bursar

respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the existing Ordinance has two separate

sections  to  provide similar powers to the  University

Council.  Section 29 provides for rules to be  made  by

the Council and section 32 provides for statutes to  be

made.  In order to avoid duplication without curtailing

the  powers of the Council, this Bill seeks to  enlarge

the  powers of the Council to make rules and remove its

power  to  make  statutes.  This  is  accomplished   by

conferring  on the Council the power to make additional

rules  governing the powers and duties of the  officers

of  the University; the composition, powers, duties and

procedure of the Senate and the Guild of Graduates, and

the  discipline and welfare of students. With this  new

provision  all  the matters at present  dealt  with  by

statutes  will  be  adequately covered  by  rules,  and

section  32 providing for the Council to make  statutes

may therefore be repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these improvements in the Nanyang University

Ordinance,  there is reason to believe  that  continued

support for the University will be forthcoming not only

from  Singapore but also from Malaysia.  Of  the  1,678

students  at present in Nanyang University, 840  or  50

per cent are from Malaysia. As I have said earlier, the

Singapore  Government  has been  subsidising  each  and

every  one  of these students at the rate of  $1,300  a

year,  and  the  cost will increase  as  reorganisation

proceeds  apace. Clearly the Government and the  people

of Singapore should not be expected to bear this burden

indefinitely without assistance. On our part, Singapore

will   continue  to  welcome  students  from   Malaysia

provided they are here to seek knowledge, to acquire an

education and to make use of our facilities;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



which are lacking in their own country. If, instead  of

doing  this,  as  so many have done in the  past,  they

become  stooges  of  Communist front organisations  and

engage  in  subversive activities, then Singapore  will

have no alternative but to send them home. However,  we

are  hopeful that the unhappy events of the  past  will

not  recur  and  that  a  new breed  of  students  from

Malaysia  will  join  their brethren  in  Singapore  at

Nanyang  solely  for the pursuit of knowledge  so  that

under  the  guidance  of  the new  policy  makers,  the

administrators  and the teachers, the  University  will

develop  into  a true centre of learning  not  only  in

Singapore but in the whole of South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on the question of amending the  Nanyang

University  Ordinance,  I, as  a  graduate  of  Nanyang

University,  am particularly concerned with  this  Bill

and I feel that it is necessary to speak my mind on it.

In  the  first place, I wish to say in all  earnestness

that  I  support the amendments to the existing Nanyang

University Ordinance, which is an Ordinance drafted and

passed  into law by the Lim Yew Hock regime before  the

P.A.P. came  to  power.  This  Ordinance  came   into

operation on 27th May, 1959. Several years have elapsed

and  Nanyang University has developed. During this time

we have discovered that the Ordinance has not been able

to  withstand  the  test  of time.  There  are  certain

unsatisfactory features in it. For example,  section  9

provides  for a Register of members being kept  by  the

Secretary.  But in the subsection there is a  provision

regarding  the withdrawal of membership and the  letter

of  withdrawal  is  to be addressed  to  the  Registrar

instead of the Secretary of the University Council. All

this  is  very  confusing,  and  in  implementing   the

Ordinance, we find many defects in it. So this  is  not

ideal legislation. The existing Ordinance is unable  to

keep  pace with the progress of Nanyang University and,

even from the legislative point of view, it is far from

closely knit. This was drafted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



some  ten years ago, and even at that time it was found

to  be defective. And at the present moment, it is even

more   defective.  I  shall,  therefore,  support   the

amendments to the existing Ordinance. They must be made

to   meet   the  progressive  requirements  of  Nanyang

University.   Otherwise,   the   Ordinance   will    be

inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, talking about the Constitution of the

University,  this  is a statutory corporation.  So  its

membership has statutory force, and this is  the  basis

on  which  we  must  work. At  the  time  when  Nanyang

University was first established, the sponsors, perhaps

because  of  their desire to have more  donations  from

people in all walks of life, welcomed all persons to be

members  of the University. But after several years  of

development, in so far as the members of the University

are  concerned, they must have a new attitude and a new

outlook. It is not just a matter of accepting donations

from  the people. It is also a matter of administrative

control and certain adjustments should be made to  meet

Nanyang University's developing requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the existing Ordinance of Nanyang University,

we  can see that there are several grades of membership

of  Nanyang University. If a person donates $1,000,  he

can become a patron for life. If he pays up to $10,000,

he  can become a life member. All these provisions  are

very   defective,   because  there  are   no   detailed

provisions of a comprehensive nature to keep pace  with

the development of the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant given by the Government of Singapore to

Nanyang  University amounts to millions of dollars.  As

the   Minister  has  already  indicated,  the  question

definitely  arises  as to whether  the  Government  has

become  a  permanent patron of Nanyang  University.  So

even in law itself, there is a problem. According to, I

think, Rule 13 of the Second Schedule to the Ordinance,

when  a  patron is required to vote, he  can  have  one

vote.  In the general meeting, the Government  is  also

entitled  to  one  vote in its capacity  as  a  member.

Perhaps we can try to solve this problem through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



legislative  procedure or by adding certain  provisions

to the existing Ordinance. But this is not mentioned in

the present amendment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that under the existing Ordinance of

Nanyang University, so long as a person donates $1,000,

he  can become a member, but there is no restriction on

the  membership,  be he a resident,  a  criminal  or  a

winner  of  a  four-digit lottery! This is a  situation

which demands our attention, because if some people who

are  believers in Communism are rich enough  to  become

members  of Nanyang University, then they can  organise

themselves.  They can have 2,000 persons paying  $1,000

each,  and  they can then control the University  under

the  existing  Ordinance. This is a big loophole  which

can  be  exploited.  We must therefore  take  steps  to

attend to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, members of the Nanyang University are

not  confined to Singapore alone. Some are in Hongkong,

Indonesia,  Thailand  and Malaysia.  According  to  the

Singapore Republic Independence Constitution, there  is

a   provision   concerning  membership   in   statutory

corporations. Any person or group of persons  who  want

to  become  members  of  any  statutory  body,  or  any

corporation  of  a statutory nature,  must  have  their

names approved by the President and gazetted. So  I  do

not  know  whether some Malaysians, who are members  of

Nanyang  University under the existing  Ordinance,  are

still considered members. I would like clarification on

this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one question regarding the election of three

members  to  the  University  Council  at  the  general

meeting.  We  all  know  that the  members  of  Nanyang

University  are many in number. So any general  meeting

will  be  something  like a mass  rally.  Some  of  the

members  are spread out over various places and  it  is

difficult to hold a general meeting. Experience in  the

past few years has shown that a general meeting of Nanyang  University is convened on the basis  of  a  State

representatives' general meeting. So  if  you  consider

this in the light of the provisions of the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



Independence Ordinance, you will realise that  some  of

the  members  who are representatives will  lose  their

membership,  unless  the  President  of  Singapore  has

gazetted  their  names as members of a statutory  body.

Under these circumstances, how can we convene a general

meeting? Does it mean that members in different  places

can  elect  representatives from among  themselves  and

then attend the general meeting of representatives?  Or

shall  we  do  something else? So this is a legislative

detail which must be attended to, otherwise there  will

be  a lot of trouble and difficulties. I wish that  the

Minister for Education can clarify the true position.

inception,  has  had  a  lot  of  problems   over   the

be  now adjourned under Standing Order 24 (1) . This  is

not  any  curtailment of discussion but is, as  I  have

be  set down for oral answer on 12th December, 1966, if

Members  who asked them give notice to Mr  Speaker  by

the 8th December, 1966, that they so desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that earlier

today the Member for Choa Chu Kang was anxious to  have

oral   answers  to  his  questions  which  were  mainly

directed  at my Ministry, and several of the  questions

directed  at  my  Ministry were not answered  today.  I

somehow  feel  that Members of the House, judging  from

today's happenings, are rather anxious to have  many  a

supplementary  question. So with that  in  mind,  I  am

moving the motion.

<div align="center"><b>CULTURE IN SINGAPORE'S NATION-BUILDING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

after  attainment of independence, Singapore  has  made

impressive and smooth progress in various fields,  such

as  internal administration, foreign affairs,  defence,

economy,  labour,  education, culture,  health,  social

affairs,  industrial construction and trade  expansion.

To  the  two  million  people  of  Singapore,  this  is

undoubtedly  a  great  achievement  to  be  proud   of.

Recently,  however, in the field of cultural activities

which  are so very essential to the spiritual  life  of

our  people,  some symptoms of decadence seem  to  have

appeared.  By  cultural  activities,  I  refer  to  the

cinemas,  the  night-clubs, the dance  troupes,  books,

newspapers  and magazines, chain-picture  story  books,

and  the  programmes broadcast over the radio and  T.V.

The problems I want to deliberate on today concern some

unhealthy  tendencies  in the above-mentioned  cultural

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, culture and art constitute an

integral part of the spiritual life of the human being,

whose  four  necessities  of material  life  are  food,

clothing,  shelter and travel. Cultural life  exerts  a

great  influence on mankind as a whole. A good  culture

will  not  only substantiate their spiritual  life  but

will  also  help foster a good and wholesome character.

It will also spark off their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



wisdom and thinking, quite apart from stimulating their

will  and  spirit to move upwards and towards  goodness

and  nobility. This is the kind of good culture  needed

by our newly emergent independent Republic.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It being 8.00 p.m., the Motion for the Adjournment of

Parliament lapsed without Question put.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the House do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.





<div align="center"><h4>CULTURE IN SINGAPORE'S NATION-BUILDING</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you very

much, Mr Speaker, I shall continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, bad culture will paralyse the

human  mind,  make  a  person pessimistic,  despondent,

torpid,  and  lead him to decadence and  even  ultimate

destruction. This is the kind of bad culture  which  we

must discard by all means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad culture I have mentioned refers to films,

books,   newspapers   and   magazines   which   contain

licentious, indecent, corrupting, fantastic and immoral

material. In the national language this kind of culture

is  described as Kebudayaan Chabul. This expression has

a   profound   significance  which   connotes   incest,

promiscuity, immorality, the infringement of the proper

code  of  conduct,  sensual,  adulterous  and  criminal

behaviour.  In  Singapore at the present  moment,  what

aspects of this bad culture have we? Let me give you  a

few  examples.  Our  cinemas  are  still  flooded  with

pictures depicting fantasy, monstrosity, shameless sex,

murders,  brigandism, hooliganism, and James  Bond-ism.

Rare indeed are there occasions when one is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



treated  to film shows with good themes of an educative

and meaningful nature. What educative effect will films

of this undesirable nature have on our people? What bad

influence  will they exert on our youthful  generation?

In the world of night clubs, Rock-n-Roll and A-Go-Go is

the  rule, and in the dance troupes, excessive exposure

of  a  sexy  nature is the centre of interest  used  to

attract  an  audience. What undesirable influence  will

this  kind  of culture have on our younger  generation?

Apart  from  this, they learn nothing but  the  art  of

jumping-jack and flirting and petting in their  crudest

forms. The streets of Singapore are flooded with chain-picture  story  books (Chinese comics) about  monsters,

goblins,   and  fantasies,  in  spite  of  the   action

Government  took  last  month  to  ban  the  sale   and

circulation  of  such  publications  by  44  publishing

houses  in Hongkong. Extensive damage is being done  to

our  school children, causing them to procrastinate  in

their  studies  and to dream of becoming flying  heroes

like Batman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fields of radio and T.V. broadcasting, apart

from   programmes  on  political  talks,  forums,   and

traditional dramas which are commendable, our radio and

T.V, stations have hardly been able to offer  anything

new and meaningful. The films shown on T.V., except for

a  small number of good educational ones which are very

few  and  far between, are mostly of a farcical nature.

If  we  allow this kind of situation to develop in  its

own course, it will inevitably lead to the emergence of

some   serious   social  problem.  It  is,   therefore,

necessary  to review the position with the utmost  care

and attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good and healthy culture which I have been

talking  about refers to those movies, radio  and  T.V.

programmes,   books  and  publications,   etc.,   whose

contents  are  such  as to extol  virtues  and  condemn

vices,   to   cultivate  an  excellent  character,   to

enlighten  and  educate people to  be  noble  in  their

thought, to nurture and to bring about a keen sense  of

morality  among  the people, and to encourage  them  to

strive for goodness and progress. At the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



juncture, culture should serve the purpose of fostering

the  growth  of  national consciousness,  the  idea  of

loving one's country and a spirit of patriotism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said earlier on that all unhealthy culture, be

it  in  the  form  of  film shows,  books,  newspapers,

magazines or chain-picture books, will definitely exert

an  undesirable  effect on our people,  especially  our

younger generation who will suffer even more harm, for,

being  young people, they are not quite mature in their

thinking,  are  easily subjected to  the  influence  of

yellow culture which will corrupt their thought -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, could you please speak a

little slower? The interpreters are having difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If I were to speak

slowly, would I be restricted with regard to time?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You are obviously speaking too fast.

Could  you  speak a little slowly and more  distinctly,

please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make them despondent, daydream and go astray;

worse,  make  them commit criminal acts. Many  criminal

acts  that  are  taking  place  in  society,  such   as

fighting, robbery, theft, raping, etc., are mostly done

by young people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get down to the cause of all this, yellow films

and  publications are mostly to blame.  Last  month,  a

robbery took place in the Department of Social Welfare.

The  robbers  first handed a letter to the  victim.  On

opening  the  letter,  it was found  to  contain  these

words,  "This  is  a hold-up." Is not such  a  dramatic

robbery  learnt  from  and modelled  on  the  style  of

Western  films  depicting robbery? The harm  caused  by

these  unhealthy  films  is,  therefore,  not  a  small

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, of course, it has been the

consistent  policy of our Government in  the  field  of

culture  to  uphold and promote the excellent  cultural

traditions of the various races and to curb all  yellow

culture. Hence, after our Party was voted into power to

form the Government of self-governing Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



we   immediately   launched  an   anti-yellow   culture

campaign.  Measures  were  taken  to  ban  pornographic

publications, close down massage parlours, and impose a

more  stringent film censorship. On the other hand,  we

have  actively promoted a campaign for healthy culture,

such  as  the holding of Aneka Ragam Rakyat in  various

constituencies which will help promote the  interchange

and flow of the cultures and arts of the various races,

playwriting  contests,  the building  of  the  National

Theatre,  the holding of the South-East Asian  Cultural

Festival  and other activities. As a result,  there  is

manifest in our country a lively, flourishing,  healthy

culture.  Meanwhile, with the active  encouragement  of

the  Ministry of Culture, various artist bodies of  our

community  have also been very active in  recent  years

and  our  painters have also held many  exhibitions  of

works  with  realistic  themes. Therefore,  except  for

those   obnoxious  phenomena  I  have  mentioned,   the

cultural activities in our Republic are, by and  large,

developing towards the better side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how strict and stringent the Government

may  have  been  in its measures, the  sex-mongers  are

still  able  to  have their way in  carrying  on  their

nefarious activities. This is particularly so when  the

authorities  concerned  become lax,  thus  facilitating

such  yellow  culture to invade our country,  spreading

its evil effects, and continuing to poison the minds of

our  younger generation. For instance, only last  month

44  chain-picture  story book publishers  in  Hong-Kong

were   banned   from  selling  their  publications   in

Singapore,  but such publications had already  been  in

circulation  here  for more than one year  before  they

were  found out and banned. I think it is necessary  to

find  out  why such phantom comics had been allowed  in

Singapore  for  one  year  before  they  were   banned.

Obviously   this  is  ascribable  to  the  laxity   and

negligence on the part of the censoring authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I would like to point out another

aspect of the matter which is rather serious. There are

huge  cinema posters displayed at prominent  places  on

the  roadside  and  advertisements put  up  by  dancing

troupes in the newspapers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



They  all  depict  sex  and love-making  and  excessive

exposure. Similarly, advertisements by the cinemas  and

dance  troupes appearing in the newspapers also contain

pictures  of excessive sensual exposure. It is  obvious

that  posters  and  advertisements  of  such  obscenity

should  not  be  allowed to be publicly displayed,  for

they  will give rise to a chain of dangerous reactions,

daydreaming, culminating in fatal traffic accidents and

other mishaps. But what puzzles me is that, in spite of

the  fact  that my colleague, comrade Chan Choy  Siong,

the  Member  for  Delta, raised this question  in  this

House  last  year and made criticisms of these  obscene

advertisements, so far no measures have been  taken  by

the department concerned to curb such advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr Speaker, by enumerating those

phenomena  of unhealthy culture, I do not mean  to  say

that yellow and unhealthy culture is out of all control

in  our  country.  No.  In  fact,  it  is  still  under

effective  control. But while we are in the  course  of

nation-building and bringing up a fine generation after

us, while the country is engaged in the setting up of a

disciplined  society, and while our Prime Minister  has

again and again stressed the need actively to bring  up

a  new  generation with learning, scientific knowledge,

strength  and courage, we should prevent such poisonous

culture  from continuing its inroads into our  country,

bringing  in  its train harmful effects on our  younger

generation.  Therefore, we should take early  steps  to

prevent and wipe out the spread of such yellow culture,

because  it is against our aim and endeavour to nurture

and  bring up a fine new generation. If we tolerate its

existence, it may even wipe out all our efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly a fine and healthy

culture  will  bring up and imbue a  people  with  fine

thinking and character. On the contrary, a bad  culture

will  make  a people decadent in thought and lethargic.

Therefore,  cultural construction is very important  to

the  cultivation of character in the people and to  the

great task of nation-building.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



The renaissance of Europe in about  the  14th

century  is  a good example. In a multi-racial  society

such as ours, we must, first and foremost, develop  and

give   expression  to  the  inherent  fine  traditional

cultures of the various races. Of course, I do not mean

to  do  away with all Western culture or to impose  the

culture  of one race upon the other races, as  this  is

absolutely  impracticable. In fact, being  situated  at

the  hub of South-East Asia and the cross-roads of Asia

and  Europe, Singapore cannot entirely escape from  the

influence of foreign culture. Even so, in order to look

after the interest of our people, we still have to curb

any   foreign  culture  which  has  excessive  poisons.

Secondly,  as  an  emergent  independent  Republic,  we

should  create  and  enrich our own  fine  culture.  Of

course,  our  cultural mission should aim at  the  dual

objectives  of  enriching the healthy and  recreational

life of our people and helping in the promotion of  the

task  of  nation-building. How to achieve  these  ideal

aims?  I  feel  it  lies in the  joint  effort  of  our

Government and the art circles. If pioneers and workers

in  our  art circles will exert themselves,  they  will

definitely  be able to promote and enrich the  cultural

life of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally, on the question of

cultural  construction, I would like to offer  my  ten-point suggestions for the Minister's reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A complete set of cultural policy be formulated

to  serve as guidance to all future cultural activities

of the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A Cultural Consultative Committee be formed,

comprising   representatives  from  the   Ministry   of

Culture,  educational,  arts, cultural,  religious  and

journalistic circles and the N.T.U.C. to put forward to

the   Minister   now   and  then  views   on   cultural

construction.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I want to assist the Member to make the

best use of his time. At 8.20 p.m., if any other Member

wants  to speak, the Member for Sembawang will have  to

stop and the Minister may want an opportunity to reply.

So  the  Member  has got about two and a  half  minutes

left,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): (3) A National

Film Studio be set up to take movie films of all

national construction, and, where possible, to take one

or two movies on a larger scale with contents rich in

national consciousness and educational value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A National Academy of Arts, to study the way to

develop  our culture and arts and further to study  the

arts  and  cultures  of South-East Asian  countries  in

order to enrich our cultural heritage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A large-scale cultural festival be held annually,

to  afford  an opportunity for comparison  and  mutual

emulation  between the fine cultures  of  the  various

races,  so  as  to  enrich the cultural  life  of  the

people  and  further  promote  progress  in  arts  and

culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) A large-scale anti-yellow campaign be held

annually,  to  be promoted jointly and  in  mutual  co-operation  with  the  People's  Association  and  civic

organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Stricter measures be taken in the censorship of

photographs,  books, newspapers and magazines  and  all

corrupting,   unethical   and   immoral    films    and

publications to be banned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Stricter restrictions be taken in regard to

cinema  posters on hoardings on the roadsides and  film

and   dance-troupe  advertisements  appearing  in   the

newspapers, publicity of excessively sexy and  indecent

exposure to be banned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Radio and television stations be stopped from

broadcasting   any  sexual,  monstrous,   immoral   and

farcical programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) More programmes of healthy and educational

content  and  significance be broadcast  by  radio  and

television stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with this, I conclude my speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Khoon Choy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b> rose and then resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Minister can make a short

reply,  and  if  he  will restrict  it  to  about  five

minutes, there will be five minutes left,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Minister of State for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, my reply will be more than ten

minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Under Standing Orders, I am afraid the

House must rise at half-past eight, unless the Minister

wants to make use of some other occasion to give a full

reply. As we will be having many sittings in the course

of  the  later part of the month, perhaps Inche Rahamat

can  address the House and the Minister can  find  some

other opportunity to reply to both Members.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  I  wish  to speak on  how  our  national

culture  has deteriorated with the mixture  of  Western

culture  and  dances, for instance,  the  Shindig,  the

Shake  and the A-Go-Go. But I can conveniently describe

them  as  mad  dances. Such dances  have  affected  our

younger generation. They have become daydreamers.  They

have  completely  neglected their  obligations  towards

society. They have become immoral as a result of  these

mad  dances. They keep their hair long and  wear  tight

trousers  - this also applies to the girls -  with  the

result  that we cannot make out who are the  girls  and

who  are  the boys! Some of them are still  at  school.

With  the  spread  of  such dances  we  fear  that  the

behaviour  and  conduct of our youths will  damage  our

local  customs  which are respected by  other  nations.

These   youths   will  neglect  their  responsibilities

towards  the  nation and society. Is the  Minister  for

Culture prepared to condone such a state of affairs, or

is  it  the  intention  to make  such  mad  dances  our

national  item?  I  cannot forget  that  in  1959,  the

Government  banned the Rock-n-Roll and the juke  boxes,

which  at  that  time were the craze of both  boys  and

girls,  to  such  an extent that they  neglected  their

education  and damage was done to their character.  But

these  mad  dances are worse than Rock-n-Roll.  Is  the

Minister for Culture aware that Television Singapura is

encouraging  such  dances  through  the  Istana   Pesta

programme? The indications of this programme  are  that

our  children  are under the influence of  such  yellow

culture. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



hope  the  Minister for Culture of Singapore will  take

steps  to  ban such dances so that our local traditions

will be respected.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, you have to compress what you

have to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it is

difficult  to reply in 5 minutes to the matters  raised

by  the  Members,  who  took 25 minutes.  But  I  shall

endeavour to do my best. If I have longer time I  shall

give a more detailed reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Mr Speaker, the two Members have spoken

generally on the so-called yellow culture prevalent  in

Singapore.  The  Member  for Sembawang  spent  some  20

minutes  on  this matter. But to sum up his  speech  he

appeals to the Government to take action to prevent the

flood  of  yellow culture in Singapore,  to  take  more

restrictive  measures against pornographic publications

and  films,  and to take positive steps  to  promote  a

healthy cultural growth. In principle, Mr Speaker, the

Government  has  since  1959  been  implementing   this

policy.  As a matter of fact, the Member for  Sembawang

himself  has  admitted, by the examples given  by  him,

that  the situation is not so bad. He says that  yellow

culture  is  not so rampant as to be beyond redemption.

So,  strictly speaking, the so-called unhealthy culture

is  still under effective control. That is what he says

on his own admission. This is a fact, of course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before giving a point-by-point reply to

the two Members, I shall let the House know briefly our

national  policy on culture. It is dependent  upon  the

political  system and the economic environment  of  the

nation.  It  is  determined  by  the  economy  and  the

politics  of the country. In Communist countries  where

the  national power is unlimited, even, as  the  Member

for Geylang Serai has said, if your hair is too long or

your  shoes are not where they should be, or the hairdo

of the women is considered improper, the nation has the

power to interfere with your personal life and describe

you as elements of yellow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



culture and even brand you as anti-nationals. In short,

in a Communist dictatorship, the State has the power to

interfere  with  the  way of life  of  each  and  every

individual  in  the country. But in the environment  in

which we live, which is a democratic country practising

parliamentary  democracy,  we  do  not   advocate   the

unlimited   power  of  the  State.  We   have   certain

limitations  to  the  power of the  State.  Apart  from

looking  after the necessities of the people,  such  as

education,  health, food and shelter, and security,  we

allow  and  respect  certain individual  freedom  of  a

personal  nature.  Also, to judge others'  standard  of

culture  by your own standard, and to impose  your  own

standard  upon  others,  is  against  the  spirit   and

principle of democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate this point. An African ballet troupe

came  to Singapore some time ago. Some members  of  the

troupe  were  half-naked. If the Member  for  Sembawang

were to see the show, he would not be able to sleep the

whole night! But, generally speaking, from the artistic

and  aesthetic  point of view, such half-nakedness  was

not  provocative. It had an artistic effect.  Even  the

folk  dance  of  Egypt, the belly  dance,  which  is  a

traditional dance, may be considered by some foreigners

to  be  yellow culture. But in a democracy we must  not

adopt the views of a few Members and impose them on the

people  of  Singapore in general and restrict  them  in

their cultural activities. We will not force people  to

cut  their hair short, because, by so doing we will  be

acting against democratic principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the promotion of a healthy culture, I

shall  take  this  opportunity to say that  ever  since

1959, when we initiated the Aneka Ragam Rakyat, we have

also taken steps to establish a council which plans  to

launch  a purely local-orientated cultural festival  to

display  the work of our artists in Singapore. We  want

our  artists and other experts to study and  to  create

new  art forms in Singapore and we shall launch  a  new

art  festival next year. In the field of drama we shall

encourage  our  playwrights to write  works  reflecting

local life for our radio and television. Perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



this  is  what the Member for Sembawang would  like  to

have,  but  some  matters would not be  to  his  taste.

Because  of the limitation of time, I shall under  more

favourable  conditions give a more detailed  answer  to

his speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at 8.00 p.m. and

the  Debate  having  continued for half  an  hour,  Mr

Speaker  adjourned  the  House  without  Question  put,

pursuant to the Standing Order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question for Oral Answer stood on the

Order Paper of 5th December, 1966:



<br><br><div align="center"><b> Land allocation for Malay Settlement at Ayer Gemuroh</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>22.  "Mr  Sim Boon Woo:</b> To ask the Minister  for  Law

and National Development what progress has been made in

regard to the allocation of land for a Malay settlement

at Ayer Gemuroh and when allocation will be made to the

290 applicants."





<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker(Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant  to Standing Order No. 20 (2) ,  the  Minister

for Law and National Development supplied the following

answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. "No allocation of land in the Malay settlement at

Ayer  Gemuroh has been made since 1959. The Government,

taking  cognizance of the acute shortage of  land,  has

decided  that  the  policy  regarding  such  settlement

should   be  reviewed  in  the  light  of  our  rapidly

increasing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ayer Gemuroh for instance, some 82 acres of land

were  set  aside  for  a Malay settlement.  This  land,

however, was not completely vacant as at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



time of gazetting in March 1959 there were already  190

Malay,  16 Chinese and 5 Indian families living on  it.

In  the  same year, 8 new families moved into the  area

and  were  allocated  one lot each.  Hence,  though  in

theory it would appear that there were many lots  which

still  remain to be allocated, in actual fact not  much

land  is available for allocation at the site. Further,

some  parts  of this land are low lying and subject  to

floods, and to make these parts suitable for habitation

will  require considerable expenditure of public  funds

towards  earthworks and the construction of a  sea-wall

as  well  as  the provision of roads, drainage,  water,

electricity   and  other  facilities.   The   cost   of

earthworks alone has been estimated at $40,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the heavy expenditure required to settle a

few   more   families  in  this  area,  the  Government

considers that alternative means may have to  be  found

to  solve the housing problem of the applicants, as  it

is  evident that the advantages to be gained  from  the

expenditure of funds at Ayer Gemuroh will be very  much

less  than  if  the same sum of money  is  spent  on  a

planned housing estate."
