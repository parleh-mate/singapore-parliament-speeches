<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>"COURTESY AND SERVICE"</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COURSES FOR HOSPITAL STAFF</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs C. V. Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs C. V. Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister for Health whether

he will consider holding "Courtesy and Service" courses for

members of hospital staff to improve their relations with the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government

places great importance in improving courtesy and service to the

public by its Government servants. At the end of 1960, a

Committee consisting of ministerial and departmental

representatives drew up a blue-print for improvements in the

relationship between the Government and the public. `This was

followed by an intensive campaign in each Ministry to improve en

courtesy and service. Courtesy officers were appointed in each

section of the Ministry. Staff were briefed on the importance of

courtesy. Talks were given to staff dealing with the public, such

as telephone operators, medical and health servants, nurses and

doctors. The co-operation of the unions was also sought in these

efforts. In addition, the Central Complaints Bureau was

established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal courtesy and service courses are not at present being

conducted for hospital staff, and I do not think it necessary to

conduct courtesy and service courses as suggested by the hon.

Member for Moulmein, because adequate measures have already been

taken to ensure that all staff are expected to show maximum

possible courtesy and civility to the public. Nurses are being

taught ethics in their training courses, and medical health

servants are briefed on the importance of courtesy and service on

appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, under the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings - Delegation of Functions) Regulations, 1962, published in the

Government Gazette Supplement No. 139 dated 20th July, 1962,

Regulation 4 provides, inter alia, that any officer found guilty

of being rude to (the public in speech: or being discourteous to

the public in manner, shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



be liable to be punished under regulations 6, 7 and 8 thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending upon the gravity of the offence, the latter

regulations provide:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that such officer be severely reprimanded and a record made

of the reprimand in his Record of Service; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) . . . forfeiture of not more than one-half of such officer's

basic monthly salary or by a fine of two hundred dollars

whichever is the less; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) stoppage or deferment of any increment of salary; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) discontinuance of his further service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Will the Minister concerned tell

this House whether there is any Complaints Bureau accessible to

patients to make complaints to the officers in the hospital about

their grievances?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the hon.

Member for Bras Basah that there is already in existence a

Central Complaints Bureau, and all that a member of the public

need do is to write a letter direct to me and it will be

investigated.

<div align="center"><b>RENT INCREASE BY LANDLORDS ON BUILDINGS BUILT AFTER 1947</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs C. V. Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs C. V. Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs whether he will take measures to prevent landlords from

increasing rents on buildings built after 1947 which do not come

within the provisions of the Rent Control Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to

extend the provisions of the Rent Control Ordinance to cover new

buildings may well discourage private building and development

which the Government wishes to encourage. The solution lies in

increasing the availability of accommodation.

<div align="center"><b>REPAIRS AND REWIRING OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PREMISES BY LANDLORDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs C. V. Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mrs C. V. Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs whether he will consider introducing amending legislation

to provide for repairs and rewiring of premises to be effected by

landlords.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

obligation on the part of a landlord to carry out repairs and

rewiring of premises is governed by the terms of the contract of

lease or tenancy between the landlord and the tenant. In the

absence of an express clause, the landlord should undertake major

repairs and the tenant minor repairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will look into the matter in order to ascertain

whether such legislation is feasible or practical.

<div align="center"><b>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOR 1965</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [1st

Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates of Expenditure of the State of

Singapore for the year 1965, as contained in Paper Cmd. 24 of

1964. For the convenience of hon. Members, I intend taking the

total for each head of expenditure as it appears in the last

column of the abstract of estimated expenditure on page 39 of the

Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing now with the heads of expenditure in respect of

which amendments stand on the Order Paper Supplement :-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



Head 0103 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0103 be reduced by the

whole sum in respect of subhead 3002.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is on the production of the Legislative Assembly

Hansards. We find that the vote provided for next year has been

reduced to a great extent, namely, from $33,780 to $22,000. It

seems to me that every year the vote provided for the production

of the Legislative Assembly Hansards has been reduced .1 would

like to ask the Minister responsible whether he can give any

explanation on this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, the reduction in

the provision made for the production of the Assembly Hansards is

in anticipation that there will not be so many night sittings of

this Assembly to warrant overtime payments. In 1961 there were 41

Assembly sittings; 34 in 1962 and 32 in 1963. The provision of

$22,000 for 1965 is estimated to cover overtime payments and

remuneration for about 30 sittings.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish to withdraw his

amendment, or does he want the House to vote on it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> I withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $686,070 for Head 0103 ordered to stand part of

the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0104 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0104 be reduced

by $100.+



<hr size="2" noshade>

+The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we find that under this head there are several items of

expenditure concerned with students in higher institutions of

learning, for example, items of expenditure relating to

bursaries, scholarships and allowances. The Government has

announced that it will provide bursaries and financial assistance

to poor students entering these institutions of higher learning

to help them to continue with their studies. Sir, superficially

these promises sound very nice. But we have found that the

Government has been making use of these bursaries under this Head to

achieve the P.A.P.'s own selfish interest.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that before a bursary is issued, all students will

have to apply for it, and the Government will have to carry out

an investigation which will take a long period of time. Of

course, in the course of investigation, political factors will be

involved. Perhaps certain students not liked by the Government

will not be able to get the bursaries. But even after getting the

bursaries, these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



may be cancelled. There is a recent case of a particular

student's bursary being cancelled. The Government has also

cancelled the bursaries of quite a good number of Nantah students

whose conduct and academic merits have been very good. These

students have not been found to be deficient in their studies;

nor has there been any blemish on their character. So the

abolition of their bursaries can be attributed to the Govern

ment's political prejudices. Such actions by the Government

undoubtedly can be construed as extorting funds from the public

and misusing them. We know that in the past, the Government tried

to split the student bodies in the universities. Bursaries were

also used as a means to achieve that purpose. For instance, the

Government could resort to getting the help of the P.A.P.

elements in the institutions to propagate the line that if the

students did not vote for their man, the P.A.P. man, then their

bursaries would be cancelled. Such things did happen before in

the past. This has happened in Nanyang University and also in the

University of Singapore. Therefore, we say that the true

intention of the Government is to misuse public funds to carry

out its open corruption. I will also raise another matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During August to September this year, the Public Service

Commission wrote to the Ministry of Education in Japan to cancel

the bursary of a student who was the Chairman of the Malayan

Students Committee in Japan. Chua Swee Lin was the person who got

a Japanese scholarship amounting to $200 Malayan money per month

in 1962 to learn ship-building. Because the students' union there

expressed their dissatisfaction with Malaysia, the Government

therefore took suppressive action against the student there, and

tried to resort to the cancellation of the bursary through the

Japanese Government to achieve its purpose. Such action by the

Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member should confine

himself, while he is on this particular item, to matters which

are within the power of the Public Service Commission. It may

well be that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



the recall of the student is not within the powers of the Public

Service Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this

action of the Government has been carried out through the Public

Service Commission. It was the Public Service Commission that

wrote to the Japanese Government to cancel the bursary of this

particular student. That is why I have mentioned this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to talk about certain matters relating to

Government departments. If graduates want to join the Government

service so that they can teach, they have to go through a

selection procedure by way of interview by the Public Service

Commission. Many teachers in aided secondary schools applied to

the Public Service Commission for confirmation of their jobs

after a period of time, and they had their applications refused.

In other words, their applications to continue to teach in the

schools were refused. I understand that many of these graduate

teachers were not taken to be incapable or inefficient in their

teaching. The fact is that the Public Service Commission, during

their investigations, received certain information from the

Special Branch. I would like to ask, where is the value of the

Public Service Commission if they have to listen to and be

subjected to interference from the Special Branch? If that is the

case, then let the Special Branch take over their functions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jurong

began with some very nasty allegations that scholar-ships are

awarded on the basis of political patronage and political

chicanery. But he ended on a more realistic note. I reject both

the scurrilous allegations that the P.S.C. in fact carries out

the instructions of the Special Branch, and, therefore, it is

best that the Special Branch were to substitute itself for the

P.S.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these scholarships now appearing under the Head of

Public Service Commission is to centralise and co-ordinate the

award of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



scholarships in such a way as to meet the requirements of the

State; the Finance Ministry, the Economic Development Division,

the Education Ministry. Awards are given to persons on the basis

of merit, not whether they are pro or against any political

Party. But where a person is deemed a security risk to the State,

where his political beliefs are of such a nature as to constitute

a risk, then it is not the business of the State to give money to

such people in order to help them undermine the State. But these

policies are interpreted very liberally. Let me explain that the

Member for Tampines was in receipt of a bursary under the P.A.P.

Government whilst he was at the University of Nanyang. We are

fairly wide and flexible. We do not want to make a man more

embittered and more frustrated with society than he need be. If

he has youthful inclinations towards extreme political views,

well, by all means, let him go through that phase; let him

mature. But when we know a man is already committed to the

destruction of the democratic State, it is not our business to

spend money on him to equip him to carry out his purposes better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, this problem will arise on less

and less occasions in the future, because, as the Member now

knows, there is the Internal Security Act which makes it

necessary for a student to be security cleared first before he is

admitted to a university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other allegation that the Public Service

Commission wrote to the Japanese Government to cancel a

scholarship given to a particular student, that is not within my

knowledge. I do not think the Public Service Commission did any

such thing. It is not in a position to communicate with any

foreign Government. The only Ministry which now communicates with

foreign Governments is the External Affairs Ministry in Kuala

Lumpur. I do not even know whether it did or not. I should not

assume, as the Member for Jurong did, that one student is so very

important as to warrant the intervention of the External Affairs

Ministry. I should not be the least bit surprised that the

student brought it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



upon himself by his foolish activities in Japan which came to the

notice of the Japanese Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the selection of officers by the P.S.C. for

appointments into the administrative or the education service.

Here again, as I have said, it is not the business of the

Government to appoint people either into the administrative or

the educational service to breed more disaffection and

disloyalty, not to a particular political Party or to a parti

cular government of Singapore, but to the whole institution of

the State, to the whole concept of the democratic State. Here

again it is a policy which has to be implemented with a great

deal of sensitivity. One of the points the Public Service

Commission must consider is the security risk a particular person

may carry with him into the administration; information which

comes from the Intelligence organs of the Government, now the

Central Government.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to weigh whether a man is really committed, or it is not

better to give him a chance and a way out, to let him find

fulfilment in fruitful, constructive work, than to throw that

away out of sheer frustration and bitterness. It is a fine

balance. We do not want to make more people look more haggard,

more hard, and more bitter day by day, as the Member for Jurong

and his colleagues do. Over the last one year, trouble upon

trouble has fallen upon his shoulders - very youthful shoulders,

Mr Speaker, Sir. First, it was the Member for Bukit Merah who

was leading the charge of the light brigade (a very light brigade

this one). The Member for Bukit Merah, being a much more cir

cumspect, equable type, decided that this was a mug's game, if I

may say so, and has opted out from the leadership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Mr Speaker, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I doubt if the remarks made by the Prime

Minister have any relevance to this issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Prime Minister will come back to the

amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I know it hurts, Mr Speaker, Sir.

But the point I want to make is this: we do not want to have more

bitter people in this world. If we can give them jobs, give them

scholarships, and give them fulfilment, we will. But when we know

that the man is so embittered as to bring the State down, then I

say it is the business of the P.S.C.

and let me inform the Member for Jurong that usually the P.S.C.

takes a lenient view and gives the man a chance. But when he

turns out to be a security risk, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, on

my advice, intervenes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are foolish in the implementation of these

scholarships, and giving of jobs, and if we are insensitive and

crude, we drive more people to bitterness and to opposition. That

is not our job, that is not our intention, and that is not in our

interests. We want to give all those who desire to contribute to

the welfare and well-being of our country an opportunity to play

their role. It is not too late even for Members on the other side

to rethink their positions in these very changed circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have been listening carefully to the Prime Minister's

reply to the query raised by my colleague.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the administration of bursaries and

scholarships which he relates closely to the security risk of a

certain student, I have this doubt, Mr Speaker. What is the

criterion by which students may be judged with regard to the

so-called security risk?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question also arises: those students receiving bursaries

who refuse to become tools of the P.A.P., or who refuse to be

made use of by the P.A.P., or who do not endorse the policies of

the P.A.P. - are they to be regarded as security risks?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, I could have saved

a lot of trouble if I had explained further. These security objections are

not objections taken by the Government. It is done by a proper

Intelligence agency. It is now, in fact, not a State Government

responsibility. Security Intelligence is placed before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



P.S.C. in the making of appointments or in the dispensation of

scholarships, it has nothing to do with political party

affiliations. I think the Member may be under some

misapprehension that it is either because the man is pro-P.A.P.,

or pro-Alliance, or pro-Barisan. That has got nothing to do with

it, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like

to say this, that Singapore is still under colonial rule or

neo-colonial rule. Take, for example, a student of Nantah or the

Singapore University or the Singapore Polytechnic, if he is

against imperialism, i.e. if he is against the British masters,

then will the P.S.C. refuse to give him a bursary or a

scholarship? We can give several interpretations of his

behaviour. Those who are in actual control have absolute power at

any time over all the departments under their control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise one other point with regard to

bursaries. The administration of bursaries is not aimed at

fostering talent in our country. Why should I say this? I say

this because I have come across some highly talented students who

have been denied the opportunity of having bursaries or scholar

ships. Furthermore, because of their family circumstances, these

highly talented students cannot afford to go for further studies.

I would have thought that bursaries would have been awarded

purely on the basis of academic standards and financial

difficulties of the students. But the Government is not helping

these people who deserve bursaries. As far as I know, the

P.A.P.'s idea is to give bursaries to some students who are not

so highly talented and who are not so poorly off. I, in the

Opposition, have the responsibility to express the view that the

Government should be urged to note the facts that I have

raised - that the allocation of bursaries should not be based purely on

security grounds alone, because this should not be the case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member

for Jalan Kayu can give me any specific instance where he thinks an award

of a scholarship or a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



bursary has been granted not in accordance with merit and need, I

shall certainly have the matter investigated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell him that there .are two forms of

scholarships and bursaries. One is on the basis of competitive

merit, regardless of the financial circumstances of the family;

competitive merit and performance entitles the student to a

scholarship. The other comes under the classification of bur

saries and other assistance. This is related to the question of

need - first, that the student is worth assisting; and second,

that the student is in need of assistance. If the Member will

supply me with any information - as he says he has knowledge of

irregularity or improper award - I shall have the matter properly

investigated. And I am quite prepared to place the result of any

such investigation into his complaint before this House, or

otherwise make it public. I think it is important that in the

process of wanting to score political points, one should not

spread a big smear that scholarships, appointments to the State,

the whole works is just one bag of tricks meant to patronise

friends, supporters, carpet-baggers. If the State is to survive,

it must stand strict scrutiny. If the democratic system of one

man one vote and open criticism is to survive, it must withstand

criticism such as has been made in a veiled and vague manner by

the Member for Jurong and the Member for Jalan Kayu. I say: make

your specific charges, list them, and we will investigate them

and place the results before this Assembly. But I say this, that

first we accept the position that nobody is entitled as of right

to ask, if the State helps him, to dismantle the democratic

system. That is not the purpose of this Government or the P.S.C.

or any of the other institutions of state.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Prime

Minister has said just now that the information was from an

Intelligence source. I -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. I do not want

to be misquoted. I have never said "informers" (ching pao jen). What I

said was "security



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



assessment by the Special Branch". We do not have any informers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, so let it be

Intelligence investigation. The so-called Intelligence

investigation should be revealed in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to talk about bursaries. At the present moment, the

payment of bursaries in the State is intended to help poor

students to pursue higher education. But this aid does not exist

any more because the payment of bursaries has become a tool of

the P.A.P. The administration of bursaries is virtually under the

control of the P.A.P. so that the disciples of the P.A.P. and

their supporters may be gathered together to help them during the

elections and to contribute to the Party funds. If you want to

get this bursary, then you must toe the line of the P.A.P. This

is the present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says that these bursaries are not given casually

but are given according to certain rules, and to the financial

circumstances of the applicants. If this is so, then it

is strange that when an undergraduate, who is considered poor and

receives a bursary for the first, second and third years, and in

the fourth year - when he is still poor - he is all of a sudden

recalled. Does it mean that all of a sudden his family has become

so well off that he does not deserve any more help? This is

strange. This is done according to the Intelligence given by the

Special Branch which is virtually under the control of the

British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that at the present moment those recipients of

bursaries are under certain restrictions. They run the risk of

having their bursaries withdrawn. If they cannot afford to go on

without bursaries, they have to work part-time in order to carry

on their studies. They cannot enjoy life so comfortably as the

Ministers can. And if the students refuse to be suppressed by the

Government, then they have to work extra hard to earn money to

finance their studies.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is now extensively suppressing the students. In

the past few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



years, we have seen that many students and graduates have been

unable to get jobs from the Government. The Government is not in

any position to give them jobs - particularly to Nanyang

University graduates. I who have been a Nantah student know that

there were many recipients of bursaries, hut now the number has

been reduced in spite of the fact that many of them are deserving

of bursaries. Some graduates who have passed out are unemployed.

So the granting of bursaries is a means by which the Government

tries to oppress tbe Nanyang under-graduates and graduates. Those

who have passed out are unable to get jobs and tbe Government is

not giving them any help; no outlet is provided for them. I who

have been a recipient of some aid from the

Government - [Interruption]. I who have been a recipient of some aid from

the Government, together with other recipients of bursaries, know

that we have not been accepted into the public service. I myself

have not been taken into the Government. On the other hand, we

see that the Deputy Prime Minister is a teacher and a Member of

the Assembly at the same time. The P.S.C. has made a ruling that

teachers of government-aided schools cannot undertake any extra

work. The ruling is that extra-mural activities should be

controlled. This adversely affects the under-graduates because if

they want to do anything outside their studies, they will be

interfered with by the Government: there will be a lot of

restrictions on their behaviour. When they are dissatisfied with

the Government, they run the risk of losing their bursaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations governing the granting of bursaries are

unreasonable. When the under-graduates discover this fact, they

air their grievances before the Minister for Education. Certain

claims are made to revise the existing regulations, but in spite

of repeated requests and discussions, the Government refuses to

revise them. So the students have no alternative but to accept

these stringent regulations. These regulations have been used by

the P.A.P. Government to oppress the undergraduates of Nanyang

University.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. want recipients of bursaries to

give information on others who have acted or said anything

against them. So the P.A.P. are making use of bursaries to help

the Special Branch to oppress students. We oppose the abuse of

such funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Prime Minister has said just now that if we could give him

specific cases of misuse of bursaries by some students, he would

deal with them accordingly. I would like to tell you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that this statement made by the Prime Minister is

an attempt to shirk his responsibility as the head of the

Government. If the whole ruling machinery with a force of thou

sands of civil servants are not aware of this fact, then it is

very sad. The administration of bursaries is not well done. This

is not admitted by the Government and it tries to shirk its

responsibility. It is a fact that public funds have been abused

and misused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say some more on this. I have been given to

understand by my friends who applied for bursaries that during

the interview, questions were fired at them at random and they

were made fun of. One question asked of these students was, "Have

you ever been in love?" [Interruption in Mandarin by the Prime

Minister] You know it too well. If you do not believe it, ask

your informers!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member is talking about the

Prime Minister, he must say, "The Prime Minister knows it too

well."



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we can

imagine how improper it is that bursaries are thus awarded!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a

suggestion to make: every citizen

of Singapore is duty bound to pay taxes and if a person is

against colonial rule or imperialism, tben no matter whether he

is pro-P.A.P. or pro-Barisan, he should be treated in the same

way as the others. There should be equal treatment all round. My

colleague has said that he was the recipient of a bursary, but he

was not taken into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



Government service because of his political

affiliation. But if he had wanted to be as servile as the others,

he would have been taken in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, out of all these

scurrilous charges have come two specific instances - the Member for Tampines

himself when he compared his unfortunate position or his unfavour

able treatment with that of the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already explained why, in spite of his

undesirable political associates, we allowed him a bursary in

Nanyang University. It was the policy of the Government that so

long as a man is redeemable - in his case, I would not write him

off as already lost - he will be given a chance. Unfortunately,

Mr Speaker, Sir, he failed. He had to be referred for an extra

year and ultimately he passed. He now says that we have not given

him a job, unlike the Deputy Prime Minister who is not only in

office as a Minister but is also teaching. Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is quite different. The University is an autonomous body; it is

not a Government institution. The Deputy Prime Minister asked

that he be allowed to continue the direction of scholars whose

research he was supervising and to give his lectures to keep his

knowledge up to date. The Member for Tampines is asking for a

Government appointment and it is against the Constitution for a

Government servant to be a Member of the Assembly or vice versa.

If we allow him to become a member of the public service, we will

be doing him a disservice, because automatically he will be

disqualified from sitting in this Chamber and then he will say

what a lot of wicked people we are for disqualifying him. But let

me tell him this. Any man worth his weight does not have to get a

job in the Government service to make his living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell him this further point, that in a number of

so-called socialist countries, a man who is against the State, who

is against the Russian Government, the Chinese Government or the

Polish Government, not only does not get a scholarship, but he

does not even get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



a place in a University. And worse if he graduates, not only does

he not get a job in the Government, but the Government will see

that he does not get a job at all. Here, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

allow a great deal of latitude. All that we are saying is that a

person who is deemed on security assessment - not on the basis of

just the Government's likes and dislikes - to be a security risk

is not put into a sensitive Government job. But we leave it free

to him to seek other avenues of employment in private enterprise,

a private firm or even to launch into private enterprise, and if

he is any good he will make the grade. But it is not the business

of the Government, having given a man a bursary, he having failed

to make the grade, to give him a job in order that he will be disqualified

from this Assembly. Where is the sense in all this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now

the Prime Minister has made some points in relation to my speech.

I have waited for some time before rising to reply to his speech.

He said that he was not aware of the case of Mr Chua Swee Lin,

but the fact was that the P.S.C. in August wrote a letter to the

Japanese Government to cancel his bursary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Minister for Finance - [Interruption]. Had he been

here, he would not have made such a mistake. He would not have

been so stubborn by saying that this has nothing to do with the

Singapore Government but is the concern of the Ministry of

External Affairs. This shows that the Government has made use of

the granting of bursaries to persecute certain students who do

not hold the same views as the P.A.P. The Government has made use

of bursaries to carry out political patronage. The Prime Minister

gave reasons saying that the Government does not want to deal

with those who are against it but with those who are against the

country and nation. Those who are against the P.A.P. are

classified as those against the democratic system and as

anti-nationals. So in this way he could speak on behalf of democracy.

This is how he wants to evade the criticism



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



levelled at him. I can cite a few examples to prove my

contention. When the P.A.P. Government was going to split certain

student bodies in the University in order to set up another

student club, it had a meeting in the house of the Minister for

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of the Minister for Finance had a meeting with a

party in his house.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Ministerial responsibility. The

activities of my son are not my ministerial responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): After that he asked some of

his friends to carry out sabotage in a certain student body. He

says that his son's behaviour has nothing to do with him. But we

have discovered that bursaries have been made use of to serve a

purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> On a point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The point of order is whether this is

relevant to the issue we are discussing. What has that got to do

with this?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I myself was coming to that. I was just

wondering what the Minister for Finance's son has got to do with

bursaries. Perhaps the Member will confine himself to bursaries

and what arises Out of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Under the circumstances,

certain students have come into contact with another group of

students. If those students join the clique of the Minister for

Finance's son, then they will get scholarships and bursaries.

Another phenomenon is that if a certain person is going to leave a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



certain student body which supports the P.A.P., then his bursary

will be revoked. This is well known in the University. The P.A.P.

say that they will revoke the bursaries of those students who are

against the State and the democratic system. All this is

nonsense. This is mainly to cover up the fact that the P.A.P, are

using bursaries as a means to serve their purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> If the Member for Jurong will

give me the name of any friend of the Minister for Finance's son who has got

a scholarship as a result of being associated with the son, I

will cause investigations to be made and the results tabled

before him in this House. There is no point in making scurrilous

allegations. To begin with, not even the Minister for Finance's

son got a bursary. What more his friends! If we want to give it,

we might as well give it to the Minister for Finance's son to

start with. As for the student in Japan, what I understand from

the Minister for Finance was this. What happened was and as I

have said, I did not have any direct information on this matter;

I had no notice: his information, from recollection, was that the

Japanese Government informed us of the student's activities. This

is a Colombo Plan scholarship, the donor country of which was the

Japanese Government. Whilst the student was there, he got himself

into undesirable activities with a group connected with the

Zengakuren, which is the extreme lunatic fringe Communist type of

Japanese student movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chia, on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Prime Minister has given way. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to ask the Prime Minister

whether he can say explicitly that the Japanese Government wanted to revoke

the scholarship or whether the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



Government wrote to the Japanese Government asking them to revoke

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The activities of this student

cannot be known to the Singapore Government. We do not keep an Intelligence

service in Japan just to look after a few odd Colombo Plan

students there. This information of activities considered

undesirable was sent to us by them. We then stopped the Colombo

Plan scholarship. That is from recollection. If the Member wishes

to press the point, he can table a question and full details will

be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Prime Minister has

persistently talked about anti-democracy and the undermining of

the State. I would like him to tell me, in view of the fact that

I contested the election and my bursary has been withdrawn by the

Government, in what way have I taken part in any activity which

is contrary to the security of the State?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I am sorry that the Member for

Tampines is so innocent and ignorant of the capacity for damage by Members

of this Assembly. Three of his colleagues are still enjoying the

hospitality of His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong's

Government. He himself had the good fortune not to be too closely

inter-related with their activities, and that is why he is still

here. But I can assure him that if he were foolish enough to

believe that just because he is here he is entitled to do all the

foolish things that were done by the others who are not here,

then he would soon find himself in the position where the others

are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to press this point, as I

have it in my note here that for having put himself in a position

where he cannot discharge the conditions of his bursary to serve

the Government by voluntarily making himself a Member of this

Assembly and, therefore, unable to serve the Government as a

Government servant, he can, if we wish, be sued for breach of

contract. We can make him refund the whole sum that has been

expended on him and which enabled him to become a graduate of

Nanyang University, although, mind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



you, he failed on one occasion, I am told. Nevertheless, in the

end, he did pass, and we wish him well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, just now the Prime Minister

has said that if as a civil servant I do not carry out my duties,

then the Government can sue me for the bursary. But I have not been engaged as a

civil servant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has also referred to the case of the Deputy Prime

Minister who he said was in a different position. I would like to ask

why an hon. Member of the Government can, on the one hand, be a Government

Minister and, on the other hand, he can still be teaching in a

Government-aided institution. Why were the bursaries of other students

revoked? Because of doing such things?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Fully as this House is interested in Mr Poh

Ber Liak, from now I think we should stop discussing his case and

come back to the subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the bursaries

are awarded by the Government for the training of talent. This is

a kind of investment. We all know that in order to reap a good

harvest from the investment, we should make a good selection so

that those selected will be put to proper use. The bursaries come

from public money. Other friendly countries have also donated

towards this purpose. Therefore, we must make proper use of the

bursaries to train suitable persons to serve our country in order

to achieve a more just and equal society. As to how to allocate

bursaries and to whom, it is the decision of the Public Service

Commission, so that in the end we may have the services of the

candidates concerned. With regard to the granting of bursaries, I

think it is only right and proper that the criterion should be

the academic and other merits of the applicants concerned. Only

then will they benefit from the bursaries. If there are

inefficient students who failed their examinations, such as the

Member for Tampines, then it will be a waste of money to award

bursaries; and naturally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



they should have their bursaries revoked. On the other hand, we

should pay attention to whether the candidates, politically

speaking, are a risk to the security of our State, because we

cannot use public funds to train political subversives

detrimental to our own State. Therefore, every government will

see to it that those who apply for bursaries arc at least loyal

to the State. We cannot use public funds to train students to

carry out anti-national activities. After we have trained such

students, the knowledge they have acquired and the technique and

the know-how they have attained will not in the end be used by

them to build our nation because they are by nature anti-national

and antisocial. How can they use their knowledge and the know-how

they have acquired to serve their country? Therefore, a

democratic country has the right to protect itself. If there are

students who make use of funds given by the Government to undergo

a course of study and who resort to activities detrimental to the

security of the State, then I feel that the Government has every

right to revoke such bursaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

P.A.P. Members have used the term "bursaries" as a kind of

investment. They have used such-like epithets. Is it their

intention to term the candidates for bursaries as tools or

machinery? Perhaps they want the products of bursaries to be

branded as made by the P.A.P. They claim that the purpose of

awarding bursaries is to train people to serve the country. They

claim that those persons whose bursaries have been cancelled have

been engaged in anti-national activities. But so far, the P.A.P.

have not been able to prove this. If they have the facts, they

should bring up such cases to court, otherwise all the people who

are against the P.A.P. can be construed as being anti-national.

Such a method of smearing people can only prove the dictatorial

nature of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about inefficiency and foolishness in studies: the

Minister for Labour has said how foolish and stupid the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



Member for Tampines was in not being able to get his bursary

continued. Bitt this is a personal question and we should not

pursue it further. I would like to ask whether it is better to be

sycophants or be people who are somewhat foolish. The Members

opposite cannot be compared with my colleagues sitting over here.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I can assure the Member for

Thomson that neither scholarships nor ministerships arc given on the basis of

"patting a horse's hack, side," as he said. Very simply, I put it

to them that if they were running their Communist-type State,

they would not give anybody a scholarship to go and further

sharpen their intellect in order to bring down the Communist

State, would they? They do not do it in China: they do not do it

in Russia; they do not do it in Poland.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Or Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Or even in Indonesia. He who is against

the State cannot expect it to help him to destroy it. As for the

rest - the vague smear - I have said that any charge of nepotism,

favouritism in the award of scholarships or appointments, will be

investigated to the full. There is this one distinction now - the

position as it stands from the position before merger. I mean

before it can be said, "Well, this is a security report, a

security assessment by an organ of the State Government: there

fore there is bias in any way in favour of the P.A.P." It is not

even that way now. The security organ is part of the Central

Government. The security assessment made is part of an assessment

completely unconnected with the likes and dislikes of the P.A.P.

Whether a man is for or against any democratic political Party is

irrelevant. What is relevant is whether it is our job to give

people who are out to destroy the State, money in order to

further themselves to further their objectives. I do not think

anybody in his right mind believes that that is the

responsibility of this Government - giving money to people to

undermine the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Government why there should be a

difference between the estimates for this year and those for next

year. Why is it that there should be a general increase in the

estimates for next year?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not quite follow this. Is the

Member on subhead 1051? His question is why the amount has been

reduced this year. There does not seem to be any figure set out

in the 1964 estimates, Mr Kow Kee Seng. On the face of the

Budget, it would appear as if it is a new post. I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On subhead 1051, I move to

reduce the whole sum.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid that is not proper at this time.

Perhaps if the Member will turn to page 64 of the Estimates, he

will find the sum of $18,240 under Estimates 1964, Director,

Grade G. On page 55, which is the estimates for 1965, the same

figure appears under the same title and the same grading. So it

would appear from these two figures that there has been no

reduction.

same person who has been there as a Grade G officer, who used to

be in the Special Branch and who, previous to being in the

Special Branch, was the Director of the C.P.I.B.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to ask whether

up the Communist united front activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to ask a

supplementary question, that is, whether it is not possible to

find a local officer to fill up this vacancy so that no

expatriate officer has to be engaged. In other words, is there no

available local talent among the existing serving officers who

can do better than the present holder of this post, namely, the

Director of the C.P.I.B.? Does it mean that there is no one who

can do better than this officer for the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, the job of the Director of the

Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau is one which is extremely

sensitive, and the officer brings to this job a wealth of

experience and expertise on quiet investigations. I can inform

the Member for Thomson that quite a number of his comrades have

given me eloquent testimony of the efficiency of this officer,

including Mr James Puthucheary, Mr Sandra Wood-hull and a few

others who are considered heroes of the united front

organisation. I am not suggesting that there are no local

officers more able or less competent to discharge these

responsibilities. The problem now is to get somebody there to

carry on the work; one who brings to this job a wealth of

experience. Unfortunately, this officer's service will end in

1965, and it is my intention, if there are no local officers by

then fully trained to take over this job, to extend his contract.

We have gone over this phase of just chasing the white man out.

He is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



there as our servant to investigate corrupt practices. Our

problem now is to get an adequate number of locally-trained men.

Not able men; ability there is, but trained ability is another

matter. There are several big jobs open - General Manager,

Singapore Harbour Board, Dockyard Manager, General Manager,

P.U.B. These jobs are being occupied at the moment by local men

without the adequate expertise. We are still looking for good men

to fill them up, whether they be expatriate or local.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the Members opposite that if they believe we

are still in the 1956 phase of Malayanisation for the sake of

Malayanisation, they are out of tune with the mood of the public.

There are more than enough big jobs for all locally-qualified

men. The problem is to find enough locally-trained men to fill

the enormous number of big jobs that are now vacant.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I personally feel

that this post held by an expatriate officer is not quite proper.

The Prime Minister says that there are local officers who are as

capable as this officer. If we allow this post to be held by an

expatriate officer - particularly one who has worked for the

British to suppress and exploit our own people - to control this

organisation, and if it is discovered that some of the officers

are corrupted, then this man can make use of his powers as

Director to continue serving the British colonialists. Let us

assume that one Minister in the Cabinet is involved in irregular

activities. Then this Director will make use of this weakness to

turn him into a local agent for the British. This is inevitable,

because the British want their bases to remain in Malaya, and

they may want to make use of some of our people to be their

agents. So I suggest that it would be more proper for a local

officer to hold this post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I would have thought that having

shot the line that the PAP, misuses its governmental powers all

to its own political party advantage,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



here is an expatriate official who is not likely to play

the P.A.P. game and who is not going to charge a man with

corruption just because he happens to be anti-P.A.P., and we are

being exhorted now to put in our own man. Where is the sense or

logic of all this? It is suggested that an expatriate officer in

that position would exploit his authority to get a lot of

informers going. I do not know how tortuous people's minds can

become. I can assure the Member for Thomson that the job of the

C.P.I.B. is to investigate and be vigilant against corrupt

practices in Singapore in all public departments. As you can see

from the realignment of this job from the Prime Minister's Head

to the State Advocate-General's Chain-hers Head, his instructions

now come from the State Advocate-General. It is an indication of

the way in which this Bureau is being made completely

non-political and divorced from the administration. The Director

carries out his own investigations, and whatever evidence he has,

goes direct to the State Advocate-General who commences

prosecution. I will be quite happy to appoint a local officer

when this officer's service expires at the end of 1965, if we

have a local officer by then who has developed a skill for

painstakingly tracking down corrupt elements. It is the same

technique - I am sorry to say, Sir - that is required in

painstakingly tracking down subversive elements without their

knowing that they are being tracked down until it is too late for

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Prime

Minister has said that the Director of the C.P.I.B. is a very

capable and talented person, and he knows what he is doing. He

goes on to say that if the Director continues to serve in this

post, then corruption will be reduced in Singapore, and there

will be less cases of corrupt practices. In other words, if a

local officer were to hold this post, then, from this logic, I am

afraid that there would be more cases of corrupt practices

because a local officer would not be so talented and capable.

This question then arises: since this officer is so capable and

talented as he has been held out to be, how is it that

word "lies".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has, after Malaysia, made many

mistakes. There are things which he was not sure of doing but

which he had promised the people to do. There are things which

the people do not know but which the Prime Minister promises to

do. As a result, the people of Singapore suffer. For example, on

Malaysia, our Prime Minister repeatedly told the people of

Singapore over the radio, television, the newspapers, and through

all media of publicity machinery in order to carry out propaganda

about the good points of Malaysia, that if Malaysia should come

true, then Singapore would become a paradise, the New York of

Malaysia, happiness for all, and prosperity for everyone. These

are very beautiful words used by the Prime Minister in the past

during his constituency tours. What happens now, and what is the

situation? Malaysia has come about and what happens to the people

of Singapore? What about their livelihood? It is a fact that

there are difficulties, misery and unemployment all round. Even

the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



Minister cannot deny this. He has made promises to the people of

Singapore. He has given the powers of the people of Singapore to

the Central Government, so that the Central Government is controlling our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, all this has been done by the Prime Minister.

He should not do what he did before Malaysia was formed.

Furthermore, we know, and everybody knows, that Malaysia is made

up by the British. As an anti-colonial Party, we oppose the

British and the Alliance for their behaviour. But the Prime

Minister did not do this. On the contrary, in open defence of the

British colonialists in this Chamber, he said that it was the

British who are protecting the people of Malaysia; it is we who

(10 not want war. This is a House of the representatives of the people.

This is not the House of Commons of the British. We are elected by

the people of Singapore, and we have some Members speaking in defence

of British interests. This is the usual practice of the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore. Mr Speaker, if you will remember, last year

when we were debating the policy statement of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara, we gave our solutions to confrontation, and our views on

the dispute and relations between Singapore and the Central

Government, how the position of Singapore should be safeguarded,

and how the difficulties should be resolved in Singapore. At that

time, the Prime Minister said boisterously, blowing his own

trumpet, that the confrontation problem would be solved in three

months. After three months Indonesia would not be able to with

stand the results of confrontation. But what happens now, Mr

Speaker? All those words uttered by the Prime Minister show that

he simply made wild promises to the people, of doing things they

could not do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was saying that the Prime Minister,

during the debate on confrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia, said

that it would be solved within three months.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is entitled to say what he likes in this

House provided he conforms to the Standing Orders. But when he

makes a serious statement against the Prime Minister, the head of

the Government here, he must tell the House, quote chapter and

verse, as to where and when he made those statements. Otherwise

it makes it very difficult for the Prime Minister to refute his

statements when he does in fact answer him later. Will the Member

please remember that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, to continue, I

would like to talk about the Prime Minister's mistakes. For

example, when he went to tour the constituencies, he went to Lim

Teck Boo Road in Paya Lebar. He promised the people there that

their road would be built free of charge. Now the road is

beginning to be built. Yes, there is no mistake. But the money is

to be paid out of the pockets of the villagers living there. Mr

Speaker, this again is a thing which the Prime Minister should

not do. He said, "Free road construction." But he makes the

people pay for the road. This is another instance to show that

the Prime Minister is good at making empty promises. I would like

to advise him that, as the Head of State in Singapore, he should

be more careful in what he says.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. He is not the Head of State. The Yang

di-Pertuan Negara is the Head of State. The Prime Minister is the

head of the Government. I think we must keep those two positions

quite clear and distinct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): As the head of the

Government, namely, the Prime Minister, he has been elected by

the people. He should, therefore, be careful in what he says. He

should keep strictly to his word. If he has made any promises,

then he should carry them out. If he is not sure of carrying them

out, then he should not make them; otherwise the people will

suffer if the promises are not kept. For example, Malaysia. The

people of Singapore are not given equal status, and no reasonable

political power is given to the people of Singapore. They are

suffering miserably in Singapore. More people are unemployed. All

this shows that the Prime Minister did not think carefully when

he did things in connection with the interest of the people. With

his P.A.P. majority, he bulldozes things through. I hope he will be

more careful and alert in future in dealing with his business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I have been wrongly condemned,

for the biggest issue of Malaysia to the smallest issue of making up

a road in his constituency. I do not want to refight the Malaysia

and merger issue all over again, Sir. Suffice it to say that we

fought those issues hard. If there were alternatives open to us

it was not for want of ingenuity that we did not offer other

options. I already put it to him in this House yesterday that the

Indonesians have held out this expectation: break up Malaysia and

resume trade. Is that in our interest? I ask Members in this

Assembly not to waste the time of this House and of the country

dwelling over past issues. Where do we go from here now? Do we

make Malaysia work? Do we break Malaysia as the Indonesians want

to do? If we break Malaysia, where do we go from there? We go

back to the old anti-colonial days of 1955/1959. That is not

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the Member for Paya Lebar that I am extremely

conscious of my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



responsibilities, not only to this Chamber but also to the people

at large, for having got what we in those circumstances could get

to ensure the viability of Singapore's 1.8 million people. Even

now the problem is not the simple one of whether Malaysia has

brought us confrontation, but how do we get out of this

confrontation which the Indonesians have mounted. Confrontation

did not come because we brought it about, but because the

Indonesians initiated this action. The parroting of the line

Malaysia is neo-colonialism does not make it neo-colonialist. I

put this proposition yesterday evening to Members opposite, that

if in fact Malaysia does not work out equitably; if, as is

alleged by Members opposite, including the Member for Hong Lim,

it breeds bitterness, frustrations which will follow if things

are not equitably and fairly worked out, then a new situation

must arise. They know it. We know it. It is our responsibility to

see that these provisions which have been solemnly agreed and

enshrined in the Constitution are honoured and are worked in a

fair and equitable way, that Singapore within Malaysia is allowed

to flourish, as I am sure it will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we get rid of confrontation is another matter. This

unfortunately is not my immediate responsibility. I am sure in

the debate on the Budget in the Federal Parliament, the Member

for Paya Lebar, who is a Member, can take the Prime Minister of

Malaysia to task and tell him how he should resolve

confrontation, it is no use picking up these things with me here.

If he is a fierce fighter for freedom, unafraid of the perils

that fall upon revolutionary fighters who go along with the Com

munists, then I ask him to table a similar motion to reduce the

Prime Minister of Malaysia's salary by $10. Be a brave man. Do

his duties in Parliament, as we intend to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now from the sublime to the road in Paya Lebar. Lim Teck

Boo? I need notice of this, Mr Speaker, Sir. There are a few

thousand roads which have been repaired or otherwise improved

throughout Singapore. I can assure the Member for Paya Lebar

that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



despite the misfortune of the people in Paya Lebar to have him as

their representative, nevertheless, we shall maintain the road.

But if I guess rightly what the Member meant, it means that the

people, the frontagers, the owners of land whose roads are made

up as frontages, they have been served under the Municipal

Ordinance with notice to show cause why they should not pay a

certain sum of money to make up that road. Is that what he

intended'? He said they had to pay for it. .1 have got the data

here how the administration works in the office. Now with peace

and stability there is no need to go around chasing shadows

caused by the united front. Even with regard to a road in Paya

Lebar, can dig tip the information for him. A twelve-foot wide

200 feet long road with metalling costs $17,200. According to

the law, the frontagers must pay for it. They must share this

cost, because by making the road the price of the land

immediately goes up. He is not suggesting that I should help his

capitalist supporters in the area, using public money, $17,000,

to improve the price of the land and not collect it from the

land-owners. I thought he is on the side of the depressed masses, the

poor unemployed, the hawkers, the farmers, the pasar malam

people. He must always try to compete with the Member for Hong

him. He never forgets in his speech the poor trishaw riders, the

poor hawkers, the poor redhatted women in his constituency. The

Member for Paya Lebar, instead of standing up for all these poor

people, is standing up for a few bloated landlords, land-owners

in Lim Teck Boo Road. I am not oppressing the poor tenants. The

owners of land have got to pay. The price of their land goes up

when the road is made, 12 feet wide. If he is suggesting that I

should abuse the duties of my office by neglecting to carry out

my duties ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He is a revolutionist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I suggest that if they find

it difficult to pick faults with my office, perhaps they deal with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



questions of policy. What have we done that is wrong? Tell us.

We want to learn, particularly from wise men of the world like

the Member for Paya Lebar. We always learn from everybody.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in his

reply just now, the Prime Minister has said that because it is

the Government which makes up the road, the frontagers of this

road will have to share the expenses. But during his tour of the

constituency, he has promised that the road will be made up free

of charge. Yet he now wants the people there to share the

expenses of making up the road. The residents in Lim Teck Boo

Road are not landlords as described by the Prime Minister. They

have been staying there for many years. They have put up their

attap houses there, and yet they have been asked to pay for the

expenses of making up this road. They are not landlords. Of

course, according to law, the landlord must share the expenses.

But these people are not the landlords as described by the Prime

Minister. I hope he will investigate this matter.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now

the Prime Minister has said we must talk about our future. Now,

what is our future? If Malaysia is going to succeed, then we will

have prosperity. He says this. Whether Malaysia succeeds or not

is a secondary problem. What we want to solve is our problem of

livelihood. Especially after the severance of trade, the people

in Singapore are now in distress. We must see to it that we have

to solve their problems. Those nations which are against Malaysia

include many of the Afro-Asian countries. Why did not the

Afro-Asian countries in the Cairo conference -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker, it

does not fall within my responsibilities to send representatives

to Cairo, non-aligned nations, and so on. I suggest they raise it

in Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point is well taken. Will the Member

confine his remarks to the Prime Minister's duties?



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we will

not talk about this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem. On confrontation, he told my

colleague that it is useless to raise this question with him. He

seems to think that all questions are of no use to him. I think

he should solve our immediate problem. We have to search for all

ways and means to solve our problems arising out of the

suspension of trade. It is useless to say that Malaysia will

bring prosperity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I go back

to the road in the Paya Lebar constituency? My further

information on this is that none of the residents of Lim Teck Boo

Road are made to pay for anything. If there is any payment to be

made, it is to be made by the landowner, not by the residents.

What has happened, I am told, is that since the road has been

made up, there have been some potholes. Perhaps the residents may

have taken upon themselves the job of repairing the road. Well,

good luck to them. I have no recollection of going around

promising to repair public roads for nothing. Roads will be

repaired. It is the business of the Government. If under the law

land-owners have to pay for improvement on their frontage, the

law will be applied. But we do not make the tenants or the

residents pay. There is no law to enforce that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Tampines, let me say to him that I do

not desire to prevent discussion in this Chamber of the problems

arising out of confrontation. Indeed it is our business to seek

ways and means to resolve the problems arising out of

confrontation and, best of all, to resolve confrontation. But

specific items such as the representation of Malaysia at the

Afro-Asian non-aligned nations conference in Cairo are not within my

dispensation. If it were, we would have done something about it.

It is a responsibility which we would have discharged



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



in our own way. But it is not our responsibility. Our views are

well known. But we do not wish to use this Chamber to criticise

the Central Government for policies in a place where they cannot

answer. What the Member for Paya Lebar has to say, what the Mem

ber for Tampines has to say, can be said in the Central

Parliament. Why did Malaysia not have a representative in Cairo?

Let them explain. I am in full agreement that we should have. But

perhaps there were valid reasons why Malaysia's representation

was not possible. I cannot answer. It is not for me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the broader issues of how to resolve confrontation, I

say, let us have more constructive proposals than just harking

back to neo-colonialism and the dissolution of Malaysia. How do

we resolve confrontation and survive? That is the nub of the

matter. I told Members yesterday that the Indonesians have held

out this bait to us. They will resume trade if we back out from

Malaysia. I say calculate. Tell me now whether that is a good

thing. Calculate. Let the people of Singapore hear their views on

that. I think it is a good thing if we can resume trade and be

friends all over again, but only on terms which will leave our

future secure, not our future in jeopardy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I think there is one question the Prime Minister

can answer. Perhaps he does not like this question. I remember

the Prime Minister in his visit to Crawford Division said the

people in that division are still the supporters of the Barisan

Sosialis. He said that there are' some Indonesian infiltrators

who try to sabotage the unity of the people in Singapore. He said

at the Seremban branch of the P.A.P. that certain U.M.N.O.

leaders deliberately or unwittingly tried to incite racial

conflict. Now that racial conflict has taken place - this was

spoken by him before the racial disturbances took place -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order: The Member is getting perilously close to a

matter which I ruled was sub judice. I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



he does not get anywhere near it or around it. Does the Member

wish to proceed with his speech?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Lian Teng indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,I fully

agree with what my colleague the Member for Paya Lebar has said

regarding the various mistakes made by the Prime Minister. I will

now mention sonic more serious mistakes that he has made. I hope

he will be careful hereafter. Using his Party members and posing

as the Prime Minister, they together toured the constituencies

and called themselves representatives and had meetings with

goodwill committees. Perhaps. Mr Speaker, you have ruled this

out. But I am not speaking of personal matters. I am referring to

the racial conflict that took place sometime ago. But the

representative sent by the Prime Minister went to the goodwill

committees and had discussions with them. In the end, the

representatives on the committee also broadcast over the radio. I

myself was present. Many people went there to see, because they

were also concerned about the incident. The representative of the

Prime Minister arrogantly told the gathering that the Prime

Minister had ordered him to go there to organise a good will

committee. Although this is not too important and the attitude of

this person is not something we can praise, the arrogant

utterances made by him saddened me. I felt that people would not

be taken in his such words. The Prime Minister sent a

representative there. When he was speaking on the platform, he

said that this racial conflict had been caused by the Barisan

Sosialis and Indonesian subversive elements. But after we had

given him two slaps. I think, ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member resume his seat? On a point of

order. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> The Member is now raising the question

of a speech



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



which is alleged to have been made by somebody who is supposed to

represent either me or the Minister for Culture, blaming the

riots (said he) on the Socialist Front and Indonesia. First, I do

not know whether this is true or not. Mr Speaker. Sir, you have

ruled that this subject is sub judice. Otherwise, I would allow

him to make a point on his behalf without being able to answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have just told the Member that anything

approaching a debate on the matters which I have ruled are sub

judice should be avoided. I have asked him to refrain from making

any statement which us likely to excite a debate on this matter

which I have ruled is sub judice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

dealt with this matter, I had already explained my position. I

only wanted to point out that the Prime Minister should be more

careful when sending any representative to act on his behalf. Of

course, I quite understand that any person sent will be acting

like his tail. But the actions of such a person invariably cause

anger among the people, and in the end make the goodwill

committee useless. So I would advise that, if he himself could

not go, he should send somebody who knows the business. He should

not send a person who does not know how to deal with the matter

in question. So I would give the Prime Minister this piece of my

advice.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Prime Minister has also touched on a point

raised by the Member for Paya Lebar. He says that the people of

Malaysia would bring about Malaysia. But I agree with the Member

for Paya Lebar that the Prime Minister has made various mistakes,

because he is making use of propaganda to create a smokescreen to

bamboozle the people, whether locally or not. There had been

information and talk about the consequences of Malaysia. He

claimed that after Malaysia there would he happiness and

prosperity and everybody would benefit. That was what he said

before Malaysia. But now he has changed his tune. He is trying to

deceive the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



Before Malaysia, he said that the people of Singapore would be

prosperous and would benefit. But now he has again given the

promise that after a few more years Malaysia would bring more

benefits, perhaps 20 or 30 years thereafter. Only after such a

period can we see such results. Even before merger the Prime

Minister had said that Malaysia would bring prosperity to us. Now

he is not sure of himself. Now he is assuring the people that

such promises could only be realised many years hereafter, 10 to

20 years. If he was not sure of himself, if he himself was

doubtful, then he should not have made such utterances. This also

shows that Malaysia in the end will bring disaster to the people.

Their sufferings will be more than what they are enduring at the

moment. Therefore, the Prime Minister, as head of the Government,

should think in terms of the future of the people and not in

terms of his personal selfish interests and ignore the future of

the people. The mere use of deceitful words will not be absorbed

by the people forever. The sum of $42,000 under this vote should

be worth its while, and he should not make use of empty promises

to fool the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if my responsibilities

could be measured only by the salary I am paid, I think I could

find much more congenial pursuits besides having to discharge the

duties of my office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to Members opposite that a lot of useful thinking and

formulation of public opinion can be done if they begin to think

forward. Where do we go from here'? Not "Malaysia is a neo

colonialist plot", "Look at it, it has brought us misery and

confrontation". When Malaysia was formed, nobody had the right to

prevent its formation if we decided to get together. We did it in

our best interests. We argued it for two solid years before it

was formed. The day after its formation, the Indonesians mounted

an economic boycott, and severed diplomatic relations. Now one

year after its advent, they have sent, not just into Sabah and

Sarawak, which they can say is disputable territory, but into

Malaya and into Singapore, saboteurs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



and guerrillas. Where do we go from here? The people are

not interested in harking back to this refrain, for the good old

days when we were making money out of the Indonesians - 20 per

cent of our entrepot trade. Where do we go from here? I said to

the Member for Jalan Kayu yesterday - he was not in the Chamber

perhaps - that the Indonesians have held Out to us this

expectation, this hope, this inducement - "Break out from

Malaysia and we will resume trade." I say, calculate publicly now

and tell this House and the country why they think this is a good

idea. Let me hear the arguments that it is, in fact, a good idea,

and that to opt out and resume trade with the Indonesians is in

the interests of the people of Singapore. Then I say it may well

be that Members opposite can persuade the people of Singapore to

follow them. But let us hear the arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to Members opposite that the mood of the country

has undergone a cataclysmic change. Before, just shouting slogans

and holding mass rallies for or against Malaysia was a form of

political exercise. Now the people understand that this is a

matter of life and death. So far as the Indonesians are

concerned, what they want is Malaysia`s death and our absorption

under their aegis, under their hegemony. I am quite sure Members

opposite know that the people do not want that. I do not know

what they themselves want. But how do we avoid that and still

survive as a viable entity? I say our best chances are in

Malaysia. I said yesterday that the ideal paradise was full trade

with Indonesia, full trade with Malaya, plus a common market,

plus industrialisation, which would have happened had the

Indonesians not mounted their confrontation. Two years more of

common market without confrontation and we would have been up. We

had reasons on which we could base our expectations of Malaysia

bringing us stability and progress. But on the 1st May, 1963,

Indonesia got back West Irian, and she was ready to make her next

move in South-East Asia. The people know that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we go from here? Out of Malaysia? Back to trade

with Indonesia? Back to the abolition of the bases? What is the

long-term future? Or is it not better that we get Malaysia to

succeed? The l0� million people, nearly 11 million people, have

a chance, if they are fair to one another, to build a viable

society that can withstand the pressure of 103 million people. I

read in the newspapers that the President of Indonesia represents

105 million people now, and the number will grow bigger and

bigger year by year. And can they watch Singapore flourish all by

itself? They are not even happy to see Malaysia flourish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do the Barisan stand? They are against Malaysia, just

like the Indonesians. They are also against Malaysia flourishing,

because they are against Malaysia to begin with. They know that

they are isolated. That last escapade on 12th September was a

flop. The Member for Jurong should never be allowed to forget

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face realities, and I suggest more usefulness would be served

if we started off on the basis now that we are here with the

Indonesians doing this - where is the next move in the interests

of Malaysia? Or if they wish, just only in the interests of

Singapore. Let us hear it. Tell us what the next move is. If we

are wrong, and if indeed Malaysia is not the way out, tell us.

Mr Speaker, Sir, this subhead 2006 is in connection with

"Expenses of the Senior Trade and Cultural Representative's

Office in Indonesia".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Prime Minister, regarding this $10

token vote, whether Singapore still has such a representative in

Indonesia. If so, how many of the representative's staff are at

present in their houses and offices in Indonesia, and whether

their properties have not been confiscated by the Indonesian

authorities.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In dealing with amendment (3) relating to

subhead 2006, the debate may range over amendment (8) relating to

subhead 3005 and amendment (9) relating to subhead 3006. Mr

Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

our Trade and Cultural Representative stayed on in Jakarta for

some six months after Malaysia was formed. The head of our

Mission there returned a little earlier, and the others were

allowed to continue until such time this year when, following the

cessation of complete official trade with Indonesia, there being

no further business to transact, they were given time by the

Ministry of External Affairs of Indonesia to wind up their

business and leave, which they did - I am speaking from memory

now - probably in March or April this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have kept this item in the Budget, because in accordance with

our constitutional arrangements in Malaysia, we are entitled to

keep as part of the Malaysian Embassy or Commission a Trade

Representative in any of the countries where Malaysia has a

Mission or Legation, and it is our intention, when diplomatic

relations are restored, to send a Trade Representative back as

part of the Malaysian Mission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder why

the Government of Singapore is still retaining various items in

the Estimates by asking for token votes for them. This item

relates to "Expenses of the Senior Trade and Cultural

Representative's Office in Indonesia" and refers to diplomatic

bags, office equipment, houses,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



repairs and redecoration to the office, and other expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the formation of Malaysia, the P.A.P. has changed its

attitude towards Indonesia. In the past, the P.A.P. Ministers and

even the junior officials, stressed the importance of our

relationship with Indonesia. Subsequently, because of the desire

of the Alliance Government for merger and the formation of

Malaysia, the P.A.P. collaborated with the British Government and

they are now hostile towards Indonesia. Now we hear these people

belittling Indonesia by saying that its people are living on rats

and corn. Because of the severance of trade, they say that

Indonesian rubber has been piling up along its ports. The

Minister for Finance has taunted the Indonesians by asking how

long they could continue with their confrontation. He seems to

think that if the piled-up rubber can be sold, only then can the

Indonesian people prosper and not be hungry any more. Such has

been their tune since Malaysia. They say that we are

anti-national. Why? I do not understand their charge. But, strange to

say, in this Budget the Government is still providing token votes

for such expenditure. The Prime Minister yesterday and today has

been stressing that even without Malaysia, Indonesia will try to ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on "Expenses of the Senior Trade

and Cultural Representative's Office in Indonesia". I think the

Member is again embarking on a political discussion of merger and

Malaysia. Will he please confine his discussion to the particular

topic?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like to

explain to you that it is difficult to understand their attitude

towards Indonesia. On the other hand, they are providing token

votes under these various items. This shows their inconsistency

in doing things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Prime Minister and the P.A.P. think that Indonesia is a

hostile country and since we have severed diplomatic relations

with it, why then do they not want also to delete the various

items under these subheads in the Budget? Does this not show a

contradiction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



in the P.A.P.? People would think they are hoping that one day

they may resume trade and cultural relationships with Indonesia.

Since such resumption is impossible, because they themselves have

brought about the present situation, we wonder why they are still

anticipating such a resumption of trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has stressed the severance of trade between

Indonesia and Singapore and has given the people the impression

that Indonesia had intended to sever such trade even

before Malaysia was formed - even in 1959.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something the people have never heard of since the

formation of Malaysia for about one year. Because of their losses

in trade, the conditions of living of the people have been

deteriorating. The people feel that hoping for things which

cannot materialise is not a practical way of doing things. They

have therefore tightened their belts. I feel that what the Prime

Minister has said about Indonesia's intention to sever trade with

Singapore has been entirely his own concoction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The token vote provided here shows that the P.A.P. are

preparing for an exit for themselves in anticipation of the day

when they cannot persist further with the Malaysia plant then

they can find a way out. Because the Prime Minister has no

confidence in Malaysia, trade between Indonesia and Singapore has

now been severed, and Singapore is faced with confrontation. The

Prime Minister in the past has claimed that within three months

he could resolve the problem of confrontation. But now after one

year, when they are meeting with difficulties, the Prime Minister

claims that he can resolve it in two years. Now it is no longer

three months. It is now eight times three months. Perhaps after

two more years, when the situation gets worse, he says perhaps in

five years he can resolve the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also claimed that Indonesia has sent feelers to him

to resume trade and other relations. Perhaps he is banking on the

hope that something may turn up in the future, and that is why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



he is providing the token vote as a feeler from Singapore to

Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, I find it a very tedious

business going back over the whole argument. The position is

quite simple. There is no contradiction between putting the token

vote for our Trade Representative in Jakarta and our position

vis-a-vis Indonesia. The Russians know that the Americans do not love

them, and yet they keep an Embassy in America and they trade with

the Americans. They even bought American grains when their own

crops failed. One day - it is not impossible - the Indonesians may

understand that we are not so easily digested and absorbed, and

they may learn how to live with us. And if they live with us, it

is not unlikely that we should, in the nature of the geography of

South-East Asia, once more have trade and other relations with

each other. This is a token vote. It does not mean that we do not

know what their present leaders want to do to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years Mr Speaker, Sir, we have watched their

activities here with considerable interest. Whilst we were making

alternative arrangements how we should live in the eventuality

that has transpired a little earlier than we had expected - a

complete cut-off of all trade lines with Singapore; if we do not

show that capacity to survive, then this will go on until we are

absorbed. If we do show that capacity, it is not unlikely that

they will just have to learn how to live with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I find it tedious to have to deny things

put into my mouth. I promised confrontation would be over in

three months. Now I promise confrontation will be over in two

years. I never did say any such things. Produce the documents.

[Interruption] When did I say that? My assessment of the position

has been made on many an occasion, that I think it will go on for

as long as they believe we can be absorbed, we can be broken.

They will stop: there will probably be a change of tactics, a

change of technique, the moment they find it no longer profitable

to go on doing this. When that will be, I do not know. It might

happen in the course of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



1965. Hence the token vote. But whatever it is, I do hope Members

opposite will become more sophisticated. We do not have to love

each other in this world to do business with each other. The

Chinese People's Government do not love the British, but there is

a British trade exhibition going on in Peking, and business is

being transacted. Similarly we do not have to be falling over our

selves over the Indonesians, nor do we expect them to hold us in

high esteem. All we need do is to respect each other's integrity

and trade with each other. And if it comes about again, we should

be ready to re-open those avenues of contact between them and us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Prime

Minister was replying to this question, he was putting himself

into a vortex of conflicts. He was quite inconsistent. He said in

the last two days that it was difficult for Singapore to maintain

trade relationship for a long time because Indonesia had

intentions to sever such trade and to establish its own free port

to export directly and buy directly. So we cannot depend too much

on Indonesia. That being so, we must have Malaysia. This was his

argument. From this we can see that when Malaysia is met with di

fficulties, he is trying to find excuses to cover up the

intentions behind Malaysia. But today he says something

different. He says if we should go on like this, then there will

come a day when Indonesia will realise the necessity to live with

us and to resume trade with us. This is very puzzling. On the one

hand, he says that it is important for Indonesia to cut off trade

with us. Today he says there will come a day when Indonesia will

realise its dependency on Singapore on trade. So his arguments

that Singapore is entirely independent on others for a livelihood

cannot hold water. He says we must cling to Malaysia for our

survival. Then he says that Indonesia will realise the importance

of trade with Singapore. From all these arguments one can see

that his past utterances were made to put Singapore into a

pathetic position in order to justify the formation of Malaysia.

His arguments were intended to create some imaginary embar

rassment so as to make way for Malaysia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



Actually Singapore has a very important place in trade. We

can survive on trade as we have done in the past, it does not

mean that we have to depend on others for a livelihood. If that

is so, it is equally important and clear that others will have to

depend on us for a livelihood. The dependency is mutual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said a moment ago that without Malaysia there

will be no way out for Singapore. He was slapping himself. If he is

sincere in solving the problem, I would suggest to him

that the people of Singapore should be given a chance to decide

on the future of Singapore in a democratic way. We can hold

another referendum or by some other means ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have been very patient. I think we are

really straying off the point. The Member can make his point

about Malaysia in reference to trade and cultural relations, but

let us not embark again on a discussion on whether Malaysia is

good for us or not. I think we have discussed that ad nauseani.

Does the Member for Jurong still wish to continue? Mr Prime

Minister will await the completion of his speech if he has not

completed it. Has the Member completed his speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I really have high

regard for their capacity to pursue a given line regardless of their

completely changed circumstances. There is a Chinese proverb, Mr

Speaker, Sir, which I think is rather appropriate. What they have

been saying in the last two days might have been all right before

Malaysia. As the Chinese proverb says, "The sword has fallen

overboard. They mark the place on the ship where the sword has

fallen overboard. Then time passes and the ship moves on. Then

they go and look for the sword at the point where they have made

the mark." Ker tow chiew chien.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has moved on beyond all this phoney

merger - Malaysia is a neo-colonialist plot. I will put the problems

simply to them and if they can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



give me their views, I think we will carry the argument one step

forward. Now, the Indonesians have held out the expectation of

resumed trade if we break Malaysia, if we come out. Never mind

about the interest of the people of Malaysia; let us be selfish

and say let us consider the interest of the 1.8 million people of

Singapore. Do they tell us now that that is a good thing? I would

like to hear that. Then we carry the argument forward. We have

put this as a token vote, Mr Speaker, Sir; maybe in 1965

something happens in Indonesia; they see the light; they want to

resume trade; we resume trade. We do not have to love people to

trade with them. Or just because they want to eat us up but they

cannot, it does not mean that we do not have to trade with them.

If they want, we trade. There is no contradiction between what we

have done here in putting in a token vote and the fact as I said

yesterday, not two days ago (tsuo wan not chien hang tien), that

early in 1960, 1961, 1962, our man in Jakarta, on one occasion,

even had an Indonesian document fall into his hands. What they

planned to do was to cut off the Singapore trade. Let us be quite

honest: they felt that they were being fleeced, being bled by the

Singapore merchants. They did not get the hard currency: goods

were smuggled out according to their regulations because they had

no export permits. They wanted to put their customs and police on

our boats to check as they came in. We kept them in negotiations

for four years, while the trade went on. One of the reasons why

we had a balance of $400 million in the coffers was that the

trade went on. There were cultural exchanges and there were occa

sions when one licence and Bills of Lading were used six or seven

times to get six or seven consignments out of Indonesia. Cases

were mounted in our Courts, proceedings were held. And so it went

on. But life went on. But we knew what was at the back of their

minds - to stop this trade with us. They must, on the one hand,

hope for its continuance and, on the other hand, make

preparations if it should be discontinued. Now it has been

discontinued.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we must be prepared to do without it and

proceed on the basis of just industrialisation and what trade we

have with the rest of the world. On the other hand, it is not

impossible that there will be a change of circumstances in

Jakarta in which they may find it necessarily urgent to exchange

goods with us. They may need rice. People may get tired of eating

corn, I do not know. The situation may alter. If it does, here is

the vote; we do not have to come to the Assembly; we can act and

then ask for supplementary. That is all it means:

a little bit of political sophistication. And I say, let us save

ourselves a lot of argument. Where do we go from here? Not the

old argument, whether there should have been a Malaysia or there

should not been a Malaysia. Members opposite will have another

chance, Mr Speaker, Sir, unless they do something stupid between

now and 1968, when the whole Party may be scrubbed out. I do not

know. We do not want them scrubbed out. We will meet them again

in 1968 and they can put their proposals on the future of

Singapore to the people. As I have said, we are realists. The

arrangements we have made for Singapore in Malaysia, if worked

out fairly and equitably, should see us through. If perchance

things do not go right, and they go wrong, and Singapore does go

South, then I concede to them the possibility in that situation

of Malaysia breaking off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain to them and do their calculations for them.

This is obvious. If anyone of the three new member States of

Malaysia says. "Out with Malaysia," then the Indonesian guerillas

become like the Algerian liberation fighters. That means Malaysia

has had it. They can put this to the people in 1968 when the time

comes. If really Malaysia has brought misery, degradation,

exploitation, subjection and oppression, they will get their

votes. Then every time there is a bomb exploding, it is no longer

an Indonesian saboteur. That Indonesian saboteur becomes a

volunteer fighting for the freedom of the people who have been

subjected. These are on the cards. Our job is to make it succeed.

Their job is to bring the house down. We will see what happens in

1968.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister has spoken too much in order to cover up his present

embarrassment. He says that the Members opposite condemn the

resumption of trade with Indonesia. No, we have never made such a

condemnation. We only want to speak on this token vote in order

to expose their irresponsibility. They try to split up the same

matter into different parts. On the one hand, they say how bad

Indonesia is, and when we pin them down on the consequences of

confrontation, they turn round and say that it is useless to talk

on these lines, because it was the intention of Indonesia to cut

off trade with us. But, on the other hand, they are prepared to

resume trade. We do not want to condemn this action, but we are

trying to expose their inconsistency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has time and again shown that he is one step ahead

of all the others when he explains the justification for this token vote.

He says that we must be prepared to show Indonesia that we have the

capacity to survive and then Indonesia will realise the importance of

trade with us. The people of Singapore are capable of surviving. There

is no doubt about it. We have never said that the people of Singapore

are not able to survive. If we do not have people like the Prime Minister,

perhaps we can survive better. The Prime Minister is always carry

ing out political intimidation. He says, "You oppose Malaysia? If

you do, then you will discover that in the South you will have

Indonesian confrontation and in the North you will have Malayan

confrontation." I do not know how he has based this calculation.

He speaks as though the people of Singapore have enemies

everywhere. He has made a lot of very poor calculations. It is

because of people like him who pushed through Malaysia that the

people of Singapore are what they are. They are isolated. The

people over there make enemies for the people of Singapore. He

has raised one question, "All right, let the Barisan tell us what

we should do about the future of Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go back to the old controversy. There is no

difficulty about it. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



question is: if you want to solve a problem, you have to find the

cause of it. Now, where is the cause? The cause of the problem

lies with Malaysia. This is known to everybody. We have said long

ago that Malaysia will deprive Singapore of its political rights,

that the people of Singapore will not have equal rights

politically. They have said in the past that we have autonomy in

Labour and Education and so we are equal. We have equal rights in

citizenship, and political rights are not important. Autonomy in

Labour and Education is more important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I am transgressing, Mr Speaker, but I have to give

you one example about the autonomy in Education. The students of

Singapore have to apply to the Federation Government for permits

before they can go for higher studies. This is the decision of

the Central Government and the people of Singapore have to

follow. There is no democracy but they say that we must not go

beyond the limit, in the morning they say something and in the

afternoon they withdraw what they have said. This is what they

call autonomy in Education. Political rights are very important

above all things. Are the P.A.P. prepared to fight for equal poli

tical rights? If it is, then we will support them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is, before Malaysia was formed, it was the

British who had to pay for the soldiers. Now we have to pay for

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Could we get back to culture and trade?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I raise all these

matters because the Prime Minister himself has made a lot of

speeches about things irrelevant to the present item. So I have

to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The difficulty is that if one side gets

irrelevant, then I have to give the other side some opportunity

to reply to those irrelevancies. Then we go on ad infinitum like

this. So shall we from now on talk about trade and culture and

leave out politics?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is the last point I wish

to dwell on. If you play a flute before a bull, it is useless

because it will not be able to appreciate your music.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk about another subject. Does Malaya respect

the rights of the Borneo people? No, Malaya is trying to help

the British to deny the Borneo people of their rights.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister has not made an

adequate reply to the points I have raised on this item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am a little bewildered, Mr Speaker,

Sir,I have asked for one simple answer. What is their view?

Now, do we get out of Malaysia and resume trade with Indonesia?

They have not answered it. In fact, because I have now posed that

question, they are talking about merger - equal rights. That is a

new line. Is that really what they want, complete merger, and

that there is no need for State autonomy in education and

labour? Put that in their programme in 1968. We will meet the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish to have a vote taken on

in respect of subhead 2008*.

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim

Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Prime Minister this question. How

many Assemblymen, from the P.A.P. and from the Opposition, have

obtained this allowance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I must apologise to the Member opposite. He should give

me notice of such questions if he wants this sort of information.

Neither my Ministry nor I knew what he was driving at when he

moved an amendment to this vote. The information I have here does

not cover what he wants. All I can tell him is that so far as the

Opposition Assemblymen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



are concerned, there is one Member who is making use of this

vote. That is, the Member for Paya Lebar since March 1964, and

three others, the Member for Jalan Kayu, the Member for Tampines

and the Member for Choa Chu Kang. Three of them, together with

the Member for Bukit Panjang, wanted to employ their own friend,

one same gentleman, as their teacher. Unfortunately, the

gentleman had not got the qualifications. He did not have a

certificate. So we offered to get them a properly qualified

teacher. And there, I think, the matter rested as on the 10th of

July, 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do ask Members opposite that if they want to give their

friends jobs, they should be qualified men and not just friends

for the purpose of giving them $4 per hour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to say about the friend I would

like to employ. What I would like is to pose two questions to the

Prime Minister. The first one is this. When an Assemblyman wishes

to employ a language teacher, what are the qualifications

required of him? I would also like to know whether all language

teachers employed have got the required qualifications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am unable to give a list of all

the former tutors who have been paid out of this vote. But I can

assure the Member for Bukit Panjang that all the tutors who are

being paid out of this vote are considered qualified to teach the

language, either by the Ministry of Education or by the Public

Service Commission. Most of these language teachers in the old

days were qualified to teach the M.C.S., S.S.C.S. civil servants

in Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien and so on. There were

certain recognised teachers for this particular task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this vote and multilingualism in this

Assembly, a number of Assemblymen wanted to make use of this vote

to learn English, which did not happen in the old days. In so far

as the people who were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



brought in were already teaching that language in the

schools, they are deemed qualified. In so far as they are not

teaching that language in schools, they are deemed to be

qualified if they can produce a certificate recognised by the

Ministry of Education as a person qualified in that particular

language or to teach that particular language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arose in the case of the four Members I have

mentioned the Member for Bukit Panjang, the Member for Jalan

Kayu, the Member for Tampines and the Member for Choa Chu Kang.

They wanted to overwork one poor friend. We allowed these things.

But when an obvious anomaly turned up, that is, when the teacher

was going to teach four friends, three hours a week, it would

have killed that poor friend of theirs. It occurred to us that

there must be a special reason why this person was so popular

with the four hon. Members of the Opposition. We thought it was

necessary to find out whether the person was properly qualified

to teach in the language, and it turned out that he had no

qualification other than the fact that he was their friend. We,

therefore, offered them a list of properly qualified teachers who

could discharge their duties, and there the matter rested.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister has said that only those who are teaching the language

in schools are qualified to teach that language. He has also said

that in another category, only very rich friends are qualified to

teach. Has he said that? If a teacher is teaching a particular

language in school, and if we ask him to teach us, then he is

qualified. Is there a Member in the House who has employed a

teacher who cannot speak and teach in that language? If what the

Prime Minister has said is correct, then he is implying that the

four Assemblymen on this side, including myself, have done

something improperly. I would like to ask him whether a person,

be be poor or rich, be he an enemy of the State, can be

considered in such circumstances to have that qualification? Can

that be counted as a qualification?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry that this mutual friend

of the four hon. Members opposite who was considered unsuitable

as a teacher under this scheme should have generated all this

heat. If their desire is to learn the English language, then I do

not see what the problem is. There are a number of properly

qualified teachers for this language. If they do not like any

particular person on that list, they can choose some other

person. But surely they cannot have the whole of the English

teaching profession as their enemies. I am not suggesting that

they should choose an enemy to teach them. Of course, they want a

congenial companion. But I would suggest to Members opposite that

when an official in my Ministry gets an application from four

Members choosing one person to teach all four of them English, it

does seem a bit odd. First, they are overworking the poor man.

Hence our curiosity was aroused as to why they chose this

particular teacher, it turned out that he had no special

qualification to teach the language other than the fact that he

was probably a good friend of theirs. If they want a teacher,

there is a list. What is the problem?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Koo Young, you have two more minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will talk very briefly. This

Member say "this man"? Who is he referring to?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was referring to the teacher

who was employed as our language teacher. He had passed his

Senior Cambridge Examination, and he was teaching English in a

Government school. Is he qualified to teach? The Prime Minister

was talking of a friend. Does he expect us to advertise in the

Press in order to employ a teacher? Last year we were talking

about the insufficiency of books in the Assembly. When we wanted

to employ a teacher to teach us, he placed obstacles before us

and, as a result,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



none of us has benefited from this vote. He has spoken about a

qualified teacher ---

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is on the Land Office. I feel that

the Government is the biggest landowner in Singapore. In many

respects, this big landowner is worse than the other landowners.

The first point is that the Government has taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



back some Crown land. But did it give the land to the farmers?

No. It gave the land to some merchants to wash sand, and such

work has affected the livelihood of farmers. Now what steps have

the Land Office taken to rectify this? This big landowner has

done nothing in this respect; it has not even paid a single cent

of compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to raise is about building. If

one wishes to erect a building on Government land, great

difficulty is experienced. If one wants to build a pigsty, etc.,

the Government will normally refuse the application. In the case

of pigs or chickens, this is all right, but people without land

cannot live. If after a few years a family has increased by three

or five members, then the Government should allow them to build

an extension, otherwise they would not have any place to sleep.

Take a private landowner, for instance. If only a sum of coffee

money were to be paid, that would be sufficient in the case of

private landowners: but the Government would not allow that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am astounded by the series of

completely unfounded statements: first, that we have moved people

out in order to give licences to private individuals to wash

sand. I would like to have the data. Who have been moved out?

From what land? And to whom have we given these licences? So far

as I know the problem, in 1962 we decided that all the

sand-washing operations that were being done were to be done by the

Work Brigade. We gave employment to the Work Brigade. We saved

money as a result of producing sand required for the construction

work of the Ministry of National Development and the Housing

Board. So I suggest that the Member for Bukit Panjang had better

list out all these allegations, and then we might go into them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he made this scurrilous allegation that you can get a

licence to extend your pigsty or chicken run or to extend your

little attap hut if you give a bit of coffee money. Well, that is

what the C.P.I.B. is supposed to look into, Mr Speaker, Sir. Now

that he has this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



information, I suggest that he immediately go to the C.P.I.B. and

they will put the matter right. This is what we are here for: to

see that things are properly and well run. I should have thought

that in the licensing of these huts we have gone to great

lengths. Everyone knows that land is in scarce supply in

Singapore. And what starts off as a pigsty or a chicken run ends

up as a house. Everybody knows that, in the rural areas, you

start off first by pretending that this is a pigsty. Then all

being well, after a period of one year has elapsed, you move into

occupation. And from then onwards, gradually a mansion is built

around it. Therefore, in order to prevent the complete

"squatterisation" of all our State land, we worked out certain

fixed plans. A chicken run shall not be higher than a certain

height. It is good for chickens, more than ample space for

chickens, but slightly uncomfortable for human beings to dwell

in. So too with pigsties. I think it is a reasonable precaution,

because every time the State allows buildings to be built on

State land, it is at the same time undertaking the moral

obligation of paying compensation when the time comes to ask the

squatter to move to make way for building projects for the State.

We do not do this for fun. These lands belong to the people, the

Government. They are for clinics, hospitals, community centres,

schools - all the things that a modern civilised society

wants. Unfortunately, people have moved in for years. Where they

are already in occupation, we do not want a proliferation of

these squatter huts, which has been taking place by way of the

pigsty and the chicken run. We have simplified the procedure and

there are four District Offices where the farmer can go and get a

standard plan free of charge showing what he need to do for a

pigsty or for a chicken run. He does that, and there is no

trouble. It is not that we want to make it difficult for them. We

go out of our way to make it difficult for the Government. We

produce a prototype plan - "This is a first-class pigsty, cheap,

economical and practical, for pigs, not human beings." In that

way when the time comes for that piece of land to be built upon - schools, clinics, community centres - we pay the compensation as

for a pigsty, and the pigs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



will move with the farmer. If we do not do that, when the time

comes, we find that the farmer has acquired a very large family,

who in turn have themselves acquired large families, and all need

to be rehoused. We gain nothing out of this, Mr Speaker, Sir,It

is just an efficient, thrifty way of handling public money. The

more we allow squatters to go into State land, the more we will

have to pay to rehouse them. That is the problem. I would have

thought that being socialist-minded chaps, they would all have

been in favour of protecting the property of the State, of the

people. They suggest that we should allow their friends to go and

"squatter up" the open spaces in Bukit Panjang with more huts in

order that they could get more money out of the State when they

are asked to move to make way for public buildings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister said that he was surprised to hear about the giving of

permits to sand-washing operators. During his tour of the rural

areas, especially Tampines Road, 11th milestone, a farmer gave

him a letter saying that there were people operating

sand-quarries there. He sought the Prime Minister's help in this

matter. After two years, nothing happened. In the end, a notice

was issued to reclaim the piece of land occupied by this

particular farmer. He was shocked. He had paid the rent till

December, but the Land Office, without any reason, withdrew the

licence given to him. The land was inherited from his father.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the Member for Tampines is referring to

some land. According to him, that piece of land was handed down

to him by his father, in other words, he is referring to private

land. We are discussing State land.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the Parliamentary Secretary for

Culture is ignorant, I hope he will not waste much of our time here.

This particular piece of land no doubt is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



Government land, but it has been rented out to this particular

farmer, and the family of this farmer have been living there for

many generations, rearing pigs and operating fish ponds and

coconut plantations to maintain their livelihood. But now the

Land Office has withdrawn their land lease, thereby causing these

people difficulties. The Prime Minister spoke as though nothing

had happened. But this particular farmer had seen the Prime

Minister. But in the end there was no result - the Land Officer

withdrew the permit. Yet the Prime Minister says that they try to

carry on with Socialist principles.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker. I am

really surprised to see the conduct of the Member

for Tampines. It may be that there is sonic-thing going on

between the farmers and him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual position is this. To allow a sand operator to dig sand on private land, a farmer Juts to hold a Temporary

Occupation Licence. Subsequently, this particular farmer leases a

part of his land to this sand operator at a high rental, and one

of the sons of the farmer works under, or with the sand operator.

The Land Office comes to know about it. When part of the State

land is being let out, the T.O.L. licence fee is increased,

because of the change of use from farm land to sand operation.

And the sand operator has met the licensee concerned asking the

licensee so that part of his land can be leased to the sand

operator. He in turn writes to the Commissioner of I ands for

that particular piece of land. This is the true position, Mr

Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the farmer is trying to do is to evade the actual

licence fee. It is our right to take such action. The Member

raises this point without further investigation into the matter.

We are fully conscious that there is no farmer involved in

sand-washing operations in Singapore. For that reason, the Government

no longer issues T.O.L.s to sand washing operators to be sold to

private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



developers. The sand-washing operator is required to obtain his

licence to operate, to dig sand, from the P.W.D. If there are

sand-washing operations, we impose strict conditions to ensure

that the water will not damage the farmers' land and thus affect

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am surprised

that the Prime Minister himself said he was surprised about this

matter, but when I have brought out the facts, he became quiet,

although he is still here. He has got no guts to answer the

points I have raised, so his Parliamentary Secretary has to

answer for him.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Surely the Member can use better

language than "the Prime Minister has got no guts". I think he

should withdraw the expression "the Prime Minister has got no

guts".



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I withdraw the

words. "The Prime Minister has no guts". The Prime Minister has

no courage to answer this question, so his Parliamentary

Secretary has to answer on his behalf, to say that a certain

farmer has sublet his land to a sand-washing operator. What

evidence can he produce to show that any farmer has sublet the

land to a sand-washing operator? This is a very important

point. We know, Mr Speaker, that farmers are honest people. They

live in the villages. They are hard working. They are rustic

folks. They are not so cunning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 77, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister,

this question, whether the citizens of Singapore can become

citizens of Malaysia, and what is the procedure for application?

I hope he will answer this before I go into the debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker,

the Member for Paya Lebar could have obtained all this

information if he had bothered to look up the Constitution of the

State of Singapore, in reply to his question, a Singapore citizen

is naturally a Malaysian citizen. The procedures by which

acquisition of Singapore citizenship can be obtained are all

related in Part III of the Constitution of the State of Singapore

Citizenship and I think, Mr Speaker, it would be very tedious

indeed for me to recite at length all the clauses under which

such applications can be made. However, if the Member for Paya

Lebar so wishes, I can give him roughly the procedures by which

citizenship can be acquired. First, Singapore citizenship can be

acquired by birth, by descent, by registration or enrolment, or

under the provisions of the Federal Constitution by

naturalisation. There are, of course, conditions relating to

these four different methods by which citizenship can be

acquired.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Deputy Prime Minister

has replied to the effect that Singapore citizens are naturally

Malaysian citizens. However, after the formation of Malaysia, we

discovered that Singapore citizens enjoy a different status from

that of Malayan citizens. This is a fact. But the Deputy Prime

Minister says that Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



citizens are naturally Malaysian citizens. If this is so, then

does he not know the difference between the two kinds of

citizens, that Singapore citizens enjoy an inferior status

compared to Malayan citizens, because they have learned from

their difficulties and experience that Singapore citizenship is

not as good as citizenship of the other States of Malaysia? This

is a fact and cannot be denied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has also said that the people of Singapore,

if they want to apply for Singapore citizenship, have to follow the

conditions laid down. Mr Speaker, as far as I know, there are many

people who apply for citizenship and they have to go through very

difficult and troublesome procedures. They have to wait for a long

time, one or two years, before their applications can be approved.

This is a fact. As a result, people shake their heads if they have

to apply for citizenship in Singapore. Even if they qualify to become

Singapore citizens, they feel that it is rather troublesome to apply

through the official channel. It takes a long time, some two years. This is

the usual game that the Government is playing. I hope that the

Deputy Prime Minister will pay attention to what I have to say.

if there are cumbersome procedures, they should be simplified. If

they think that people in Singapore have the residential

qualifications and their applications for citizenship deserve

approval, then they should approve them in the shortest possible

time and do away with all the unnecessary troubles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other trouble; that is, if you have to apply

for citizenship, there will be an interview for you. This

interview is something like an interrogation to be carried out by

Special Branch officers. I have a friend, a young man who. I

think, is a good man hut who may be considered to be a not so

good man, or an anti-national person, by the P.A.P. Now, this

friend of mine is against the P.A.P. to the very last. He applied

for citizenship but up to now - five years - he has not received

any approval. When he was called up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



for interview, the officer concerned behaved like a Special

Branch man. He would ask him. "Where do you work? Where do you

act? What Party do you belong to?" And then the questions about

his friends were asked. "Where are your friends working? Do you

know about the activities of your friends? What are the family

circumstances of your friends? Where do they live? Can you tell

me about the activities of this man and your friends?" Now, such

questions are fired at applicants for citizenship. This is not

necessary. These questions should not be asked of the applicant

for citizenship. What should be asked should be questions

concerning his own affairs, his own residential qualifications,

his own family, and not his political activities, and the

political activities of his friends. All these questions, it

appears, are asked at the whims and fancies of the P.A.P. before

this person can be approved to be a Singapore citizen. If the

person is against the P.A.P., then he has no chance of obtaining

Singapore citizenship. This is political oppression. There should

not be any political bias introduced into the applications for

Singapore citizenship.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who apply for Singapore citizenship will be

unfairly treated. This is not proper. In the meantime, we also

know that the P.A.P. is resorting to these means to oppress those

who deserve to become Singapore citizens and deny them such

rights. Perhaps, if the P.A.P. thinks that it should not allow

the Registry of Citizenship to treat applicants in this manner,

then I would like to ask this question. If the Deputy Prime

Minister feels that the Registry of Citizenship does not behave

in the way that I have described, then instructions should be

given to the interviewer and the officers responsible to behave

properly. I would like to ask him whether the interviewers are

agents of the Special Branch or are they supposed to be working

for the people of Singapore? If they are from the Special Branch,

then they should go back to the Special Branch. If they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



supposed to work in the Citizenship Registry, then they should

work according to the rules and regulations governing citizenship

applications. They should examine such applications without any

political bias so as to deprive the anti-P.A.P. applicants of

their right to take part in politics in Singapore. They think, by

doing this, the P.A.P. may have more opponents in the political

arena. If they think that by so doing the young people of the

type that

have described may become Singapore citizens, endangering their

political position, then this is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, let me ask the Member for Paya

Lebar, just give me an instance where lie says that Singapore

citizenship does not automatically confer upon the holder of

Singapore citizenship Malaysian citizenship? I think it is very

far-fetched of the Member for Paya Lebar to rush into any

discussion on this point. Fell me in what way Singapore citizens

are not Malaysian citizens, like those who come from Sabah,

Sarawak or from Malaya itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his allegation that delays occur when

applications arc made for citizenship, I would inform him that

applicants are interviewed on the same day as they make their

applications, except for those who are required to obtain two

persons to recommend their applications, in these cases, they are

interviewed as soon as they appear with their applications duly

recommended. If there is any delay, it is a delay on their own

part, either because they find difficulty in obtaining

recommenders, or they are unable to come for interview any

earlier. Decision on an application usually takes about two

weeks, so far as approval is concerned, as the applicant has to

undergo screening. Those who apply for citizenship under Article

57 (1) of the Constitution of the State of Singapore, require a

longer period of time, usually not longer than one month, as such

applications have to be forwarded to the Federal Government for

concurrence. If the Member for Paya [char wishes further

clarification, let me refer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



him to the relevant section of the Constitution where it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'any person of or over the age of twenty-one years, not

being a citizen of Malaysia, who was resident in the State on the

coming into operation of this Constitution may, on application

being made therefor in the prescribed form be registered with the

concurrence of the Government of the Federation...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in simple words, means that applications must be

approved not only by the Singapore Government, but also by the

Central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar complains that citizenship is not

automatically conferred upon all applicants. I would let him know

that citizenship is a prerogative for those who apply for it. It

should not be automatically given to all and sundry who apply for

citizenship. Could you imagine, Mr Speaker, if the friends of

the Barisan Sosialis from Indonesia come across and submit their

applications for citizenship, does the Member intend that we

should automatically confer Malaysian citizenship or Singapore

citizenship on his friends? I do not see any logic or any good

reason why citizenship should be given to all those who have come

into this country with one intention, and that is to subvert the

country and to bring about the downfall of the system which we

are practising. Those who apply for citizenship are in the manner

of supplicants. They have no right, no privilege and, in fact, it

is ridiculous indeed for the Member for Paya Lebar to say that

citizenship should be something which should be given on demand.

I dispute that and all those who are citizens here in Malaysia

and who wish to make Malaysia their country of adoption, their

fatherland, will dispute that citizenship should be given to all

and sundry simply because they have filled up a piece of paper

and, therefore, just as of right, it is granted them. It is quite

correct that some of these applications are screened by the

C.I.D. and the Special Branch, But if citizenship has been

refused because of such screening, it is not because these

persons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



have opposed the P.A.P., as the Member for Paya Lebar is

alleging. It is because such applicants have previously been

charged or found guilty of criminal offences, or have been found

to be involved in Communist or Communist front organisations. I

am surprised indeed that the Member for Paya Lebar should hold a

brief for such persons. He should know better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Deputy

Prime Minister has said that the Government will not give

citizenship rights to any Tom, Dick and Harry so easily because

some of them are pro-Communist and Communist elements. This has

all along been the tune harped upon by the P.A.P. When they are

cornered and cannot explain any points raised by us, they bring

in the Communist and pro-Communist elements. How does he know

that they are any Tom, Dick and Harry and undesirable elements'?

He has asked me why I should speak in defence of these people? I

was speaking in defence of this man I was talking about because

this man was born in Singapore. The only trouble with him was

that his birth certificate had no name. That was why he had to

apply for citizenship. Because he was anti-P.A.P. his

application was not approved. This happens generally outside this

House. People outside this House can tell you how the P.A.P. is

carrying out political oppression against its political

opponents. This is very simple. What about Tan Lark Sye? Mr Tan

Lark Sye has lost his ---

*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for National Development

whether there is any Political Secretary. Last year there was

just a token vote. This year we are going to spend $16,200. I

would like to ask why there should be such a post now. Is

recruitment for this post done by open advertisement, or is it

filled by some P.A.P. candidate who had been unsuccessful in the

last election'? I would like to tell him, if it is the purpose to

use public funds to absorb their Party rogues for the benefit of

the Party, then it is using public funds for the benefit of the

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the unsuccessful candidate can get a

big sum of money. If he is unqualified to hold such a post, it is

not a proper thing to do. I would like to ask whether the P.A.P.

Political Secretaries are such persons who were defeated in the

election and whether the P.A.P. are providing these posts for

them as a means of livelihood. The P.A.P. should be held

responsible for this. You cannot argue that because certain

people in the past have been great Party officials or high State

officials, and have now been defeated, they should be given such

posts as Political Secretary. Such an action on the part of the

P.A.P. is not correct.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, during the course of our debates with

the P.A.P., they had argued that this post was to allow the

holder to bridge the relationship between the Government and the

people. Such an argument cannot hold water. If the

representatives have been voted out by the people, they are

persona non grata as far as the people are concerned. So I feel

that since they are not wanted, the P.A.P. should not waste

public money on this post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,

Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu has a very suspicious mind. He

thinks that he is a mind-reader. In my own mind now, I have no

idea who my Political Secretary is going to be. I am on the

lookout for one who will be able to really track down the

propaganda and subversive activities of the Barisan boys. The

reason why I want a Political Secretary how, when there was no

provision for this post last year, is that we are in a state of

Emergency. We are facing confrontation from Indonesia and

subversion from within.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one of the duties of a Political Secretary is to liaise

between the Government and the people. It is also his duty to

find out what tricks the Ban-san boys are up to outside this Cham

ber. Within this Chamber, Sir, during the last few days, we have

heard them ranting and shouting pro-Indonesia and pro-Soekarno

slogans. Outside this House, heaven only knows what they are up

to. Therefore, during this period of Emergency, we will see to it

that we can muster every able man to help the Government defend

our independence and our sovereignty. That is the reason, Sir,

why I have asked for provision for a Political Secretary next

year.

Sir, I have just heard the Member for Jalan Kayu criticising the

appointment of a Political Secretary to the Minister for National

Development. He has said that it is not right to bridge the gap

between the people and the Government. Of course, the Government

must at all times liaise with the people in order to know what

they want and what their feelings are. Political Secretaries are

meant for this type of work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of order.

saying that we have argued with the P.A.P. Our experience was -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That does not appear to me to be a

point of order. If it is a point of explanation, then the Member

must rise on a point of explanation. It will then depend entirely

on the Member who has the Floor whether to give way or not. Now,

is the Member rising on a point of order or on a point of

explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of explanation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now I was saying that

if people who have been discredited by the electorate are

appointed as Political Secretaries to liaise between the

Government and the people, then it is not proper because such

people have already been discarded by the electorate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member for Jalan Kayu is wont to utter contradictory speeches. I

think his own colleagues have the same feeling. I will not touch

further on that point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to who should be the Political Secretary, that is a

question for the Government to decide, and not a matter within

the purview of the Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point that candidates defeated in elections are people

who are discarded by the electorate, then I say that the same

thing can be said for the Barisan candidates as some of them were

also defeated in the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Member for Jalan Kayu had not opposed the

appointment of Political Secretaries. He made mention of Mr Lim

Chin Siong who was drawing a salary as Political Secretary. Why

did he not oppose that appointment then? Therefore, this shows

that they are always changing their stand. When they were

supporting the P.A.P., they said how good the P.A.P. was in

serving the people's interests. But once they left the P.A.P.,

they said that the P.A.P. had sold out the people, and acted

contrary to the wishes of the people. People who often change

their stand will not be trusted by the people. Just look at them

today. I believe that if they continue to change their stand,

then by 1968 they will face a more disastrous fate, I hope they

will consider their position carefully.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody has

denied the need for a Political Secretary. Even the Member who

has just spoken from our side is not opposing the appointment.

The question is that the person to be appointed to the post

should be one who is educated and is worth his salt. If he were

to be the Political Secretary to the Minister for National

Development, then he should be of some use to that Ministry and

capable in his work. Yet the Member opposite mentioned Lim Chin

Siong. [Interruption] Can you compare yourself with Lim Chin

Siong? You are just a small useless fry.

consistent or right.

Why is the Member afraid of my mentioning Mr Lim Chin Siong'?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The subject under discussion is the

Political Secretary, anti not the Member for Sembawang. Let us

get back to the Political Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Therefore, at the time when

Lim Chin Siong was appointed Political Secretary to the Minister

for Finance, he was well qualified to hold that post. His

character was good, and he was very capable and efficient in

dealing with matters. But this is not the credit that we are

claiming; it is something that is recognised by all the people of

Singapore. So he was worth his salt in holding such a post, and

the appointment was proper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, today when we talk about the appointment of a

Political Secretary in this Ministry, we should also consider

appointing a person as efficient as Lim Chin Siong to fill the

post. If not, then his conduct should be as good as Lim Chin

Siong's, and not appoint anyone to this post. So let me tell the

P.A.P. that if they appoint a person who was defeated in the last

elections to this post, then he cannot be held with respect in

the eyes of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member opposite has just now said that my colleague who has

just spoken presents a very pitiful sight. But let me ask him

whether he dares to come out into the open in an election fight

now. We ask him to come out and contest the election with our

Member on this side. Does he dare do so?

<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, therefore, when

the Member for Sembawang raised such a point, he did not use his

brains. His speech was not guided by his brains. That is why he

ended up with such nonsense. In dealing with political issues, we

should speak on the matter under consideration and not just utter

anything haphazardly, thus causing difficulty to Mr Speaker to

rule on the debate. If five of the P.A.P. Ministers were arrest

ed, then the whole P.A.P. would collapse.

says that we should appoint someone to be a Political Secretary,

one who has contact with the public in this country, and whose

appointment will be for the benefit of this country and the

progress of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the name of Mr Lim Chin Siong was mentioned as a

Political Secretary. According to the Frontbenchers of the

Opposition, he was a smart man. This we admit. But his ideology

is opposed to that of this country's and the aspirations of

Malaysia. We oppose his ideology as it is something we cannot get

adjusted to. The purpose of his ideology is to destroy the lives

and property of our countrymen and Malaysia. Therefore, it is

quite proper for us to welcome what the Minister for National

Development has said, that what is required is a Political

Secretary who can really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



be a liaison officer between the Government and the public, and

who agrees with the aspirations of Malaysia. We do not want a

natural requirements and desires of the people of this country.

We do not want such a person to be a Political Secretary in this

adequately with the problems of the farmers? These problems do

not only concern the Department, but they also concern the liveli

problems which face the farmers and which need to be solved immediately.

suffering from such diseases, but until now they have not yet

been able to cure themselves of such diseases as the chickens and

pigs have!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Department study ways and means to cure domestic

animals of such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



diseases, because this causes a heavy loss to the farmers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem is the market price in relation to cost of

the farmers' produce. The price of corn has risen; the cost of

primary foodstaffs and animal feed from Indonesia has also risen.

Consequently, the cost of raising livestock has risen for the

farmers. But have the market prices of farm produce equally

risen? I understand that pigs are still fetching a good price in

the market. On the question of chickens ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Will the Member please speak a little

more slowly? I have received a buzz from the Interpreters to the

effect that the Member is proceeding a little too fast. If the

Member will speak at a slower pace, the Interpreters will be able

to interpret him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, I was talking

about the market price of chickens and pigs. The price of a

cockerel is about $1 a kati, but if the farmers try to sell at

such a price, they will find it difficult to get buyers. If they

lower the price, they will be in a worse position as they will

not be able to earn a living. The price of duck is also about $1

a kati. The prices of vegetables vary - to a certain extent, it

depends on the locality. I will just give some examples of the

prices of vegetables.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, some farmers living in Geylang - Lorong Buang Kok

area - cultivated vegetables which were transported to the market

for sale. The selling prices of vegetables in Jurong, Choa Chu

Kang and Mandai areas varied to a certain extent. The wholesale

price of lady-fingers was about 25 cents per kati. The cost was 8

cents per kati in some other areas. There is a great difference.

As far as I know, in the Jurong area, some farmers transport

their produce to other areas because of the attractive prices.

This is the position of prices for vegetables, pigs and chickens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is fertiliser. Although the Primary Production

Department has some chemical fertiliser for sale to the farmers,

this is not a comprehensive and extensive measure to benefit a

lot of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



farmers. The chemical fertiliser is quite expensive and is not

popular with the farmers. The farmers in my area have told me

that they prefer to buy chicken-waste at the price of $80 to $100

per ton. If that fertiliser is used, it will affect their

livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third problem facing the farmers is a central market. At

the present moment, there is no proper market for the farmers to

sell their produce. By this, I do not refer to vegetables,

chickens and pigs alone. If we have a common comprehensive market

to collect all the produce of farmers and re-sell them, that will

he beneficial to the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the co-operative societies to help the farmers. At the

present moment, vegetable farmers are faced with increased

difficulties. I want to bring out one point. In the Chinatown

area, there is a place called the Sam Kang Association which

caters for vegetable-dealers coming from Jurong and Choa Chu

Kang. This Association re-distributes the vegetables. But this

place is far too small for proper use. I want the Government to

make improvements or find alternative accommodation for a larger

collecting centre for vegetables from various places in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth problem is more important than the others. There is

the question of land. My colleague has just now spoken on the

Land Office.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present rate of development in Singapore, I think it

is the intention of the Government to help the farmers in

Singapore. But it is undeniable that the Government is oppressing

some of the farmers in other ways and this oppression has not

been mentioned by the Government. They only talk about de

velopment and industries and give a lot of publicity to these two

items. One cannot deny that, at the present moment, arable land

is diminishing all the time. This is accepted and admitted by the

Minister concerned. In many places, farmers have to face the

problem of eviction and re-settlement and have to give up their

farm land, If the farmers are forced to stay in Housing Board

flats,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



they will lose their farm land and it will be impossible -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> On a point of information.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member give way? No, the Member is

not giving way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Parliamentary Secretary

can answer later. Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying that it would be

impossible for the farmers to stay in multi-storeyed flats. It

will be difficult for them because they cannot grow vegetables -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like the Member to go on, but he is

really out of order at the moment. He must address himself to the

subject for which the Minister is responsible. Now, he is on a

subject for which the Minister is not at all responsible, i.e.

land. Please continue, Mr Ong Lian Teng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I was talking

about the farmers facing the problem of eviction. Where are they

going to be re-housed'? I am suggesting that they should not be

re-housed in Housing Board flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That would have been perfectly relevant if the

Member had spoken about it half an hour earlier, but now we are

on the Director of Primary Production.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, apart from

this, there is one other matter about farmers applying for

permission to rebuild their houses and this has some bearing on

the Department of Primary Production. If the Primary Production

Department is to go on effectively and efficiently ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The 15 minutes allotted to the Member

has expired.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last few days

we have heard from the Barisan Sosialis nothing but a tale of

woe, about what Malaysia has brought us, the difficulties that we

face, that trade is declining, there is unemployment. But in this

section -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



Primary Production, and among the farmers, Malaysia has brought

them prosperity. At present Singapore farmers are producing

annually an estimated 200 million poultry, 200 million eggs,

three-quarters of a million pigs and 40,000 tons of vegetables,

altogether worth a total of $200 million. This is because with

Malaysia our farmers are able to export their chickens and eggs

and pigs throughout Malaysia. This is one area where Malaysia has

brought us prosperity, where Malaysia has brought benefits to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member was talking about whether we are aware of

the difficulties facing farmers with regard to diseases of pigs

and chickens. He is supposed to be in touch with the farmers. If

he had been in touch, he would have known we have got 8 primary

extension centres. We have to give him the figures. We have

undertaken immunisation, inoculation of pigs and of chickens.

During 1963, the veterinary staff has rendered free vaccinations

to farmers' poultry against Newcastle disease and fowl-pox. Pigs

were immunised against haemorrhagic septicaemia. The number of

poultry vaccinated against Newcastle disease was 7,527,203, and

against fowl-pox, 1,411,265. 6,942 pigs were vaccinated against

haemorrhagic septicaemia. We are fully aware of the difficulties

faced by the farmers and we are doing everything to help them

overcome these diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang was talking about the varying prices

of primary products from time to time. That is a natural economic

law operating on primary products where supply and demand act on

each other and the prices would naturally vary from time to time.

It is impossible for the Government to guarantee any price for

the products of the farmers, unless, of course, we subsidise

them. He suggested that the Government should set up a large

centre for the collection of vegetables so that they can be well

distributed and we can have one price. I have every confidence in

the business acumen of our farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was not asking the

Government to establish a market to collect all the vegetables of

the farmers. No, I did not mean that. What I meant was that the

Government must pay attention to the collecting centre in the

Chinatown area and expand it so as to give more facilities to the

people in the locality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry I misunderstood him. But the

collecting centre that he was talking about is not a Government

collecting centre. As I have said, I have every confidence in the

business acumen of our farmers to sell at places where they can

get the best price. Anyway, I am grateful to him for the

suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, Mr Speaker, Sir, land is not under my portfolio, I

would like to take a little bit of time to answer the Member for

Bukit Panjang. He said that we are pushing out the farmers from

their land, and that they have no place to go to. Now this is the

natural economic law - the best use of land. Even if the

Government does not resettle these farmers who are holding their

land on T.O.L.s, the natural force of economic pressure will make

them do so. There are many farmers who are not occupying

Government land, but renting land from private individuals. Now

land prices have gone up. Even if a farmer should own a piece of

land himself, say somewhere outside the town, he would find - and

it has happened - that it would be more economical for him to

sell his land and do some other trade, or move elsewhere to farm,

rather than use his land for farming. There are instances where

an acre of land which used to cost about $2,000 has been sold for

$30,000, $40,000 or even $50,000. Therefore, as a man who can

calculate, the farmer would opt out of farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of fertiliser, he said that the

farmers prefer to use chicken-waste which costs about $100 a ton

and that therefore the use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



of fertiliser is not economical. There is a Primary Production

Department and an experimental station whereby new methods of

vegetable-growing are being experimented, and from my in

formation, the farmers are taking to these new methods. Results

have shown that by using modern chemical fertiliser they get

better produce than they did formerly. And as a result, we find

that on the same plot of land they are able to produce more

vegetables than hitherto. All in all, Mr Speaker, I think the

Primary Production Department has not failed in its duty to

increase the efficiency of production of our farmers. In fact,

where it used to take as long as seven months to produce a pig

weighing a kati, it now takes four and a half months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young:</b> (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, my colleague

talked about the prices of primary produce but the Minister

talked about Malaysia being able to bring about prosperity. But

increased production does not mean that it is a good thing. If

increased production is done at a higher cost, then the farmers

have to sell their produce at a loss, I want the Minister to pay

attention to the production cost of poultry and vegetables so

that farmers will not experience difficulties. This has nothing

to do with the rate of production. If the cost of production can

be lowered, then the losses incurred as a result of diseases and

other natural catastrophies may be recovered. There are some

diseases and calamities which cannot be cured by medicine or

modern science. There are instances of some 90 per cent of

poultry dying of natural diseases in spite of injections and im

munisation. It does not mean that immunisation is very good at

all times. So the Minister should pay attention to this. It is an

important point, that the farmers must not be asked to leave

their land and go far, far away, it is useless talking about the

increase in the price of land rising from $2,000 to $30,000 and $40,000, thus making it more profitable for the farmers to sell

their land. This is all very unrealistic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



and we have never heard of any such case ---



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired. Does the Member wish

to proceed with a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. I would like to have a
