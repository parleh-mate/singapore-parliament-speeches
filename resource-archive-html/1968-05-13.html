<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Third Day)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question [9th May, 1968],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the President be agreed to : -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our  thanks  to the  President  for  the

speech  which  he  delivered  on  behalf  of  the

Government at the opening of the First Session of

this Parliament.".'.- [The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): MrSpeaker, Sir, last week I was talking about the

fact  that  some people are biased  in  favour  of

white-collar jobs. This is deep-rooted and  cannot

be  easily  weeded  out. So  I  suggest  that  the

Government should hold a large-scale exhibition to

change  the  traditional attitude and  concept  of

parents of students by giving them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



concrete facts and figures. Of course, to change

the traditional education for white-collar jobs to

blue-collar jobs needs comprehensive reviewing and

planning. In my opinion, in undertaking this

comprehensive change of the traditional

educational system, we must keep close watch on

the development of our industries. We must

consider the future needs of our industries and

also the students who, after they have been in

school for eight or ten years, will be absorbed

into our society without any difficulty. The

Government should also plan to avoid teaching

students those subjects for which there is no

application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain fields of education more students have

passed out than can be given employment. I think

parents can have some say in choosing the type of

education for their children. But they should not

have all the say because the Government should

plan well and should give to the students the type

of education they should receive, namely,

vocational, technical or academic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



Without this planning by Government, there will be

redundancy and unemployment difficulties. If the

present trend is continued, there may not be

enough skilled personnel to man our industries.

Therefore, we should give consideration to all

aspects of the training of students, even training

for artisan and craftsman jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before we can change over from general

education to technical education, we have to

tackle the problem of shortage of technical

teachers. On the one hand, we have a surplus of

non-technical teachers, and, on the other, as I

have said, we have a shortage of technical

teachers. So the best way to solve this problem is

to run crash courses for technical education so

that the non-technical teachers will be given

technical training. In this way, they will

gradually be able to teach technical subjects. In

my view, the present Teachers' Training College

requires some reorganisation in order to implement

the policy of re-training our non-technical

teachers to teach technical subjects. For example,

science teachers at present are compelled to

undergo training in the methods of language

teaching. This is an anomaly which should be

removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, our children are fortunate

because the Government pays attention to their

future careers. They have equal opportunities in

education. It has been disclosed in the

President's Speech that henceforth, in the field

of education, we will be paying more attention to

quality instead of quantity. On principle, this is

good. But I am worried that when we try to improve

on the quality of our education, we may neglect

the quantitative aspect of our educational system.

I refer to those children who may be deprived of

the opportunity to go to school on the excuse of

qualitative bias in education. Of course, I agree

that the Government has built many schools. But we

should not stop at the present juncture in view of

the population increase. So it is necessary for us

to build schools in proportion to our population

increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



so that no children will be turned away from

school. We should not deny them their birth-right

to have an education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our society requires people who

are bilingual and trilingual. We have done quite a

lot to bring this about. For example, we have set

up integrated schools and tried to improve the

teaching of a second language in the various

streams of education. But, unfortunately, as far

as I know, the efforts put in in the English

stream in raising the standard of teaching of the

second language have not achieved as much as in

the Chinese stream. I fully support the proposal

that the text-books of some subjects in Chinese

schools should be in English and the text-books of

some subjects in other streams of education should

be in the second language. At the present moment,

some Chinese schools have already adopted this

system by using English text-books in science

subjects. So there is no problem in the

implementation of this policy. But I am not so

sure of the other streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of integrated schools is good. But

sometimes the persons in charge of these schools

are not themselves bilingual or multi-lingual.

Therefore, they are not able to look after the

welfare and interest of the students in the

various streams in the integrated schools. Because

of this, the various streams in the integrated

schools do not have balanced development, and this

is a defect which must be rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of introducing the integrated school

system into our aided schools is good, but it

should not be done in a hurry. We must always

remember the saying, "More haste, less speed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to kindergarten education. We all

know that young children are most impressionable.

When they begin their first lesson, it will leave

a great impression on their lives. Most

educationists have mentioned the impact of

introductory education on the future development

of children. In fact, many countries pay special

attention to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



introductory education of their children. At the

present moment, Sir, what is the position of our

kindergarten education? To my knowledge, and it is

a fact, too, most, if not all, kindergarten

classes are run by private or aided schools.

Because of lack of supervision, many kindergartens

are not able to run their classes in compliance

with the proper and correct principles of

education. Because of this, many of our children

have not been able to receive the kind of

introductory education that will lead to further

development of their talent in future. This, if I

may say so, is a crime in so far as our children

are concerned. I feel that our education

authorities should include kindergarten education

in the education structure in Singapore and make

kindergarten education a very vital link in the

whole chain of education so that more supervision

may be exercised in the kindergartens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is the basis for nation-building

and it is of vital importance to our national

survival. Whether our next generation will be able

to continue the good work of nation-building

depends on what sort of training we give them and

how we nurture them. In this context, I feel very

happy to note that there will be reorganisation in

our educational system. And I hope that the

Government, the parents, the teachers and the

students will all co-operate to help in the

implementation of this work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now deal with rural development.

This matter may be divided into two scopes. In the

first place, we have community projects in the

rural areas in order to cater for the interest of

the rural folks. The second aspect is the

urbanisation and industrialisation of the rural

areas, such as turning them into satellite towns

and industrial sites. It is undeniable that the

P.A.P. Government has spent large sums of money in

rural development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I draw the attention of

Members to Standing Order 48 (d) which reads as

follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Members shall not read newspapers, books,

letters or other documents except such matters

therein as may be directly connected with the

business under debate.'



<br><br>I will be grateful if this rule is observed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for

your indication, Sir,I was dealing with the work

carried out by the P.A.P, in rural development.

The Government has spent large sums of money on

construction work in the rural areas so that the

rural people are able to enjoy modern facilities.

But it is almost certain that the rural areas are

bigger and wider in scope so that the money

allocated to them is not enough to cover all

aspects of rural development. We may be able to

use the money on one aspect at the expense of

other aspects. So if money is spent on water

supply and electrification, we may have to neglect

other aspects of rural development. As far as I

know, if you want to apply for these amenities to

be given to the rural areas, you have to go

through the usual procedure. Sometimes the

official correspondence may take about half a year

before approval is finally given. The work may not

even commence straightaway after approval has been

given. It may take some months before it can be

started. For example, in Jurong constituency, an

electrification scheme was approved last year, but

there is still no indication as to when the work

will start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the Primary

Production Department is set up to look after the

interest of the rural people in order to increase

the productivity of their primary products. It may

not be fair to say that it has done nothing

outstanding in this respect, but I do hope it will

be able to adapt book knowledge to local

conditions. It should not copy from textbooks,

particularly those published in foreign countries.

Formerly, there was a misconception that the moon

seen in a foreign country was brighter than the

moon seen in Singapore. This attitude



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



should be corrected. For example, the Jurong

Abattoir, which cost $6 million, was based on the

model of the Denmark abattoirs, but the efficiency

of this so-called modern abattoir in Jurong is

less than that of the old one in Singapore. As a

result of this, many butchers and pork-sellers are

not happy to send their animals there to be

slaughtered, because the meat of the animals

slaughtered becomes stale after some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also some talk about using the animal

waste of pigs as fuel. I do not know how far this

has progressed. If land for cultivation is

limited, the farmers need scientific techniques to

increase production. May I ask what has the

Primary Production Department done in this

direction? In fact, in order to look after the

interest of the farmers, there are certain things

which have to be done by the Department; for

example, the adoption of effective procedures to

stabilise the prices of farm products and poultry.

At the same time, it should try to eliminate the

exploitation of farmers by middlemen. For example,

the vegetables produced by farmers are sold at two

or three cents a katty, but in fact we have to pay

20 to 30 cents a katty on the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the development of fisheries, I

think the Government should protect fishermen who

use fishing nets. This is more beneficial than

spending large sums of money on research into deep-sea fishing. This is because if we cannot give our

fishermen adequate protection in shallow waters,

how can we guarantee their safety in the deep

seas? As the Member for Punggol pointed out on the

9th of this month, sometimes fishermen are robbed

by pirates in the deep seas. At the risk of their

lives and property, these fishermen go out to deep

waters to fish because within the three-mile

limit, there is not much fish. When our fishermen

meet the pirates, they cannot protect themselves

and often their outboard motors and fishing nets,

costing from two to three thousand dollars, are

taken away. They are lucky if they are left alone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse is that sometimes they themselves

are taken away and are only released after a

ransom has been paid. I think the Government

should negotiate with the countries concerned and

find ways and means to protect our fishermen;

otherwise we will have to rely on imported fish

and other sea products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very proud that we have an

industrial site in Jurong and the Singapore Armed

Forces Training Institute which will help to

develop our economy and expand our defence

respectively. We have to try to expand all the

time. Precisely because of this, the problems of

resettlement in Jurong are becoming more severe. I

must say that in general the people understand the

difficulties of our country and appreciate the

importance of developing our industries and

defence even at the expense of personal loss and

sacrifice. They have given the Government full co-operation. However, hon. Members will agree with

me that when a farmer is resettled, he faces many

difficulties. He has to work on a plot of land

which is often very much smaller than his old

land. His income is bound to be reduced and his

life becomes harder. Under these circumstances,

the Government should try its best to minimise

their difficulties and losses. But what is the

actual situation? Let me elaborate a little. In

certain areas earmarked for development, it is

often not known when the people are supposed to

remove. Sometimes when villagers receive a notice

to remove, they have to do so within a very short

period of time. As a result, they have to sell

their poultry and pigs at very low prices. Their

vegetables and fruits have to be sold quickly.

Therefore, this will involve them in some

considerable loss. Sometimes after receiving a

notice to remove and making preparations to do so,

they are still not told to remove after six months

or a year. During this period, they dare not

engage in production and, as a result, they have

to rely on their savings to tide them over this

difficult period. Also, very often the land on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



which they are resettled is very much smaller.

This is quite understandable, because land in

Singapore is limited, but the allocation of land

should be based on its suitability for farm

production. At least there should be adequate

water supply to feed pigs and for irrigation

purposes. It is only in this way that farmers can

resume production. But in point of fact, some

farmers have been resettled on hills or barren

land which is completely unsuitable for farm

production. Many farmers have begrudgingly been

resettled in Choa Chu Kang. I hope the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Finance will look carefully after them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another point. In certain areas

delineated for development, some residents have

very dilapidated structures and they apply to the

proper authorities for repairs to be carried out

to them, but their requests are always turned

down. The Government officers sitting in their

offices know only how to work strictly according

to regulations without actually understanding the

hardships of the people. Some structures are in

such a dilapidated state that they cannot be

occupied any more, and the applications of

residents for reconstruction work are turned down.

They are then faced with two alternatives: one,

they have to wait till their houses completely

collapse; two, they have to repair their houses

without any authority. If they adopt the first

method, they will incur losses. If they adopt the

second method, the court will order them to

demolish their houses. If they do not do so, they

will be fined and the Government will send

somebody to demolish their houses. If they are

allowed to stay on, they will have to sign an

undertaking with their landlords to the effect

that if the land is acquired for development

purposes, they will not ask for any compensation.

What kind of situation is this? What do you expect

such people to do? There is a saying, "Rigid law,

but flexible application." But this is not so in

Singapore. I do not understand why Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



servants should be so rigid and harsh and do not

understand the difficulties of the people. They

should be more flexible and should not keep

rigidly to the regulations. On the 10th of this

month the Member for Ulu Pandan raised the matter

concerning a coffee-shop owner who committed

suicide by jumping down from a high block of

flats. I believe if the Government officer

concerned had been more flexible and more

understanding, this man's life could have been

saved. Sir, in the coming crucial years I hope

this small group of civil servants will be more

flexible and understand the people's difficulties

and work hard for the welfare of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's

motion.



<br><br>3.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, many sentiments have been

expressed in this House by hon. Members during the

last two days of the present sittings on the

motion of the Prime Minister to thank the

President for his Opening Speech on the evening of

the 6th of May. I share most of these sentiments,

and I ask for your indulgence if I may be

repetitious in some of my remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has briefly set out in his speech

three main objectives which the Government will

seek to achieve in its new term of office. With

high resolve and determination on the part of the

Government and concerted effort and support from

the people of Singapore, there is no doubt that we

will successfully achieve these objectives. The

great inspiration that the President gave us in

his brief speech will serve to spur us on to

overcome what difficulties we have to encounter in

the crucial years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A close perusal of the Addendum to the President's

Speech outlining the broad policies of the various

Ministries and the policy speeches made earlier by

the Ministers in the series of broadcasts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



under the title, "Crucial Years Ahead", have

convinced us of the magnitude of our future

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the move to introduce a comprehensive

Employment Bill which is to standardise and

regulate the conditions of employment for all

categories of employees to replace the outdated

Labour Ordinance, the Shop Assistants Employment

Ordinance and the Clerks Employment Ordinance. At

present, employees in industrial firms and shops

have to work a 44-hour week, whilst others in

commercial firms work a 39-hour week or even less

in the case of firms which operate on a 5-day

week. Most workers will be very unhappy indeed to

see this Bill passed in this House. I can assure

them, Sir, that our Government will see to it that

the workers will be treated fairly and justly

under this new Employment Bill. They should not

have any fear of exploitation by their employers.

I take pride in saying that our Government has

foresight and plans well for our future. With the

accelerated withdrawal of the British forces by

the end of 1971, more and more people will face

unemployment. Hence, we must all work hard for our

country. An extra few working hours a week to an

individual worker is only a small personal

sacrifice, but to a nation as a whole it will be

of tremendous benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate that in order to have a

prosperous and brighter future for our younger

generation, the personal sacrifice of every

citizen for the good of the nation is inevitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to appeal to the

employers to co-operate with and render full

support to our Government with a view to

fulfilling the ultimate aim of the Employment

Bill. They should not treat this as an opportunity

to victimise their employees and cause them undue

hardship and frustration. They must also play

their role by assuring that their employees will

receive fair treatment and protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All workers in the private and public sectors

should be made to realise that they have to give

of their best by working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



hard. They should be aware that all their effort

is for a national purpose. In Japan, the output of

an average worker is one and a half times his

wages. This is not only because of his skill but

also his awareness of a national purpose. Here in

Singapore, we are only expected to put in a day's

work for a day's wages. Surely this is not too

much to expect of our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards overtime work, this should be so

regulated as to give a wider spread of employment.

The abusive practice of earning more overtime than

normal wages should cease forthwith. It deprives

our unemployed of job opportunities. If working

hours are to be prolonged to achieve higher

productivity, more employees must be recruited for

shift work rather than that the same employees do

overtime work. The Government is wise to introduce

this new measure to curtail overtime work, and if

this new legislation is passed, it will help

considerably to reduce the number of unemployed.

If Singapore is to survive and progress as an

industrialised nation, there must be joint

endeavour amongst labour, management and the

Government. We must look to Japan and its people

as our example. The Japanese have been able to

reconstruct their nation from the war ruins within

the last two decades. We should emulate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the majority of wage-earners

or salaried people will certainly welcome the

scheme now being worked out between the Labour

Ministry and the Housing and Development Board to

enable the balances in the present Central

Provident Fund to be set off against the initial

payment for Housing Board flats and the additional

C.P.F, contributions can be used to pay off

monthly instalments of both Housing Board and

privately built homes. To support this scheme, the

rates of assessment may be lowered to attract more

workers to buy their own houses. If the home

ownership scheme is a success, then we are not far

behind some advanced socialist countries where

almost 90 per cent of the population



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



own their own homes. I therefore wish to add that

if the balances of the present C.P.F. can be used

to pay for the purchase of flats, consideration

should also be given to approve the use of these

balances for payments of life insurance policies,

or even more sensibly, for payments of educational

policies for children to pursue higher studies, if

the wage-earners already own their own homes. I

hope this can be worked out at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to Housing Board flats offered

for sale under the home ownership scheme, I have

some observations to make because this scheme

concerns those of my constituents living

predominantly in Housing Board Estates,

particularly the old Kallang Airport Estate. As I

understand it, offers of sale of flats are now

being extended to sitting tenants of 2, 3 or 4-room flats in the existing estates. It can be

anticipated that some of the sitting tenants may

not be in a financial position to purchase their

flats. On the other hand, there may be other

tenants in the same estate who may wish to buy the

flats offered for sale. Mr Speaker, Sir, these

are administrative details and trivial matters,

but ineffective handling may lead to some

discontentment if solutions are not thought out.

In the former case, alternative accommodation must

be offered to sitting tenants who are unwilling to

buy for financial reasons, preferably in the same

estate. Transfer out of the estate may cause a

disruption to their family life and create

schooling problems for their children. These

transfers can be carried out smoothly and

effectively if casual vacancies of flats which are

not earmarked for sale and are at present reserved

for dispossessed families from clearance sites, be

released to rehouse the affected sitting tenants

instead. In the case of the latter, other tenants

in the same estate who wish to avail themselves of

the scheme, should be given priority over tenants

of other housing estates. Mr Speaker, Sir, those

requests have been brought to me by my

constituents, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bringing them up for the attention of the

proper authorities. I sincerely hope that these

problems will be properly solved so that the home

ownership scheme will be carried out effectively.

Again, in this respect, Members of Parliament in

the constituencies concerned should be consulted

and informed before circulars are sent to the

sitting tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I am informed that the Housing Board is

conducting a survey of the feasibility of offering

for sale one-room flats with better accommodation.

I do not agree with the sale of one-room flats as

it is not practical and there will be poor

response. These one-room flats will be rendered

unsuitable even before the monthly instalments are

completed, as the family will have increased by

then. Therefore, any attempt to sell one-room

flats should not be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now opportune for the Government to revise

the educational system particularly at the

secondary level. The stress is now on technical

and vocational training. We are making good

progress on the path to industrialisation. There

is a pressing need for artisans and technicians to

cope with the expansion of our industries. If

Singapore is expected to thrive as an

industrialised society, both parents and students

must now adopt a change in their attitudes towards

education. The traditional bias against work in

factories as craftsmen or technicians must be

removed. Students must look for their career in

the technical sphere where job opportunities are

many and future prospects are brighter than in the

commercial sphere. Whilst the training of skills

is being carried out in technical and vocational

schools or vocational institutes, students should

have opportunities to learn practical work in

factories, in the Jurong industrial complex or

other industrial estates during their vocations.

This will enable them to get familiar with the

actual method of production or application of

their skills in order to prepare themselves for

their roles as artisans or technicians when they

leave school.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards defence matters, everyone is fully

aware of the need to have our own defence measures

for a small nation like Singapore so as to ensure

our security and progress. The people of Singapore

from various walks of life, whether they are

hawkers, taxi-drivers, school teachers, pupils,

clerks or businessmen, have shown their patriotism

by making contributions to the National Defence

Fund. The spontaneous effort of our people should

be highly praised. As a measure to drive home to

the people that defence needs recurrent

expenditure there should be something of a

permanent nature whereby our people can contribute

to the defence of our country. In my opinion, the

best way is to issue Defence Bonds to raise loans

from our citizens, which can be redeemed within

five to fifteen years with attractive rates of

interest. I hope the Government will consider

adopting this proposal as a long-term measure.

This is also in line with the counter-recession

measures as expressed by the Hon. Minister for

Finance in his plan to obtain extra funds by loans

from private sources to meet the additional

defence expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards private participation in urban renewal

redevelopment, care must be taken to see that

tenders are awarded only to bona fide developers

with strong financial standing so that private re-development can be successfully carried out. An

injunction case has recently been brought to light

following a dispute among the directors of a

development company over the payment of paid-up

capital. This development company was awarded a

tender to build a multi-million shopping centre-cum-flats complex. It is suggested that before any

award of tender is made in future to redevelop any

site of State land by private developers, there

should be close scrutiny of the development

company's financial position to guarantee the

smooth execution of the redevelopment plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to express, once

again, my full support for the motion of thanks to

the President.

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many years ago

I learnt that sports and games like soccer, rugby,

football, boxing and wrestling, apart from their

positive value of keeping people fit and strong,

were also aimed at giving men and women a chance

to develop skills and craftsmanship in organised

contests and competitions in order that they would

become more peaceful and peace-loving in nature,

so that whenever they had differences of opinion

which led to disagreements, they could settle them

not by going to war but by thrashing them out in

some form of sport or game played according to

fixed rules with an umpire to prevent the rules

from being violated. Later I learned that archery,

fencing and shooting clubs emerged. I am told they

are not to perfect men's ability to kill one

another but in the hope that war and killing would

be a thing of the past, and that these sports

would help human beings to remember the bow and

arrow, the sword and the gun as ancient weapons of

war. This was to remind them also that their

ancestors were more warlike than they. The first

Olympics were held in Greece for this purpose on

an international basis so that nations could have

a chance once every four years to show their

prowess and excellence in peaceful contests and

competitions in sports and games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are supposed today to be less warlike.

Sad to say, greed, envy and hatred in man seem not

to have diminished over the centuries and today

the causes of war and conflict remain as varied as

they are innumerable. We are constantly kept

reminded that wars, revolutions, coup d'etat,

racial and religious conflicts, economic and

social chaos, still disrupt the lives of nations

and their people. Even today nations still go to

war because of differences in religion, when one

would have thought that the Second World War was

fought for economic and ideological reasons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we see, to our sorrow, that the generally

accepted international rules of war are quite

often not observed. Governments no longer make

formal declarations of war before firing the first

volley or releasing the first bomb from an

aircraft. Those of us who are in our 30s or 40s

present here today will remember the night of 8th

December, 1941, when Japanese bombers raided the

heart of our city within a radius of a mile from

this august Chamber. We will also remember the

surprise attack on Pearl Harbour and the

destruction of American destroyers and other naval

vessels while Japanese emissaries were still

negotiating in the United States of America.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are lessons we learned and cannot

forget. They teach us that we must always be

prepared. While we continue to play games

according to the rules in peaceful pursuits to

develop fitness and strength in the nation, we

must also be ready for emergency situations. It is

necessary that we must know what our

potentialities and limitations are, what our

strengths and weaknesses are. Then only can we

take action and adopt attitudes in response and in

relation to those of our immediate neighbours and

States further away in the world. It is only in

knowing ourselves better that we can, from time to

time, make adjustments to changing circumstances

in the world around us. For the world is never

static, it is always changing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relatively speaking, Singapore is the most

developed State among the member countries of

A.S.E.A.N. In being so, we must be sensitive to

the feelings of others in the region vis-a-vis our

prosperity, whether our success will influence

others in a way not desired by them or in a way

which will win us their sustained friendship. We

must always be mindful when others blame us for

their continued poverty, and for this we must seek

the reasons for this attitude of theirs. We should

also consider whether our immediate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



neighbours appreciate the pace of development and

progress we set for ourselves. And on out part, we

naturally expect them to try to understand us and

the motivations which propel us in carrying out

our policies. Because of the high level of

organisation, adaptability, industry, self-discipline and hard-headedness of our people,

Singapore can be likened to a chili padi - small

but pungent - a very important ingredient in a

palatable arrangement we seek in the Southeast

Asia region. We believe that if other nations in

the region and we ourselves are to hold our own in

the foreseeable future, then the qualities which I

have mentioned plus imaginative and intelligent

leadership and high standards of influence and

effective government are indispensable. I believe

that our friends in the world near and far also

endorse these qualities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the relatively higher degree of

development of the English language, there does

not exist in English a word which can render the

meaning or the sense of the word pedas. I have

heard of the expression "chilly hot" as against

"fire hot" used by some people. But these are

really not satisfactory translations. Probably it

is because, despite having been in Asia for more

than 300 years, the British never got on to taking

chillies. But in Southeast Asia we are different.

Peoples in Southeast Asia are fond of the chilly

and it will help all concerned to have chili padi,

the more the better, for our collective growth and

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore believes that good government based on

wise and inte1ligent leadership consists not in

upholding outmoded dogmas but in solving real

problems in a world where things are changing

rapidly. At the same time, we are modest enough to

know that we cannot produce all the new ideas and

all the new methods by ourselves alone. On the

other hand, we are prepared to look beyond our

shores for new ideas and the latest innovations

from other societies. To us, it does not matter

where these new ideas and innovations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



come from, whether from Communist, socialist or

capitalist countries. Our internal circumstances

and history do not permit us to see different

political and economic systems as systems which

are at war with one another. We have learnt that

we must see these differences as being different

ways in which other peoples are trying to solve

their economic and social problems. We must be

broad-minded and big-hearted enough to know that

these varying political systems may not solve all

the problems. But if they succeed in solving some

of the problems, then we should be prepared to

learn from them even if their system is not the

same as ours. In other words, Sir, we must be able

to appreciate different opinions and views held by

others and that if others hold opinions and views

different from ours, we can still continue to be

their friends. We are mature enough to understand

that in international relations today, there is no

such thing as unqualified friendship among

nations. Our friend's enemy need not necessarily

also be our enemy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the war in Vietnam should give some food for

thought. Despite what is going on in Paris today,

we can see that the Big Powers were and are still

behind the governments in the north of Vietnam as

well as in the south. A small war like this has

potentialities of becoming a big war when the Big

Powers adopt, directly or indirectly, small wars

as their own wars. And any small war can, if the

world community is not careful, be converted into

a trial of strength between the super powers. For

small countries like ours, this means that if we

are foolish enough to quarrel among ourselves and

go to war with one another, then what may begin as

a war between two small countries will eventually

be transformed into a big power conflict. And once

that happens, the issues which have led the small

countries into war will be left in the background

and will be taken over by issues which have

nothing at all to do with the two countries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



concerned. In a short time, there would have been

so many killed and wounded, soldiers as well as

civilians, on both sides who could have better

contributed to their country's peaceful

development. In other words, the small countries

will be fighting not really on behalf of their own

national interests but on behalf of the interests

of the bigger powers. Small countries cannot

prevent big power conflicts taking place among

super powers, but they can minimise the chances of

big power conflicts breaking out by not going to

war with one another. We have seen in the years

after the Second World War how foolish and

thoughtless governments of small countries have

entered into big power conflicts by openly taking

the side of one of the big powers against another.

So we should try never to get into such a

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this spirit of independent thinking and

realism in international relations that we in

Singapore approach the world's problems. We hope

this will be the basis on which relations between

not only Singapore and her immediate neighbours

but Singapore and all other States in the world

can be established and strengthened.



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the people of Thomson,

I express my full support for the motion in the

name of the Prime Minister thanking the President

for his policy speech in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the President's Speech and the Addendum to his

Speech, he has correctly and practically outlined

the policies of the Government, particularly in

regard to the ways and means of solving the

problems arising out of the accelerated withdrawal

of the British Military Forces from Singapore, in

order to ensure the continued prosperity and

stability that we enjoy. These policies receive

and deserve the full support of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Addendum to the

President's Speech, there is one section which

deals with the Social Welfare Department. Social

welfare may be curtailed because of the defence

expenditure involved. I wish to amplify on this

section. We know that the social services of a

nation must be geared to the social organisation

and the actual needs of society. We should not

curtail our expenditure in this respect because of

an increase in our defence expenditure. On the

contrary, we must continue to provide social

services to look after the less fortunate people

in our society, particularly in the trying years

ahead. If we do not have well-organised private

charitable organisations to continue looking after

the needy people in our society, we will see these

people roaming in the streets. Therefore, Mr

Speaker, it is heartening to note that there is no

curtailment of expenditure in health and education

because of an increase in defence expenditure. It

has been stated in the Addendum to the President's

Speech that the standard of health, particularly

public health, will be raised. This is

praiseworthy and deserving of our support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On education, it is also stated that all

available resources will be utilised in the

organisation of the secondary education system so

that more students will be rechannelled into

technical education. At the same time, the

standard of secondary languages will be raised to

suit the practical needs of our society. We will

require more professional and technical personnel

to man our industries and improve our commercial

activities. Therefore, in view of all these

improvements and reorganisation. We will be on the

right path to greater success and prosperity. All

these policies are welcomed by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us turn to social affairs. It is to be noted

that the social services in Singapore have been

acknowledged to be the best in the whole of

Southeast Asia. We must continue to maintain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



this reputation and even improve on it. So I hope

that public assistance will not be reduced. The

people who require public assistance must continue

to get it all the same. We know that there is

provision for public assistance to be given to the

poor and sick in our society. Under the public

assistance scheme, there are certain conditions

and the rates are as follows:



<pre>

        $21 per month for the head of family;

        $10 per month for the wife;

        $ 8 per month for each dependant above 16 years; and

        $ 5 per month for each dependant under 16 years.

</pre>



<br><br>The total amount in public assistance to a family

shall not exceed $90 per month. This assistance in

itself is not enough to maintain the livelihood of

a family particularly at the present juncture, as

the cost of living has been rising over the years.

I suggest that the unfortunate members of our

society be given more public assistance, if

finances permit. At least they should be given

public assistance to subsist. But, unfortunately,

as far as I know, the situation is rather

disappointing. Perhaps it is because the funds

allotted to public assistance are not sufficient.

I understand that from the beginning of this

month, the head of a family will receive $16 per

month. This will put us back to the position in

1961 and it is one step backward. We should be

very concerned for the needy and unfortunate

members of our society. I hope the Minister for

Social Affairs will assure this House that public

assistance will not be cut in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, with regard to our defence, I

hope the Minister will take note that a problem

exists as regards public assistance. If a member

of any family joins the National Defence Corps or

is a national serviceman, public assistance to

that family is withdrawn. We all know that

national service and military service for the

protection of our lives and property and for the

defence of our territory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



should be encouraged. In fact, we have given those

of our youths called up for national service a big

send-off at various community centres. A member of

the National Defence Corps is given only about

$2.50 as transport allowance, and members in the

Reserves or in the regular Armed Forces are given

only some allowances which are barely enough for

them. So you cannot expect national servicemen or

members of the Armed Forces to be able to support

their families with the allowances that they

receive It is, therefore, wrong to withdraw public

assistance from such families. Mr Speaker, Sir,

we know that at the present juncture, we are

encouraging our young men to join the Army to fill

the vacuum which will be left behind by the

accelerated withdrawal of British troops from

Singapore. It is most unfortunate that it will

cost the loss of public assistance to a family if

one of its members joins the Army to protect our

country. He will bring financial disaster upon his

family. This will probably deter our young people

from joining the Armed Forces. I hope the Minister

will take corrective action in this regard.



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): MrSpeaker, Sir, the basic creed and belief of the

People's Action Party is the building up of a non-Communist, democratic multi-racial society. At the

recent general elections, the people exercised

their democratic right to elect once again the

P.A.P, into office and gave it their trust and

confidence. As a result of this, all the Members

here today are members of the P.A.P. This is a new

situation that we are witnessing today. I believe

that all my colleagues are proud of this fact and

will be greatly encouraged. In fact, the duty to

develop and defend our country rests on us.

Without the presence of an Opposition in this

House, we should all the more keep an eye on any

changes in the situation, and see to the need of

nation-building. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



should carry out with renewed effort the tasks

which the people have placed on us so that the

"stars" in our midst, on whom many eyes are fixed,

may rise and give off their brilliance in

Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new situation, my colleagues and I

will try our best to carry out the basic policies

of our Government with confidence, endurance and

ability in order to achieve success. Ever since

the P.A.P. was entrusted by the people with the

management of the affairs of the country, we have

weathered many storms. We have been thoroughly

tested. Events have proved that the P.A.P. is a

party standing on solid ground. It is able to

withstand any test. On the other hand, when we

look at the other political parties, we see that

they only come into existence when a general

election is due to be held. They have no long-term

political objectives. In fact, most of our

colleagues in this House have already had the

experience and taken up the responsibilities and

task of an Opposition in this House. They have

contributed much as an Opposition. Therefore, it

speaks volumes for the present Government that it

has principles and can fulfil the tasks which the

people have entrusted to us. The P.A.P. is a party

which has long political experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about the new political situation,

many people have an erroneous concept that when we

talk about democratic politics, there must be an

Opposition in the House. Otherwise, they say,

there is no democracy. This concept, I feel, is

without any foundation in democratic politics. A

political party comes to power not from the theory

of democratic politics or from the constitution,

but as a result of the free expression of the will

of the people. Democratic politics is a system by

which the people manage their own affairs. It is a

system established by the people themselves so

that they will have the opportunity and the right

to rule their country. Provided the party in power

can carry out the tasks given to it by the people,

it does not matter even if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



there is no opposition party in this House. On the

contrary, if there is an opposition but because of

self-interest it discards its responsibilities and

even goes to the extent of doing things contrary

to the interest, well-being and livelihood of the

people of the country, then the existence of such

an opposition party is no good at all. In fact, a

lot of harm will be done. The constitution of a

country lays down that its citizens have the right

to take part in elections or be elected to office.

But it does not lay down what political party

should be in power to rule the country. In fact,

political parties are the product of the

provisions in the constitution which say that the

people have the right to elect their own

government. The P.A.P. was elected according to

the constitution of this country. It is a party

that has been entrusted by the people with a new

mandate. The P.A.P. has formed its government

which is entirely based on the wishes and action

of the people. We do not see any political

philosophy in other political parties. Therefore,

fundamentally, they do not receive the people's

confidence. They cannot appeal to the people to

support their policies. It is no wonder that all

the people are supporting the present party in

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present situation, the new Government is

taking up the onerous task of nation-building as

an independent State in a practical manner. It has

become the core of the whole nation. It is

implementing the task of laying a sound foundation

for a democratic system of government. It is

showing that it can even do without the assistance

of an opposition party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at the present juncture, we must

understand the objectives and principles involved

in nation-building. In this way we will be able to

chart better the destiny of our people. As we all

know, the basic work in nation-building involves

military, economic and social aspects. That means

that we must try to build up our political

strength in order to influence the development of

our economy. The policy is that our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



economy should be geared to our defence needs. The

next aspect to consider is that we must be able to

maintain and improve our social and political

stability. The third aspect is that through social

construction must come about a spirit of national

consciousness among the people which would lead to

the enhancement of the moral values of our people.

To sum up, we should inculcate in our people a

national spirit which is the starting point of all

our efforts in nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the life of an individual is the same

as that of a nation. If a man is without a soul,

then he is nothing but a perambulating corpse. A

nation must have a national spirit which is the

national soul. Without a national soul a country

will not be able to last forever. If a nation has

no national spirit, it will be disunited,

corrupted, degenerate and disorganised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, let us look at our own nation.

What is the present situation? Ever since we

became independent, our Government has spared no

efforts to carry out social and economic

development. It has also spared no efforts to

strengthen our defence. We have made an appeal to

our people to build a rugged society with a view

to nurturing the next generation so that it will

be able to stand firmly on our own soil. These are

the principles governing our development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is another aspect of our

social development. This is pathological. I refer

to the fantastic mushrooming of bars and night-clubs in Singapore. As evident in the recent past,

there is a great deal of prosperity in Singapore,

and hence a boom in night-clubs and bars. We have

more and more night-clubs and bars coming up in

Singapore. At the same time, many so-called

artistic troupes have come to Singapore to give

public performances. There are several

explanations for the mushrooming of night-clubs.

One of them is that it is necessary to have bars

and night-clubs in order to promote tourism.

Another explanation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



is that this is possibly the beatnik philosophy of

those people who try to satisfy their needs for

excitement and stimulation in a turbulent world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us return to reality to understand this

problem. First of all, as far as I understand, the

people who frequent these places of pleasure are

not really tourists. In terms of proportion, among

those who frequent bars to get a drink, over 90

per cent come from the lower and middle classes of

our population. Furthermore, 70 per cent of these

people are wage-earners. If we allow our citizens

to frequent bars, then it will be a test of our

future. Excessive indulgence by a number of our

citizens in womanising, gambling, drinking and all

sorts of debauchery, will have an Un-favourable

influence on the structure of our society, which

is a newly emergent society. This will lead to its

deterioration. Sir, man cannot withstand

temptation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> When you started with, "Man cannot...", I thought you were going to say, "Man cannot

live by bread alone!" [Laughter.]



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

everyday our Government leaders, especially our

Prime Minister, emphasise that the skill of the

people in nation-building is important. Every

year, many young people leave school to seek

employment. But can we be sure that they will not

be tempted? If our reply is that we are not sure,

then the basis for nation-building will be

affected. Sir, those who are present here may also

be affected by this poison. Then what will happen

to our society? In raising this problem, I do not

wish to suppress the natural instincts of man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wish to do is to provide the authorities

concerned with an understanding of the problem so

that they will look at it as newsmen in the

promotion of tourism. As a modern people, we

should have a clear understanding of the problems

of sex. The difference between human beings and

animals lies in the fact that, in addition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



to instincts, including the instinct of self-preservation, human beings have the benefit of

education, an appreciation of culture and of the

meaning of life. The propagation of the race is

the creation of life. If men were to indulge in

sex and the pursuit of pleasure and sacrifice the

instincts of man, then the meaning of life will be

lost. Put simply, a meaningful life must have

certain standards or limitations in regard to the

problems of sex and the pursuit of pleasure. We do

not wish to suppress the basic needs of human

beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to emphasise the

following points. First, the development of

tourism is an important factor in the development

of our economy. But in so doing, the authorities

should have new ideas in tackling this problem. In

addition to looking after the tourists, the

interest of our local citizens should also be

cared for. Singapore and Hong Kong are not the

same in geographical location. Even politically,

Singapore is quite different from Hong Kong. We

are an independent country. Hong Kong is a colony

controlled by another country. In the promotion of

tourism we do not have to rely on the promotion of

unhealthy pleasures. What we should try to do

instead is to encourage tourists to have a good

opinion of us and a healthy respect for our

country. And this will help us internationally. In

other words, we should not rely on European forms

of entertainment to promote tourism. We have many

cultures which do not exist in European countries.

The National Theatre and the Ministry of Culture

should look into this problem of promoting

tourism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second problem I wish to mention is the

enlargement of employment opportunities for women.

In his speech to Parliament, the President has

revealed that new policies and new plans will be

implemented in the Ministries to tackle the

problems facing us in the crucial years ahead.

These policies are designed to overcome our

difficulties and to lead our country to a more

peaceful, secure, prosperous and progressive

future. As the only female



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



Member of Parliament in this House, I am

particularly concerned with the role which women

can play in nation-building. I am concerned with

the problem of getting equal employment

opportunities for women. The development of our

economy depends not only on our geographical

position and our port, but also on our human

resources. In this respect, women make up half of

the total population of our country. And the

potential strength of our women in nation-building

should not be overlooked. But if we want women to

play a greater part in nation-building, a pre-requisite is to allow them to have the chance to

learn various skills and acquire knowledge. In the

Addendum to the President's Speech, it is stated

that the education system of our secondary schools

will be revised. The idea behind this is to enable

more students to take up technical education and

vocational training. The Government has already

set up a Cabinet Committee comprising the Minister

for Education, the Minister for Labour and the

Minister for Finance to look into the problem and

to supervise the planning and implementation of

technical education and vocational training. This

is to avoid any possible duplication in planning

and implementation of technical education and

vocational training, and to ensure that they

correspond with our manpower needs and employment

opportunities. I am sure that no one will disagree

with me that the educational system must be based

on the needs of our country and that it will have

to be revised with the emphasis on technological

and technical education. But on behalf of the

women in Singapore, I must make a request to

Parliament that the Government should include

women in the planning and implementation of

technical education and vocational training. Mr

Speaker, Sir, the reason why I want to emphasise

this is that I am worried that the women of

Singapore will be excluded from taking part in the

planning and implementation of technical education

and vocational training. Certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



problems at present show that this possibility

exists. Therefore, we should not lay emphasis on

the training of males only in special skills. We

all know that the scope of employment for women is

severely limited. Other than becoming Government

and commercial employees and doctors, most of them

get jobs as hotel receptionists, bar girls,

waitresses or even dance hostesses, singers and

the like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the policy planners and administrators

should not neglect this fundamental principle when

they go about their job. They should not deprive

women of the opportunity to contribute their bit

to the country. Half of our population of two

million consists of women, as I have already said

just now, but the rate of employment of women is

rather slow. Women have very limited employment

opportunities and various kinds of restrictions

are imposed on them. Many Government and private

institutions are reluctant to engage female staff

or workers because of the influence of a backward

traditional concept. There are very few

opportunities for women to receive specialised

training, as a result of which a large number of

women have no other alternative but to become

waitresses, receptionists, dance hostesses, bar

girls, etc. Of course, I am not saying that such

occupations are not fit for them, because there

should be no discrimination against or disrespect

for any kind of occupation. In every society,

there must be different people doing different

jobs. They are also making a living in their own

jobs. Such people are also respected subjects of

our country. The Government should take steps to

ensure that women will have a wider range of

employment opportunities, and more suitable jobs.

I believe that intellectually and physically women

can do many kinds of jobs of a technical and

mechanical nature. We can see many such examples

in advanced countries, where they have female

engineers, pilots, ship captains, drivers,

technicians, artisans, etc. There is no reason for

the women of Singapore to be more backward than

their sisters in other countries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



in this respect, in view of the fact that in the

last decade, they have enjoyed equal opportunities

in education and their general level of knowledge

has risen. Therefore, the present distinction in

employment opportunities for men and women is man-made. This is due to bad traditions and to the old

concept that women are not suitable for technical

jobs. These traditions and concept should be done

away with today. Although the policy planners

cannot stipulate what percentage of women should

have technical and technological training, the

Government should provide equal opportunities for

women to receive it. I believe, and everybody will

agree with me, that of the population of two

million in Singapore, more than half are women.

Fifty per cent of the electorate comprise women

too, and they have exercised their constitutional

right to elect the Government. Therefore, the

Government should treat them with equal fairness.

Of the 58 Members here, all are men except myself.

Maybe there are more women than men in their

constituencies and they have already done their

bit for the country. They have also entrusted

their future in our hands. So I hope that when

Members visit their constituents, they will not

say, "Oh, because you are a female voter and not a

male voter, there must be some sort of unequal

treatment."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, my hope is that the gate to learning

can be opened wide to enable more women to have

equal opportunities to receive technical or

academic training. It should not also be

stipulated that only male students be recruited

for employment. Women should also be given

opportunities for employment. Only by this means

can the employment opportunities for women be

widened. We can then have a healthy society. This

is my hope.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> r Speaker, Sir, the new targets so concisely

enunciated by the President will undoubtedly exert

much   impact   on   the  Ministry   of   Culture.

Nevertheless, the basic objectives and policies of

the Ministry will not be radically altered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still the cornerstone of our policy to

preserve   the  values  of  our  various  cultural

streams  in  the  context of  striking  a  balance

between the need for homogeneity against the  need

for  heterogeneity.  The result  of  this  process

during the last nine years is that ours is already

a  cohesive  society. This is not the end  of  the

road. The need to socialise our people into modern

and better ways of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



life  still  remains. It is a continuous  process,

particularly vis-a-vis the problems in the crucial

years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democratic society like ours, it has not

been  and  will not be our intention to attempt  a

cultural dictatorship, which means imposing on the

people criteria of what the ruling elite considers

to  be  the norms. Instead, culture should  evolve

from  the  ground. It is worth while  to  remember

that  certain  countries in which  culture  became

part  of  the state mechanism have now decided  to

liberalise this activity which properly should  be

a  non-state  area  of human endeavour.  For  this

reason  the  Ministry  of Culture  is  only  in  a

position  to  provide the catalyst  for,  and  not

dictate  a set of arbitrary pattern on the people.

For  the same reason, our cultural policy  is  not

characterised  by bans on low-brow  literature  or

entertainment; ours is a creative way of  cultural

nation-building, since the solution  lies  not  in

negatively banning this or that, but in positively

providing channels for creative activity  so  that

the  general public can develop critical awareness

of  what  is  good  and what is bad,  and  in  the

process spontaneously reject what has no social or

other  values  and,  worse still,  that  which  is

degrading and detrimental to human dignity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to talking about culture, it always

occurs  to me that there are some Members in  this

House  who cherish distorted ideas about  culture.

They  seem  to think that the more and the  louder

they  condemn the so-called "yellow culture",  the

more  cultured  they become in  the  eyes  of  the

public.  So,  not infrequently in this  House  the

Ministry  of  Culture was accused of knowingly  or

unknowingly   promoting  "yellow   culture".   The

trouble  with these Members is that  they  do  not

know what "yellow culture" really means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can understand and remember, the term

"yellow   culture"  was  coined  by  the   Chinese

Communists in the early days to describe all forms

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



art  and  cultures which did not toe the  line  of

Communist political propaganda. If you look up any

common English dictionary, you will never find the

term "yellow culture" in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Communist argument, the

democratic society of the non-Communist world is a

dying,  decadent society and all forms of art  and

cultures coming from that society must necessarily

be  yellow culture. Only the Communist society  is

capable of producing healthy and good culture  for

the  people.  But  there are some exceptions.  The

arts   created   or  promoted  by  Communists   or

Communist sympathisers in the non-Communist world,

those  whom  the  Communists term  as  "democratic

elements"-  min shu ren sheh - can be accepted  by

the Communist critics as good and healthy. Thus  a

song sung by Paul Robeson is good and healthy, but

the  same song sung by, say, Sidney Poitier or Nat

King  Cole,  may  be condemned as yellow  culture.

(But that was years ago when Paul Robeson used  to

perform in Moscow and when Peking and Moscow  were

on good terms. Now that Peking has fallen out with

Moscow,  I am not sure whether he still  gets  the

same favourable treatment.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember years ago, when I was still very

young, I was very fond of the Cantonese Opera  and

my  Communist  friends used to advise  me  not  to

waste  my  time  in this form of  feudalistic  and

decadent  culture. But when the Chinese Communists

took  over  China  in  1949  and  after  they  had

produced one or two films of Cantonese Opera, with

the same actors and actresses who had crossed over

from  Hong Kong, we were all exhorted to see these

films  which  were  praised as the  best  form  of

culture ever produced by China. Now, with the  Red

Guards  and  the cultural revolution sweeping  all

over  China, I am told that these films have  been

committed to the public bonfires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, Russian dances and folk songs used

to   be   very   popular   among   the   so-called

"progressive  elements"  in  Singapore.   If   you

visited  any  of  the premises of  the  Old  Boys'

Associations in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



those  days, you would find young boys and  girls

sweating  away rehearsing Russian or East European

folk  dances.  Those who did not appreciate  these

dances  were  branded  as "backward  elements"  or

"reactionary  forces". Now that they  have  broken

away from the Russians, I presume they are equally

busy  in  condemning Russian dances as revisionist

and decadent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how the Communists treated culture: with

changing  values all the time and always  dictated

by their current political thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten or twelve years ago, when the Communist

agitation was at its peak in Singapore, "Down with

yellow  culture" was one of the favourite  slogans

used by the Communists to rally the people against

the  British  colonialists.  Since  Communism  was

publicly  banned, very soon the term  "anti-yellow

campaign"  became synonymous with  the  "Communist

movement".  When your friends talked  about  anti-yellow  campaigns,  you  knew  exactly  what  they

meant.  And  very  significantly, the  anti-yellow

campaign was initiated by a pro-Communist  Women's

Association which the colonial Government  had  to

deregister  later. In carrying out the anti-yellow

campaign,  the Communists were trying to  get  the

people to reject all forms of culture and art from

the  Western world and accept the cultural  values

and  ideology imposed by them. These were all very

expertly  carried out without the innocent  people

knowing that they were being indoctrinated for the

Communist   cause.  Many  talented  artistes   and

writers  were drawn into their camp. I know  their

techniques very well and if I were to tell you  in

detail  how  they  sought  to  convert  people  to

Communism  under  the disguise of the  anti-yellow

campaign, the short time available to me  in  this

House  would not be enough, for I was one of  them

and  I  know  their methods and techniques  inside

out.  I  know  all  the double meanings  in  their

phrases and terminology and all their double talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at one time I was helping them to direct

the so-called cultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



campaign.  And that was long before  some  of  our

Barisan  friends knew anything about Communism.  I

ran    several   publications   for   them,   some

underground  and some above ground. The  Communist

agitation had two prongs. One was the organisation

of workers and students for industrial strikes and

school  sit-ins. Another was the  conduct  of  the

cultural campaign where they recruited workers for

their propaganda machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson behind all this is that we must be

very  careful  when we pick up terms  and  slogans

passed on to us by the Communists. Of course, I do

not  mean that what the Communists say is bad  for

us  and  vice versa, and therefore we must do  the

reverse  of  what they do. But we must decide  for

ourselves what we want for our culture and we must

have  our own yardstick and criteria and  not  the

values and the likes and dislikes imposed upon  us

by the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be liberal in our outlook and we must not

be  afraid of accepting new ideas and new forms of

art.  Singapore is the cross-road of Asia and  the

Western  world.  New  ideas and  new  trends  flow

freely into Singapore and pass on to other places.

We  cannot  isolate ourselves from the changes  of

the  world.  We can be selective but we  must  not

close  our eyes to the new things in life. We  can

retain  those  with good taste  and  reject  those

which  are  down-right pornographic. In condemning

all  Western and foreign culture, the aim  of  the

Communists was to create a cultural vacuum in  the

minds  of  the people so that they have no  choice

but  to  accept the Communist cultural values.  We

must rectify that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want is a culture which will instil the

spirit  of  patriotism into our  people  and  fill

their  hearts with pride for our beloved  country.

They  must  not worry too much about the smallness

of  our country and they must be made aware of the

greatness   of   our  achievements.   Culture   is

something vague and abstract. We cannot  feel  nor

smell it, but it is the force that binds all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



people  and makes them into a nation.  It  is  the

force  that  makes all of us want to die  for  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have what the Communists call

"revolutionary  optimism". It  is  true  that  our

country is a small one, but as the Chinese  saying

goes,  even though a sparrow is small it  has  all

the five important organs. And not only do we have

all the important organs but we are also going  to

have some muscles, too. It is true that we have no

natural  resources of our own. But our country  is

so strategically situated that we are able to make

use  of  all  the  resources  from  the  whole  of

Southeast  Asia. It is true that we have  a  small

population - only two million people - and not  many

talents   can   be  extracted  from   this   small

population.  But  we  will  absorb  all  the  best

talents from the whole of Southeast Asia. We  will

not  only give work permits to professional people

and highly skilled workers to work for us, but  we

will  also  allow in the best artistes, musicians,

painters and dancers, so that they can enrich  our

cultural  life.  They will sing  for  our  beloved

country and paint the greatness of our people.  In

return,  we  will  give them  a  position  in  our

society and a future for their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is to allow a free interplay of

cultural forces and not regard culture as  a  mere

instrument  of state. It is in keeping  with  this

principle  that  the Singapore  Arts  Council  was

formed  to provide avenues for cultural expression

as  well  as  to  lead feeling  and  thought  into

purposeful cultural pursuits. In terms  of  actual

programmes,  some  of  the  efforts  of  the  Arts

Council   during  the  last  few  months  included

"Singapore  Night" and "Festival  1968",  to  name

only  a  few.  It  is significant  that  the  Arts

Council,  which comprises all sectors  of  society

and  shades  of opinion, is no monopolist  of  the

performing  arts. Since then there  have  followed

one  hundred  and one performances staged  in  all

parts  of  Singapore to mark our great variety  of

festive  and social occasions, each no  less  than

the other characterised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



by the dominance of local  themes.  In

short, ours is no longer the rootless society that

we  were once characterised to be by other people.

To  change the metaphor, a national culture  in  a

multi-racial  society like ours  is  no  longer  a

theory or an ideal but an actual fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Speech outlined three objectives

-  the  Ministry of Culture will be involved  with

them  -  and  the last more than the others  bears

definite relevance to the Ministry. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Enhancement of national consciousness of the

problems  that will come upon us in the  next  few

years.   We  must  all  learn  to  place  national

interests  above personal or sectional  interests.

Internally,   high   morale   -   internationally,

confidence   in   our  continuing  stability   and

efficiency  - this combination will enable  us  to

achieve new records in high performance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quotation is also an indication of what is in

store for the Ministry of Culture - an accelerated

role in bringing about the change of attitudes  in

our  people. To fulfil this role, the Broadcasting

Division  has  been elevated to  the  level  of  a

Ministry  with  a Permanent Secretary,  and  I  am

happy  to point out that the word "Division"  here

does not have divisive connotations that it has in

its normal context. Far from going different ways,

it  is  that  since one road is too  congested,  a

parallel  road  has  been constructed  for  easier

accessibility  and both roads  lead  to  the  same

objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The targets as outlined in the President's Speech

call  for the establishment of new and necessarily

more  efficient ways of life. In this  connection,

the mass media at the disposal of the Ministry  of

Culture must be brought to bear maximum impact  at

the minimum cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, the policy of my Ministry

will   remain  basically  similar,  although   the

methods may differ by way of innovations and other

devices. In the mass media aspect of our activity,

it is our policy to induce the change of attitudes

in  our  people.  Many  a developing  country  has

rightly  endeavoured to modernise  itself  on  the

basis  of  economic and social transformation  but

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



inadvertently omitted a vital area -the  minds  of

men.   Our  modernisation  process  should   never

neglect attitudinal change in our people and  this

is  where  the  mass  media come  in  to  play  an

essential role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the modern world, our situation is unique. No

other  country  has two million people,  of  multi

ethnic   stock   and   speaking   four   different

languages,  compressed in  an  area  of  only  225

square miles with absolutely no natural resources.

No  other  country  in such a  position  has  been

forced  by geo-politics to have, in such  a  short

time,  not  only vastly to expand its economy  but

also  to  defend its right to retain what  it  has

built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a country and such a society obviously need

more  than the individual talents, drive and  will

of  its  people. Such a society needs organisation

of   the  highest  order.  Such  a  society  needs

leadership   of  the  highest  calibre.   We   are

determined to make our social organisation as best

we  can. To do this, and to do it quickly, we will

need  to  have  the best mass media  that  we  can

afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But people and government, however dedicated and

hard  working, cannot think and work all the time.

Thus,  the  Broadcasting Division, in addition  to

providing  the link and the stimulant,  will  also

provide the diversion and the entertainment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information, education and entertainment are not

mutually exclusive nor antagonistic. Education can

be  entertaining, entertainment can be informative

and information can be educational. How well these

can  be  merged to provide the best programmes  on

the  air depends upon the expertise, the knowledge

and  the dedication of those entrusted with a very

important function. Our task will be to invoke the

dedication, arrange for the knowledge and,  within

our  budget,  provide facilities for  accumulating

expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physically, the most pressing need is a radio

complex.  Our  television  building,  studios  and

equipment are modern.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



But  our radio staff is housed in temporary shacks

built  during  the  time of the  British  Military

Administration. Most of our radio studio equipment

is as old. We hope to replace it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staffing will be a problem for yet some time.

Television  is but a few years old  here.  In  its

creation  and  very rapid development,  the  radio

staff  was  heavily  drawn  upon.  Expertise   was

diluted  in the process of increasing broadcasting

staff   by  four  times  in  five  years  or   so.

Aggravating the problem is the fact that the radio

staff has to learn to operate a different and more

difficult medium. And compounding the difficulties

is  the  fact that when television came, Singapore

had  not  a  well developed electronic  and  film-making  industries. Given present limitations,  it

is  possible, by means of better staff utilisation

and higher morale, to increase output and quality.

This we will do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good entertainment films, especially in the

languages and dialects of most of our people,  are

costly  and  difficult  to obtain.  To  make  them

ourselves  will  cost us more money  than  we  can

afford.  This does not mean that we will not  make

any  films ourselves. It only means that  we  will

have  to  be very prudent and careful in  what  we

make.  We  may  be  able  to  supplement  our  own

production by encouraging other local productions.

We  will  have  to  screen  commercially-sponsored

films so long as they are of good quality and good

taste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since assuming office, I have received many

complaints about the poor presentation of  Chinese

films  in  our TV, programmes. The films  we  used

were more than ten years old and most of them were

repeated twice or even thrice. And I have received

letters from viewers telling me not to project too

many Cantonese films over TV, just because I am  a

Cantonese!  All these boil down to a simple  fact,

and  that  is  we do not have an independent  film

industry in Singapore to produce Chinese films  to

feed  our  T.V. Our only source of film supply  is

Hong  Kong  which produces more films in Cantonese

than in any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



other  dialects.  What is even worse,  these  film

companies  in Hong Kong are controlled by  two  or

three organisations which also run cinema theatres

in  Singapore. Naturally, they do not want T.V. to

present  good programmes that keep the viewers  at

home.  They  would  like  the  viewers  to  be  so

disgusted  with  our programmes that  the  viewers

would  rush  to  patronise their cinemas!  It  is,

therefore, their undeclared policy not to sell  or

hire  to  our  Broadcasting Division  any  Chinese

films of value. If ever they want to hire to us at

all, the film must be more than ten years old. The

same also applies to English and Malay films.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Even to Tamil films.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> So in this situation, it is

quite  difficult  to break their monopoly.  In  my

view, the film organisations are too short-sighted

and  narrow-minded. Over the years,  cinemas  have

competed  successfully  against  T.V. with  their

colour  films, broader screens and better  quality

in  sound  and  music. This  our  T.V. can  never

achieve  for  many years to come, and they  should

have  no  worry  that T.V. will  take  away  their

audience.  So  we  can only  hope  that  the  film

organisations  will  develop  a  more  enlightened

outlook  so that cheap and good entertainment  can

be made available to the common people. Otherwise,

we  will  have to make our own films in Singapore,

but the expenses will be very prohibitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of inducing

attitudinal change in our people as a catalyst  in

social transformation, the various sections of the

Culture Division of my Ministry share amongst them

the other media of mass communication. Utilised in

combination  rather  than in  isolation  as  self-sufficient  units, the effects on  nation-building

can  be far-reaching. Given effective use of  such

mass  media, the targets of our Republic will  and

can  become all the more attainable, and all  that

within a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



much   shorter  period  of  time  too  than  would

otherwise be the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Ministry of Culture will

continue  to  ensure  that Singapore  will  become

culturally distinctive as well as create  a  well-informed and enlightened public, which is a  means

in itself as much as it is a means to a better and

more meaningful life in our multi-racial society.



<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

you  preside over a Parliament that has seen major

milestones  in the political history of  Singapore

after   every  election.  There  have  been   many

elections  in Singapore beginning from 1948,  when

they  were introduced to provide for the  election

of  six  Members  to the Legislative  Council.  In

1955, general elections were held to provide for a

partial transfer of power to the local people.  In

1959,   we  had  advanced  sufficiently  to   have

elections that provided for a substantial transfer

of power to a wholly elected Legislative Assembly.

The result of that general elections was a victory

for  the PAP. In September 1963, we as a party had

already  made Singapore history by being the  only

party   ever  to  be  returned  to  power   twice.

Recently,  we  created yet more records  in  being

returned to power for a third term and in  forming

the   first   elected  Government  of  a   totally

independent and sovereign Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, it is the current record

that  I wish to dwell upon for a few minutes,  and

this  is  the unique situation, both for Singapore

and,  indeed,  for  the practice of  parliamentary

democracy, that we the P.A.P. occupy every  single

seat in this Parliament. Nowhere else in the world

where  parliamentary democracy  is  practised  has

such a situation arisen. That this is the case  is

less the result of a choice by the electorate than

the  failure  of opposition parties to  provide  a

credible  alternative to the P.A.P. It would  have

been in the national interest if we had had widely

contested elections in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



which the support of the communal, Right-wing  and

pro-Communist parties could have been measured  in

quantitative  terms. Perhaps they would  not  have

lost  every single seat, but I have no doubt  that

they  would  have suffered a decisive defeat.  The

defeat   of   the  communal  parties  would   have

demonstrated the futility of politics based on the

narrow appeals of race and culture. The defeat  of

the  Right-wing parties would have driven home the

point that they have alienated themselves from the

people   of   Singapore   and   have   emasculated

themselves by their own inadequacies. Finally, the

defeat  of  the  Communist front Barisan  Sosialis

would   have  revealed  its  degeneration   as   a

political force due to rigid adherence to policies

which  have  no  relevance in the context  of  the

present political situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some people who feel that it

seems  somehow not right that the P.A.P. have  all

58   seats.  Under  the  system  of  parliamentary

democracy  such  as  we  have  inherited,  it   is

possible  for  a  political party to  contest  the

elections  and  to  lose every  single  seat,  and

equally for it to win every single seat. In  1963,

we  saw the Singapore People's Alliance lose every

single seat it contested. Now, in 1968, we see the

P.A.P. win every seat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not very likely that there will be another

such  Parliament, and the return  of  a  political

Opposition, preferably a bona fide democratic one,

will be for the political welfare of Singapore. It

will make Parliament a more lively and, certainly,

a  more  abrasive place for its Members. But  more

important, it will ensure the institutionalisation

of   parliamentary  democracy   as   a   form   of

government.  If  the return of  an  Opposition  is

almost   wholly   or  wholly  a  resurrection   of

Communist  front parties, whether in the  form  of

the Barisan Sosialis or other organisations guided

by  other  variants of Communism,  then  Singapore

will be moving into more difficult times. For this

will  be  the tangible verdict of the  failure  of

this Parliament to cope adequately and effectively

with the major problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



outlined  in  precise  and concise  terms  by  the

President  of Singapore in his Speech on  6th  May

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, indeed all of Southeast Asia, is in a

state  of  change  so rapid as  to  awe  even  the

historian.  We  live  in a region  where  dramatic

changes  have been the order of the day since  the

last  World War. There are powers which  must,  in

the  nature  of  things, calculate  the  direction

which  Singapore  politics will take,  within  the

context  of their rivalry in Southeast Asia.  Some

of  these not only have an interest in us but also

possess   both  the  will  and  the  capacity   to

influence,  in  overt or, as is  more  likely,  in

subtle  but tangible ways, the development of  the

region.  What is required of this Parliament  then

is  more than good and effective government  which

any  electorate rightfully expects of its  elected

representatives. It has also to demonstrate in  no

uncertain manner to those at home and abroad,  who

wish us well or ill, that this Government and  the

people of Singapore have the determination and the

ability  to  create a stable and  enduring  multi-racial  nation in a troublous part of the  Pacific

Basin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine years of imaginative and constructive

efforts  have  gone  into  the  building  of   our

prosperous  multi-racial  society.  But   economic

prosperity cannot be our only goal. Singapore  has

throughout  its  history enjoyed  high  levels  of

prosperity,  despite occasional setbacks.  In  the

past, Singapore flourished even though the various

races  had relatively little to do with each other

and  certainly did not feel as the people  of  one

nation.  Singapore will not endure solely  on  the

foundations  of  multi-storeyed flats,  factories,

and;  all  the  tangible evidence of a  prosperous

economy. A rise in the Gross National Product,  so

essential  for  our  national  survival  and   the

objective of good government, is helpful  for  its

cushioning  effects  in the competition  for  jobs

between  the communities, but it is not the  long-term answer to bring about a cohesive society  out

of our diverse races. The answer lies in continued

efforts to create the kind of society that will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



able to cope with the stresses and strains of life

in  Asia.  To  ensure this, the basic multi-racial

philosophy   of  our  society  must   become   the

framework  on  which our people rationalise  their

daily and national existence. And so, if our multi-racial  society  is to endure, it cannot  be  only

because  of  the words and actions  of  58  P.A.P.

Members  of Parliament. It must be the  result  of

the  collective will of every single man and woman

in  Singapore who believes that multi-racialism is

the  only  rational way of life  in  the  kind  of

society we have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Mr Speaker, Sir, gone a long way to

institutionalise multi-racialism as a way of life.

We  have rightly placed our emphasis on youth  and

education,  based on the integration of  the  four

language  streams and the production of  bilingual

students.   But  languages  are  just   media   of

communication, and by themselves do not  serve  to

unite  unless the content of education is  infused

with the values of our society. This involves more

than just a change in the curricula to bring about

a  re-orientation of attitudes. Equally important,

those who teach the curricula must understand  and

believe in the grand design.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please permit me, Mr Speaker, Sir, to cite a

personal  experience to illustrate  my  point.  My

eldest  boy  is in the equivalent of a  Primary  1

class  in  Washington. One day,  after  about  six

months in this school, he came home to explain  to

me  why  George  Washington's birthday  was  being

observed.  Can we say for certain that our  school

systems are so developed that, in a similar period

of  time,  a child in his first year of  education

can,  with  earnest  enthusiasm,  explain  to  his

parents why our National Day should be celebrated?

No  definitive  answer can be expected  without  a

proper  systematic evaluation involving the  whole

field of education. Perhaps in the proposed effort

to   improve  the  qualitative  character  of  our

educational system consideration can be  given  to

the    inclusion    of   an   investigation    and

recommendation of what can be done  to  inspire  a

teacher to give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



his  students more than just the format  substance

of  their  education. Perhaps;  it  is  time  that

serious thought should be given to a comprehensive

evaluation of almost one decade of effort that has

been  put  in  the field of education towards  the

objective  of  a  multi-racial society,  with  the

object  of determining both the factors that  have

promoted  or  retarded progress, so  that  further

development can be set into motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multi-racial society can only be nurtured and

sustained   by   a   multi-racial  intelligentsia,

reflecting the character of the population. So  it

is a logical development of our educational policy

that  the  universities and other institutions  of

higher  learning-should  become  an  integral  and

vital   part  of  the  national  community.   The-desirability   of  a  Minister  of   Science   and

Technology, who is also simultaneously  the  Vice-Chancellor  of  the University of  Singapore,  may

disturb the intellectual equilibrium of those  who

hold   an   inflexible  doctrinal  view  of   what

constitutes   academic  freedom   and   university

autonomy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, if one were to undertake serious research

into the subject one would discover that there has

never  been a relationship between the  State  and

the university which has not undergone changes  in

response  to environmental changes. An examination

of  the  constitutional and conventional relations

between  State and universities brings  forth  the

fact  that  friction between them is at a  minimum

where   there  is  a  common  consensus  of  basic

fundamental  values  and  loyalties  to   society.

Issues  are  defined, discussed, and  disposed  of

from  the  focal  point of what is  best  for  the

community as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present position of the University of

Singapore  reflects  in  the  last  analysis   the

failure  of the academic community as a  whole  to

adapt itself to the radical changes that have come

to  pass  in  Singapore in the  last  decade.  The

appointment  of a Vice-Chancellor  who-is  also  a

Senior   Cabinet  Minister,  notwithstanding   his

reputation  as an academic man, is an  indictment.

Yet, in extenuation, perhaps it must be admitted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



that many of the academic community  are  not

our  nationals and cannot be expected  to  concern

themselves with our affairs. It will be a  tragedy

for  the  development of our intellectual life  if

there  is  no  room in the University for  foreign

professors  and teachers to provide the  necessary

stimuli.  But, in the main, the direction  of  the

University  must be in the hands of nationals.  It

is  to  be  hoped,  and  I  am  both  hopeful  and

optimistic,  that the present unusual appointment,

the  product of extraordinary circumstances, shall

be  a  passing  phase  in the  history  of  higher

education  in  Singapore. For if such  a  practice

were  to develop into a permanent feature, it will

be  a reflection of the continuing failure of  the

University to get itself identified, and, what  is

even  more  important, accepted  as  part  of  our

national life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imminent recognition of Nanyang University

degrees  reminds  us  of how  much  progress  this

institution  has  made  in educational  and  other

terms   within  the  framework  of  our   national

community. It is to be hoped that at some point of

its evolution, it will achieve the same measure of

institutional  recognition as  the  University  of

Singapore   in  the  international  community   of

learning.  If our polyglot society is  to  achieve

national cohesion, the linguistic cleavages,  born

out  of  colonial times and now in the process  of

being bridged in our school system, should not  be

allowed  to  persist longer than is  educationally

feasible in the institutions of higher learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the designation of the

Minister for Science and Technology is the  result

of the necessity to emphasize the national need to

develop  a  hitherto  neglected  aspect   of   our

education   rather   than  a   reflection   of   a

fundamental  change in attitude  on  the  part  of

Government  towards higher education in  the  arts

and  social sciences. The urgent national need  to

develop  a  technological  and  scientific   class

indispensable  to  an industrialising  society  is

beyond   question  and  requires  constant  public

reiteration. Yet it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



well   to   remember  that  the  main  burden   of

preserving, refining, and developing the  cultural

life of a nation falls on the shoulders of the non-technological  and non-scientific members  of  the

intelligentsia.  We  have  need  to  continue   to

develop the arts and social sciences, and, what is

even more relevant, to nurture a self-perpetuating

generation of bilingual intelligentsia capable  of

sustaining  our  society and  having  the  broader

perspective of viewing our problems on the broader

base of a multi-racial community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to touch on a specific topic of

interest to all Singaporeans. This is the National

Museum.  Its re-organisation is long overdue.  The

proposal to transform it (to quote the Addendum to

the  Presidential  Speech)  into  "an  educational

centre   displaying  in  vivid  manner  the   rich

political, social, and economic history  not  only

of  Singapore but of the whole region of which  we

are the fulcrum" is, I think, an imaginative step.

In  developing  the  historical  sections  of  the

National   Museum,  the  role   of   the   various

communities,  their  leaders,  and  Sir   Stamford

Raffles  should not be forgotten. For the colonial

past is as much a part of our national history  as

the  eventful future will be. But what is required

is  more  than  a transformation of  the  National

Museum  in the manner proposed. A section  devoted

to the portrayal of the development of science and

technology  will  contribute in a significant  way

towards  encouraging  the  growth  of  minds  more

receptive to the perquisites of an industrialising

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, Mr Speaker, we will be celebrating

the  150th  anniversary  of  Singapore.  Doubtless

there  will be many national celebrations. I would

like  to  recommend for the consideration of  this

Government the erection of a monument in memory of

our   nameless  and,  often,  penniless  immigrant

ancestors  whose sweat and toil turned the  swamps

of  Singapore into the solid foundation  that  has

made it possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



for  us to build a better future for ourselves and

our  children. We have cenotaphs to  remember  our

dead,  named  or nameless, in the two World  Wars.

Other  countries remember their Unknown  Soldiers.

So why should we not set up, with public donations

and  governmental encouragement, some  appropriate

national  monument for the Unknown  Immigrants  to

remind   this  and  future  generations   of   our

immigrant  origins and the progress we have  made,

and will continue to make, in nationhood?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a passion for progress, probably the most

intense  and most purposeful in this part  of  the

world.  We fill up swamps to put up factories  and

the  sea to increase the size of our country,  and

we  knock down old buildings to make way for  tall

impressive  residential and commercial  ones.  But

this passion for progress should not be allowed to

erase  completely the past. In a  country  with  a

long  colonial history and no monuments of ancient

civilisation  to  remind  us  of   our   past   in

Singapore,  it  will serve a national  purpose  to

preserve some old sections of our city, historical

buildings,  churches,  mosques,  and  temples,  as

abiding reminders of the immigrant origins of  our

nation, and as a visual measure of the progress we

have  made,  and  will continue  to  make  in  the

modernisation  and consolidation  of  our  nation.

There  are even substantial monetary gains  to  be

derived in preserving something of the past. As we

change  the  face of Singapore, as  we  inevitably

must,  we  should  also leave some  things  of  an

exotic  character for the tourists  so  that  they

will  have  more to see than just how a determined

and  resourceful population, with application  and

ambition,  has  brought about  a  modern  thriving

Asian  city-state into the world  of  science  and

technology.   It   is  in  the  light   of   these

considerations that I regard with a  critical  eye

the   efforts   at  urban  renewal.   A   National

Historical Commission, with the authority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



to identify the historical aspect of our past that

is  relevant to our evolution towards multi-racial

nationhood,  should be seriously considered  as  a

desirable creation to advise the Government in its

urban  renewal  programmes and  its  plan  to  re-organise  the  National  Museum  into  a  national

educational exhibition centre. I believe  we  have

qualified people for such a Commission,  and  some

have  organised themselves recently into a History

Association of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I began on a note about the

political  desirability and inevitability  of  the

return of an Opposition in this Parliament. I also

stressed   the  desirability  of   a   bona   fide

democratic Opposition. What is even more desirable

and  relevant  is  that  the  return  of  such  an

Opposition  will  take  the  shape  of   political

parties   that   subscribe  to   the   fundamental

philosophy  of  multi-racialism.  We  have  now  a

Parliament   that  reflects  unanimity   on   this

concept.  We  should not miss this opportunity  to

consolidate  the  institutional arrangements  that

make   for  the  perpetuation  of  this  political

philosophy as the national order of life.  Let  me

commend   to   my  parliamentary  colleagues   the

practical  wisdom of a great poet who wrote  in  a

language  this  nation has  the  common  sense  to

accept as one of its official languages:



<pre>

            "On such a full sea are we now afloat,

             And we must take the current when it serves,

             Or lose our ventures." (Shakespeare,  Julius Caesar, Act 4, Scene III).

</pre>



<br><br>6.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we have heard divergent views and criticisms

by hon. Members of the House for the last two days

in  their replies to the President's Speech at the

Opening  of  the  Parliament. Some  who  delivered

their speeches were making their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



debut  in Parliament. In this respect, Sir,  I  am

one of those who are making their maiden speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not in a position to reply to some of the

references made by one or two of our hon.  Members

to  my  Ministry, as I have been appointed  to  my

present office only a few days ago. I therefore do

not  intend  to  reply but shall leave  it  to  my

colleague, the hon. Member for Stamford, and to my

Minister,  who has already dealt with  certain  of

the matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I propose to speak on in the next 30 or 35

minutes  is  a subject on which none  has  touched

before, although reference has been made here  and

there.  I  am  referring to  the  third  objective

outlined   in   the  President's   Speech,   i.e.,

"enhancement  of  national  consciousness  of  the

problems  that will come upon us in the  next  few

years." I consider this objective as important  as

the  other  two in creating a modern,  democratic,

multi-racial Singapore which is our national goal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are all aware, in the Addendum to the

President's Speech, when outlining the policies of

the various Ministries as a whole, he said, in his

reference  to the Ministry of Culture,  that  T.V.

and  Radio  would  be  elevated  into  a  separate

division with a separate Permanent Secretary. This

step  is  taken  in view of the greater  and  more

effective role our T.V, and Radio has to play  "to

inform,  entertain  and  educate".  It  will  also

stimulate   loyalty   and   patriotism   and   the

importance of increased productivity in order that

the  Republic  will be able to pull through  these

difficult  years. I have not the slightest  doubt,

in   the  light  of  the  ability  shown  by   our

leadership in the past, that we shall be  able  to

surmount every difficulty, provided every  one  of

us  - those in the Government and the people adopt

the  right  attitude. It is to adopt this  correct

attitude in facing the problems ahead of  us  that

T.V, and  Radio  must play its  due  role.  Every

community in this island-Republic of ours, whether

it be Malay, Chinese,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



Indian,  Eurasian, European or other  communities,

must be made to realise that it is part of a multi-racial Singapore and that it has a role to play in

contributing towards the success of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow any community to lag behind in

this rat-race for survival, otherwise it will have

to  face problems which are bound to create a  lot

of  social unrest in the years ahead. Thus, it  is

very  vital that no community should feel that  it

is  being  discriminated against, for  it  is  the

Government's  policy to accord equal treatment  to

everybody.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this right  attitude

and  thinking  is vital in order  to  achieve  our

national  goal  - that of creating a  multi-racial

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now dwell on the subject of national

integration which I think can well be instrumental

in achieving the third objective as set out in the

President's Speech. I feel the people must be made

to  feel  as  one  people before we  can  proceed.

Without  this solidarity through consolidation  of

effort  and the pooling of resources, it would  be

impossible  to  achieve the other two  objectives,

namely,   greater  economic  growth   and   higher

productivity and adequate defence capability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what do we mean when we speak of national

integration?   One  definition  is  the   bringing

together of the disparate parts of society into  a

more cohesive whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several approaches to this problem and

whatever the techniques that we have used  in  the

past, we should not deviate from our bearings  and

objectives.  We  know, too, that this  process  of

creating a multi-racial Singapore and the sense of

being Singaporeans will take at least a generation

before we can really see the fruits of our labour.

But believe me, Sir, our integrated system both in

the  schools  and in the Army has  attracted  both

attention and criticism from experts all over  the

world.  I  know  we  have to  be  patient  in  any

experiment that we have undertaken and should  not

expect to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



see  the  results overnight. Sir, we  should  give

credit to those who have been responsible for  the

planning, for they have done a marvellous job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been described as the melting-pot

of  three great cultures -namely, Chinese,  Indian

and  Malay -and it has attracted a lot of tourists

whose desire is to see the exotic Eastern cultures

in  their various manifestations. Our Government's

cultural policy is to create a blend of the  three

but  with  a  typically Singaporean flavour,  with

some  European pepper here and there  to  make  it

feel   hot.  Thus,  in  the  process  of  national

integration, we have to integrate our cultures  so

as  to  be  able  to evolve our own  identity  and

character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the subject of national

integration,  our motto should be - Unity  through

Diversity. The people of Singapore, who come  from

various ethnic groups, find their real loyalty and

sense of oneness not within the nation as yet, for

Singapore  is still in the process of  creating  a

nation,  but  within their special  small  ethnic,

language or religious groups. National integration

will  lead to a drawing together of these  diverse

elements  into something more cohesive,  with  the

parts  linked more closely together. The trend  to

be foreseen is aptly described by the phrase "from

many small societies to one large society."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this while, Sir, our leaders and hon. Members

have  been  making speeches urging the  people  to

live   as  a  united  people  and  stressing   the

importance  of  unity amongst  people  of  various

races  and  religions, which make up our  polyglot

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see the difference in attire worn by girls

of  various  races - the Malays  in  their  sarong

kebayas,   the   Chinese  in   their   tantalising

cheongsams  and  the  Indians in  their  beautiful

saris. With the latest craze for mini-skirts,  our

youths  seem to be falling for this type of dress.

However, what I am trying to suggest is that these

visual contrasts between Malays, Chinese, Indians



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



and  others are only superficial differences  that

make  up  our mosaic society, made up of countless

pieces, each neatly defined and separated from all

the others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in this House is familiar with language

conflicts in other countries. India has  over  200

languages.  Even  Nepal,  with  only  10   million

people,  has six substantial language  groups.  In

Ghana,  with  only 7.5 million people,  there  are

more   than  five  major  languages.  Yet  we   in

Singapore have well adapted ourselves to  speaking

the  four  official  languages besides  using  the

National   Language  and  our  respective   mother

tongue.  Fellow-feeling is  difficult  to  develop

when language differences isolate one another. But

this  is not the case in Singapore where everyone,

whether  he is Chinese or Indian, is able to  make

himself  understood  through  the  use  of  bazaar

Malay, which is the lingua franca in this part  of

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said earlier that the Army is one

important  nationalising agent putting  our  young

men    through   strenuous   training   in   which

differences of ethnic background, religion, and so

on are minimised and where men are infused with  a

patriotic  zeal for the nation. In  this  respect,

those responsible for the training of our national

servicemen  and  the  Army should  be  given  full

commendation for the wonderful job they are  doing

in  turning out rugged young men equipped not only

with  military skills for armed combat  but,  more

important   still,  imbued  with  the  spirit   of

patriotism   and   public   spiritedness,    self-discipline  and a high standard of  integrity.  It

will  be wonderful to watch in the not too distant

future,  disciplined  young men  taking  over  the

leadership  not only in the Army but also  in  all

spheres of activity and organisation. One  day  we

can be assured that all the efforts put in by both

the Government and us will bring heavy dividends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other approach is through our school system

through  the  integrated educational policy  which

has  indeed  not  only been instilling  a  growing

sense of national identity into our children but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



also  inculcating in them the spirit of  the  true

Singaporean.  The suggestion put  forward  by  the

hon.  Member  for Joo Chiat last Friday  that  all

communal  schools  should be abolished  should  be

given  serious thought if we are really to achieve

our   objective.  The  Government   has   recently

announced that the integrated policy has now  been

extended  to  missionary schools, and the  schools

which are untouched are those which are completely

privately  financed and over which the  Government

has no say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and most effective approach, I think,

is  by  accommodating peoples  of  various  races,

status and background under the same roof,  so  to

speak. Peoples from different walks of life,  such

as   civil  servants,  businessmen,  the  squatter

farmers who have been resettled, etc., are brought

together as one community. There can be no  faster

way  of changing the attitude and mentality of the

people  and,  at the same time, modernising  their

way of life. At the moment, nearly a quarter of  a

million  of  the population are living in  Housing

Board  flats  in Queenstown and other  areas,  and

very soon the new Toa Payoh satellite town will be

ready for use. More and more people will have  the

opportunity of living in these flats. I  think  we

can achieve our national integration by making the

people live in this urbanised society of flats. It

is  through  constant personal contact and  inter-action that they have come to live as a people and

in  this  respect  I  must give  the  Housing  and

Development  Board a pat on the back  for  putting

Singapore's  reputation  high  on  the   list   of

countries that have solved their national  housing

problems. Praiseworthy comments have been made  by

experts  from  all over the world on  our  housing

achievements and I can confidently say, Sir,  that

this  feeling of pride should be implanted in  the

minds  of our people, that although Singapore  may

be  small  in terms of space, it has evolved  many

good  ideas  and set examples to the rest  of  the

world on how we tackle the many problems facing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



this  country  by careful planning, thinking  and

intelligent action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to share our expertise and know-how with any country which cares to seek our

advice.  We hope in the near future to export  not

only commodities which now are getting well known,

but most probably also our human made-in-Singapore

expertise  to  help  other  countries   in   their

development programmes. In fact, we are already  a

donor  country under the Colombo Plan by  offering

scholarships and training courses in the field  of

telecommunications, etc. Thus, by the use of human

resources and with proper leadership, we have  not

only  achieved  for ourselves a high  standard  of

living  but  we are also able to help  others  who

require  our  services. In fact, we  have  already

sent a team of housing experts to Christmas Island

at  the invitation of the Australian Government to

give  the  benefit of our experience  in  low-cost

housing to the people there. Endeavours like this,

Sir,  help to project Singapore's image abroad.  I

think  it is very important that we inculcate  the

spirit  of national pride in our children and  our

people. They must be made to realise that if  they

want  to see this state of affairs continue,  they

must play their part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now elaborate on the

role  of T.V, and Radio in creating a multi-racial

outlook.   All  over  the  world,  it   has   been

statistically  discovered  that  individuals   and

villagers who have access to the printed  word  or

the  radio medium have more modern attitudes,  are

much  more  progressive, and are in a position  to

play more positive roles than those who are denied

access  to  these mass communication  media.  This

shows how important the mass media are in changing

the  people's attitudes. Even in the communication

system of highly developed societies, there  is  a

complex interaction between the modern mass  media

system  and  the traditional mode of interpersonal

by-word-of-mouth communication. A  modern  society

is  not  an amorphous depersonalised mass  society

free from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



primary  groups.  It  is an elaborated  system  of

families, clubs, ethnic groups, classes, political

organisations and friendship groupings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dissemination of any new idea or practice in

such  a  society depends not only on the publicity

it  is  given  through the mass  media,  but  also

through conversations and discussions on topics by

the  people face to face. That is why the  setting

up of Citizens' Consultative Committees in all the

constituencies  has bridged the  gap  between  the

Government  and  the  people.  In  this  way,  the

Government   encourages   participation   by    an

identification  with  the  citizenry.   All   hon.

Members appreciate the services of these people in

the Citizens' Consultative Committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know full well, Sir, that mass media alone can

have profound effects on what people pay attention

to,  the  information they have, their taste,  and

their impressions of the world. On the other hand,

the mass media by themselves are less effective in

changing  attitudes or efforts towards  action.  I

have  noted several hon. Members making references

to the need to change the attitude and thinking of

the  people  if  we hope to survive the  difficult

years ahead of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of changing and influencing

attitudes,  as everyone knows, is rather  complex.

The  trouble is that most people have rather  weak

or ill-defined attitudes. I believe that something

can  be  done to change the attitude of our people

through  the  use of our Radio and T.V. in  their

programmes.  But  Radio  and  T.V. alone   cannot

achieve  this  target in the absence  of  personal

reinforcement.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   if   I   can

remember,  the  Member for Katong  has  said  that

besides  Radio and T.V., adult education  agencies

can  also  be  brought into  play  to  change  the

people's attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get people to act in ways that conform to new

values  requires that mass media of  communication

be reinforced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



by the personal touch. We must try to reach

people from all walks of life, if possible at  the

grass-root level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to create a democratic, modern and

multi-racial  Singapore, and it is essential  that

every  community  in the Republic,  be  it  Malay;

Chinese,  Indian, Eurasian, etc., should have  the

right attitude towards the problems in the crucial

years  ahead  brought  about  by  the  accelerated

British  withdrawal from Singapore. The  problems,

as  they  are now, may be small but in  the  1970s

they  may  rise to such a magnitude that  we  will

have  to  face very rough times. As I said earlier

just  now, we can attack these problems by a  two-pronged approach - via Radio and T.V, and other mass

media   of  communication'  and  through  personal

reinforcement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore being small in size, is advantageous

for the practice of mass media of communication to

the  masses. Thus, it is important that we  should

make  our  people problem-orientated and  problem-conscious. When their thinking is geared to  this,

then they will be able to adapt themselves to  the

situation when the time comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are moving towards a technological

society  and in such a society we want our  people

to   be   not  only  scientific-minded  but   also

analytical and critical in their outlook. This can

only  come  about  if  they participate  in  group

discussions  on  the  problems  facing  Singapore.

Thus, it is very important that our Radio and T.V.

and   other  mass  media  of  communication   like

newspapers  and magazines be injected  with  ideas

that will stimulate the thinking and instil in the

people   a   sense   of  patriotism   and   public

spiritedness  and  the  importance  of   increased

productivity. Small dosages of medicine, if  taken

every  day, will have beneficial curative effects.

Similarly,  through the media of  Radio  and  T.V.

programmes,  ideas  could  be  infused  into   the

dramas,, forums, guest-of-the-week programmes, and

so  on.  It  is only through constant and  regular

programmes   of  this  nature  that  people   will

gradually accept new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



ideas.   Such  programmes  should  be   aimed   at

equipping  the  people to meet the new  challenges

ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now dwell on the

objectives  set out in the President's Speech  not

yet  touched on by my colleagues both on the Front

benches  and Back benches. I would like  to  quote

what the President said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must all learn to place national interest

above personal or sectional interest.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, Sir, that this third objective

has  a  special  relevance  to  the  question   of

changing  the attitudes of the people.  Unless  we

effectively reorientate the thinking of our people

to  the  problems that lie ahead, we  can  achieve

very  little by way of implementing the other  two

objectives.  In  the  closing  paragraphs  of  his

speech,  the  President said that he would  expect

hon.  Members to speak in forthright terms to lend

more  importance to lead thinking and  feeling  in

the   country,   and  to  ensure   that   everyone

understands the challenge and gives of his best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his speech on the opening

of  Parliament, in congratulating you on your  re-election to the Chair, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...under your guidance, this House will keep the

parliamentary  machine in  good  shape,  and  also

sustain  and cultivate the attitudes of  tolerance

and calculated deference to opposing views.'



<br><br>For  the  last  two days, I have heard  criticisms

levelled    against   Government    policies    by

Backbenchers, who in fact are playing the role  of

the  Opposition.  The position  of  our  one-party

Parliament  in  Singapore  by  consent  is  rather

unique. There are countries in Afro-Asia where the

temptation    is    to   establish    single-party

constitution   tendencies.  Some  countries   have

evolved  political  parties  whose  major  purpose

appears  to  be to moderate communal,  ethnic  and

other  conflicts,  without  insisting  on  a  full

monopoly  of power. Certain parties, such  as  the

Alliance of Malaysia, the Congress Party in India,

and  the  Party  of Revolutionary  Institution  in

Mexico, consciously subscribe to the integrated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



system of politics. These political Parties

contain a number of diverse and often competing

groups.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>6.23 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Prime Minister's Speech, he expressed the

hope  that one day the Opposition would  and  must

inevitably return. Before that day comes, we,  the

P.A.P., within ourselves in this House are already

creating  this "Opposition" group in the  form  of

the   Backbenchers.   Although   this   form    of

Opposition, as the Prime Minister observed, is not

the   same  real  Opposition  that  he   and   his

colleagues experienced in the fifties and sixties,

nevertheless the new Back-benchers who represent a

wide cross-section of our society will undoubtedly

be  able to keep the parliamentary machine  going.

We  must  let the whole world know that  the  one-party  system  that we have today in Singapore  is

merely  an  electoral  accident  and  not  because

democracy  is dead, as some have said. During  the

last  general  elections  the  Opposition  parties

could  not win a single seat. The sweeping victory

by  the  P.A.P, in the seven contested  seats  was

clear  testimony of the faith and  confidence  the

people  have  in  the present Government.  We  can

prove  to  the world that the one-party Parliament

in Singapore provides an absorbing study for those

who  are  interested in doing  research  into  the

political upheaval in Singapore which, as has been

said,   is  unique  and  unprecedented  in   world

history.  I observe that not many people  take  an

interest  in  parliamentary proceedings.  This,  I

again attribute to the attitude of our people  who

take  things for granted. However, I am sure, that

Members on the opposite Benches will take heed  of

what  the  President said, that they should  speak

their minds freely and forcefully and provide  the

lead in their thinking and feeling in the country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the overwhelming support given by the

people in returning all the 58 seats to the P.A.P.

clearly  shows  that we have the  support  of  the

masses.  The present leadership, with the addition

of   new   Members,  will  work  hard  to   uphold

parliamentary democracy in Singapore and,  at  the

same  time,  give the people security,  peace  and

prosperity. I would like to make an appeal to  the

leaders of all the communities in the Republic  to

sink  their differences and work together to  make

multi-racial Singapore a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure whatever complaints the people have can

always   be   voiced  through  their  Members   of

Parliament in the various constituencies and they,

in turn, can voice them in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malays, in particular, also have a

contribution  to make towards the success  of  our

multi-racial  society and of democratic  socialism

in  Singapore.  They must not feel that  they  are

isolated  or are being excluded. They must  change

their  attitude and reorientate their thinking  to

suit  the  changes  that are taking  place  around

them.  They must not live in the world of fantasy.

We   want  our  Malay  community  to  have   every

opportunity to train and equip themselves to  face

the  challenge  for  an industrialised  Singapore.

These efforts will succeed only if the Malays have

the  right spirit to face the challenge  to  work,

study  and train themselves in order to  face  the

world  in  the future. They should not worry  over

trifling matters which will bring no benefits. The

Government is giving every assistance to  all  the

Malays  in  the Republic as provided  for  in  the

Constitution -especially in the field of education

-and they must make full use of the facilities and

opportunities  that  are  available  to  them   to

improve themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said, "We are living in a

society which from day to day assumes a more urban

and  industrialised character." In  the  next  few

years with the rapid development in urban renewal,

construction of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



flyovers  and other building complexes,  Singapore

will  be  transformed into one of the most dynamic

cities in this part of the world and will be  able

to  maintain  a  high standard of living  for  its

people. It has already become a Utopia - a land of

plenty.   By   Asian   standards,   Singapore   is

prosperous, but this affluence does not mean  that

any   part  of  the  society  can  afford  to   be

inefficient or adopt lackadaisical attitudes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the lack of corruption in this Republic has

made Singapore one of the few countries which have

a  clean government. Our people have not only come

to  expect  efficient  and intelligent  officials,

they   have  also  come  to  understand   that   a

democratically  elected government  can  and  will

eliminate corrupt practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, Sir, this has contributed to the

image of a democratically elected government as an

effective  servant  which,  in  the  process,  can

maintain  high  standards  of  conduct,  and   has

dismissed  the attractiveness of more totalitarian

approaches  to discipline as the sine qua  non  of

progress.  It  has meant that political  opponents

must be policy oriented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next five years will, in all probability,

determine  if Singapore will continue to  have  an

Opposition  or  will move towards a modified  one-party system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay community must remain part of the

growth  and  development of every  aspect  of  the

social,  political and economic life of Singapore.

They  must develop self-reliance so that  one  day

they  too can stand on their own feet and  compete

with  the  others.  They must identify  themselves

with  the symbol of progress as Singapore  Malays.

They  must not say that religion hinders  progress

since  Islam  teaches us to be diligent,  to  work

hard,  to  strive, for nothing is  free.  All  the

opportunities for improvement are before them  and

it is up to them to take full advantage. They must

not have the false idea adopted by some of the so-called "leaders" that the Government wishes to  do

away with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



the  Malay language just because the two secondary

schools are going to be integrated. Even a  Member

of  the  Malaysian Parliament, Inche Khir  Johari,

Minister  for  Education, in many of his  speeches

recently,   has   indicated   that   he    favours

integration and the use of English in the teaching

of   Science   and  Mathematics  in   Malay-medium

schools.  Let us be realists. It is no use  trying

to  hide  something bad and later on it  is  found

that it is too late to do anything. The earlier we

have  the change in our school system, the  better

it  will be for the generations that are to  come.

That is why the Government is doing all it can  to

have  the reorganisation of secondary schools  and

re-siting of the Universities to avoid duplication

of  work, so that maximum advantage can be derived

from  such  changes  which will  in  turn  benefit

Singapore.  They  must  not  think  in  terms   of

sectional interests, for this kind of thinking  is

not   healthy   in  the  context  of  multi-racial

Singapore. They must not be introspective in their

thinking,  for  this  will only  make  them  slide

further  back  into  the past.  They  must  be  as

forward-looking as the others and they  should  be

proud  of their mini-Singapore which may be  small

in  size  but not in spirit or wealth. It  is  the

spirit  of oneness and sense of togetherness  that

the leaders must inculcate in the Malay community.

They must also instil in them a sense of pride and

unity.  Let  us all work together to  achieve  the

common  national goal of creating  a  multi-racial

Singapore.



<br><br>6.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, over the last few days, Members of the

House  have  raised  a number of  questions  about

sports,  including  how the National  Stadium  can

contribute to making our society a robust one  and

how  the stadium will not become a white elephant.

They  have  also raised the point of  insufficient

attention  being paid to badminton and whether  we

should  consider  introducing  an  air-conditioned

Badminton  Hall  in  the National  Sports  Stadium

Complex.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the economic challenges posed in the

years ahead, it is necessary for our people to  be

physically  fit  and have a greater  capacity  for

endurance.  This physical ruggedness can  best  be

achieved through competitive and community sports.

Although  it  is a recognised fact  that  sporting

activities help to build stamina, sports  is  also

known  to  engender  a strong  sense  of  national

pride. The twin objectives of a rugged society and

national  pride will therefore be  served  in  our

multi-society  through  active  encouragement   of

sports.



<br><br>6.39 p.m.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have three

advantages  on  our  side  in  creating   such   a

physically  rugged  society.  The  first  is   the

youthfulness of our population, making them easily

adaptable to respond to the challenges ahead;  the

second  advantage  is  the high  standard  of  our

health  services;  and the third  is  the  compact

character   of  our  island  State   making   easy

accessibility to any service or facility  that  is

provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The active encouragement of sports activities

planned by the Ministry of Social Affairs includes

the setting up of a proper co-ordinating committee

for  sports.  At present, there are too  many  co-ordinating  committees with overlapping functions.

Some of these committees will be abolished and the

new one that will be created will include not only

representatives  of the Olympic Council  but  also

representatives of the Ministry of Education,  the

Sports Division of the Ministry of Social Affairs,

the  Army, the Police Force and also the  People's

Association. Encouragement will also be  given  to

individual   sports  organisations  to  reorganise

themselves  to  get  the  services  of   dedicated

officials  in their committees, so that  sustained

efforts  can  be  made to improve  the  individual

games concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides organisation, another plan is to get

proper  coaches  for the various games  played  in

Singapore. A beginning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



has  been made to get expert coaches. So far,  the

services  of four coaches have been obtained.  The

Bulgarian  coach for football arrived in  November

1967   and  the  Bulgarian  coach  for  basketball

arrived  in April this year. The volleyball  coach

arrived from Japan in April 1968. The services of,

Singapore's  past  badminton champion,"  Mr  Wong

Peng  Soon, have been obtained as badminton coach.

He  started operations as from February this  year

and  has  gathered a group of potential first-rate

players who will be put to centralised training on

a  systematic  basis in preparation for  the  next

Thomas Cup competition. Arrangements are also made

for  a  Japanese swimming coach to come and  train

our  swimmers  to  reach  international  standard.

Similar approaches will be made to get coaches  in

athletics and hockey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for facilities for sports, Members are aware

of the building of the National Stadium Complex at

Kallang. The open stadium, which will hold 50,000,

is  planned to be completed by the end of 1970. As

for  the  indoor stadium, provision has been  made

for  such facilities as gymnastics, table  tennis,

basketball, volley ball, sepak takraw (or what  we

call sepak raga faring), and badminton. There will

be  separate  facilities for swimming, ice-skating

and tennis courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member for Joo Chiat has suggested

the inclusion of an air-conditioned badminton hall

in  the  National  Stadium  complex,  it  will  be

necessary  to  make  a close examination  of  this

suggestion  in the light of the following  factors

before  a  decision  is  taken  to  include   this

facility  in  that  complex. First,  whether  air-conditioning will interfere with the game; second,

whether air-conditioning will put our players at a

disadvantage  when  they  have  to  compete  under

natural  conditions in places  such  as  Djakarta,

Kuala  Lumpur, Manila and Bangkok, where the halls

are  not  air-conditioned; third, whether  we  are

exploiting  our  natural  advantages   of   better

reaction to heat in comparison with those  players

in termperate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



climate  when playing in the  tropics.  It

will  be  necessary for all these  factors  to  be

studied before a decision is taken to build an air-conditioned badminton hall in the complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of the Member for

Punggol  on  how the stadium can help to  build  a

rugged  society,  I have already mentioned  before

the part that sports can play in building a robust

nation. The national stadium, when completed, will

be  used  extensively by sports  organisations  in

Singapore  as  well as by students  from  schools,

colleges, universities, etc. Although such use  of

these facilities will not bring in much money,  it

is  also  planned to use the national stadium  for

other  purposes so that proceeds from  such  usage

will  help to pay for the running of the  stadium.

Examinations  of  such  use  are  being  made   at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Sports Complex at Kallang, the

Ministry   has   planned  also  to   improve   the

facilities  at  Jalan Besar Stadium,  Farrer  Park

Athletic  Centre and Balestier Plain to  serve  as

subsidiary centres for sports. However,  as  there

is  a great concentration of population in Housing

and  Development Board estates, the Board will  be

urged  to  provide  more playing fields,  swimming

pools   and  gymnasiums,  etc.,  in  the   housing

estates. The provision of such facilities will not

only   maintain  the  physical  fitness   of   our

population  but will also help the youths  in  the

estates  to get to know one another better through

community sports and games.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage sports in the manner planned, funds

will  have to be raised. Members are already aware

that  the  proceeds  from the  Toto  Pools  to  be

started soon will be utilised to meet the cost  of

building the Kallang Sports Complex. To supplement

the proceeds of the Toto Pools in meeting the cost

of  setting up new training facilities, employment

of  expert coaches, sending Singapore's  teams  to

compete in overseas competitions and holding local

competitions  with invited overseas participation,

my  Ministry plans to set up a Central  Fund  for,

sports promotion. This will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



enable   greater  public  participation   in   the

financing  of sports promotion. As an  inducement,

it  is  planned that such public contributions  to

this Fund will be exempted from income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am also taking this

opportunity to explain to the House how the Social

Welfare  Department  exercises  economy   in   the

provision  of its welfare services. In  line  with

the  declared policy of the Government to get full

value for every dollar spent, services provided by

the  Social Welfare Department will be kept  under

constant   review  to  determine   whether   these

services  must  necessarily  be  provided  by  the

Government and, if so, how maximum economy can  be

achieved in the provision of welfare services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the Department has made a start in

evaluating its welfare programmes. The purpose  of

such   evaluation  is  to  eliminate   duplication

between  services provided by the  Government  and

those   operating  under  private  and   voluntary

auspices. All necessary steps will be taken to co-ordinate  the  network  of  welfare  services  and

maximise   the  use  of  personnel  and   material

resources. Where it is found necessary to  improve

the  quality and coverage of these services,  this

will   be  done  at  the  lowest  possible   cost.

Increasing emphasis will also be placed  on  those

welfare  services  that can contribute  towards  a

fuller  development of human resources as  opposed

to   those   other   services  that   are   merely

palliatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of the Department's work which can be

contracted  without consequent social ill  effects

is the service provided in the children's centres.

These centres were originally established to  help

tackle  the  post-war  problems  of  malnutrition,

illiteracy  and delinquency. These problems  have,

over  the  years,  been  greatly  ameliorated  and

consequently  the  role of the children's  centres

today  is not as important as it used to be.  With

the  increasing  number of schools  and  community

centres,  most of them with kindergarten  classes,

it is apparent that the need for the Department to

continue operating children's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



centres   will   gradually  decrease.   In   fact,

attendances in a few of the centres have begun  to

show  a  steady decline. It is, therefore, logical

to consider closing down the 16 children's centres

in stages commencing with those in the rural areas

as and when their enrolment drops. For a start, it

is  proposed  to close down the Yio Chu  Kang  and

Boon  Teck Road centres, as the former is situated

in   a   rural   area  served  by  four   People's

Association  kindergartens  and  the   latter   is

affected by the clearance programme for Toa  Payoh

New Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to utilise fully the facilities in the

10  creches,  a number of vacant places  in  these

creches  will  be offered to children  of  working

parents  in  the higher income groups. But  unlike

those  from families with incomes below  $500  per

month  who  will  continue to  enjoy  the  heavily

subsidized  creche facilities, children  from  the

higher  income  families  will  have  to  pay   an

economic admission charge. Further details of this

new scheme will be announced shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department has also sought ways and means to

make its 12 Social Welfare Homes as productive and

self-sufficient   as   possible.   For    example,

residents  of  these  Homes are  now  required  to

perform  some  of the domestic chores  which  were

previously  done  by paid staff.  The  able-bodied

beggars and destitutes will be organised into work

parties  to  undertake work projects both  in  and

outside  the Homes. Residents will also be trained

to  do  productive and meaningful work. One Social

Welfare  Home is now producing noodles for  supply

to   the   other  Homes.  The  Homes  are  thereby

supporting the Eat-More-Wheat Campaign and, at the

same time, effecting savings in their rations bill

by  making  their  own noodles.  Another  Home  is

offering  a cake-making and food-catering  service

for  small  parties and laundry work  for  private

firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents in the Homes will be taught to

produce  attractive handicraft articles for  sale.

Revenue  from such sales of work will be used  for

the benefit of the Homes, thereby reducing their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



running  cost.  Instructors in the  various  Homes

have  been sent on refresher courses in handicraft

to  enable them to introduce the latest methods in

producing attractive saleable handicraft articles.

More  cottage  industries such as orchid  growing,

tropical   fish   rearing,  racket   re-stringing,

manufacture of racket presses and tourist souvenir

articles will be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will not only help to prepare the

younger  residents  for early discharge  to  start

projects  on their own or take up paid  employment

outside,  but  will  also  result  in  substantial

reduction  of  departmental  expenditure  both  in

terms of a quicker turnover of residents and fewer

staff  like  welfare attendants,  gardeners,  etc.

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing welfare services will be oriented

towards  the  strengthening of the family  as  the

basic  unit  of our society and the prevention  of

breakdown  in  family  life. The  preservation  of

strong  family ties and the encouragement of  each

family  to look after its own members is the  best

way  of  keeping  the  country's  expenditure   on

welfare services within reasonable limits. Parents

must   be   made   to  shoulder   their   parental

responsibilities  towards their children  who,  in

turn, must be taught to take care of their parents

in  their declining years. In this way, there will

be  less  need  for social welfare  services  like

public    assistance    and    institutions    for

delinquents,  destitutes  and  old   people.   The

welfare  resources can then be applied to services

which  can  contribute more positively  towards  a

better life for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will, of course, be interstitial areas

requiring  the  provision of the more  traditional

types of welfare services. In this task, the whole

community  must  share the responsibility.  It  is

most  gratifying  to see the extremely  good  work

that is being done by many voluntary organisations

in  caring for the aged, the handicapped  and  the

needy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead, my Ministry will actively

encourage and help in whatever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



way   possible   the   work   of   the   voluntary

organisations    providing   services    to    the

handicapped,  disabled and aged and  in  areas  of

activity not being provided now by the Government.

Periodic  visits to the various voluntary  welfare

organisations  made  by me have  revealed  a  high

standard of service in the voluntary field. It  is

very evident that some of the staff are absolutely

dedicated to their work. To these people, there is

no   such   thing  as  office  hours.  They   work

incredibly long hours and at all times of the  day

and  night  without  complaint.  They  are  always

thinking of ways and means to help improve the lot

of  the less fortunate ones for whose welfare they

are  working.  Such selfless devoted service  they

give  cannot be bought with money. In fact,  I  am

told  that  some  of  these workers  return  their

salaries  or allowances to their organisations  to

be used for furthering their good work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more public-spirited citizens of Singapore

coming forward and following the example of  these

dedicated voluntary helpers, the problem of caring

for the disabled, the handicapped and the aged  in

our  society will be greatly reduced. There is  no

greater satisfaction than in helping in one way or

another the less fortunate of our fellow citizens.

As more voluntary helpers offer their services not

only  in voluntary organisations but also  in  the

Social  Welfare  Homes, the  objective  of  making

these  Homes self-sufficient will be more  quickly

achieved. This is particularly so if the voluntary

helpers  have special skills that can be  imparted

to the residents and staff of the Homes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  join  the Prime Minister in  thanking  the

President  for his gracious speech which  outlines

our  Government's policies for the crucial  period

ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the motion, the Prime Minister has

correctly  pointed out the principal factors  that

made Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



what it is today, namely, our human resources, our

strategic      geographical     location,      our

infrastructure   and   experience   in   commerce,

industry and communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I be permitted to refer to an article in

The  Mirror  dated  18th March,  1968,  quoting  a

survey carried out by Business International ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, I think you will have to

get closer to the microphone because your voice is

not    coming   through   the   ear-pieces.    The

Interpreters  and  the  Reporters  may  be  having

difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Yes, Sir, as I was saying,

The Mirror quotes a survey carried out by Business

International  on the relative attractiveness  and

investment  environment of eight major  cities  in

this   region.   Of  the  22  factors   considered

important,   only  three  are   related   to   the

geographical  situation: the rest are  related  to

human  factors. Indeed, it must be  so,  otherwise

our  surrounding islands would become very serious

competitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have any rich natural resources other

than our two million people and the knowledge  and

infrastructure they possess. Our Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



considers   it   to   be   our   paramount

responsibility   to   accelerate   the   pace   of

development  and formation of our  human  capital,

and  we  will  spare no effort in  achieving  this

goal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members may recall that almost  nine  years

ago when our Party first took office, we laid down

our  three  main principles on education.  One  of

them is to put emphasis on practical subjects like

Mathematics and Science, so that our citizens  are

taught  to  use their hands and their  brains.  We

must  break the "white-collar" consciousness which

must belong only to the past. The ground work  has

been   laid  successfully  and  it  is   time   to

reorganise our education system to keep pace  with

our  industrialisation success. In short, we  have

achieved  in  our economic development  more  than

what we promised and at a much faster rate than we

planned.
