<div align="center"><b>AUCTIONEERS' LICENCES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Auctioneers' Licences Act to

give  legislative effect to remove the need for licensing  of

auctioneers.

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auctioneers' Licences Act, which was enacted in

1906, licenses auctioneers, appraisers and house agents.  The

Act  serves to regulate persons who conduct the sale of goods

or any other properties through open bidding.  We have looked

at  the  relevance of licensing auctioneers today,  and  have

concluded that there is no need to license auctioneers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auctioning is a mode of sale. A good sold by auction

could  be  similarly  sold by direct sale,  telemarketing  or

exhibition  sale.  Other modes of sale such as direct  sales,

telemarketing  or  exhibition sales  are  not  licensed.   An

auction  sale  is  open and subscribes to willing  buyer  and

willing  seller  principles.  Buyers and sellers  enter  into

mutually agreeable contractual terms in the sale.  Therefore,

they  are  in  the  position to determine what  are  mutually

agreeable  terms of sale without the need for another  safety

net via licensing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from auctioneers who are currently licensed

indicate  that  the various trades see little  value  in  the

licensing  requirement.   The removal  of  licensing  is  not

expected  to  have  adverse impact on their  activities.   In

addition, removing the need to apply for a licence would make

it  easier for auctioneers to carry out their work, and could

encourage more professional auctioning activities to be based

in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Proposed Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the

Auctioneers' Licences Act:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to change the title of the Act to Appraisers and

House Agents Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to remove the definition of auctioneers and the

requirements   imposed  on  them  in  conducting   auctioning

activities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to remove any reference to auctioneers in the

various sections of the Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to have the transitional provision to deem all

auctioneers  to  have the appraiser and house agent  licences

until 31st December 2000; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to amend the schedule to the Act.

<br><br><i>Transition Measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a transition measure, auctioneers, who hold licences

for the auction of land and building and immovable properties

and  are  engaged in the appraisal or sale or rental of  such

properties,  will  be deemed to hold an  appraiser  or  house

agent  licence as the case may be until the expiry  of  their

licences  on 31st December 2000.  Thereafter, those who  wish

to continue to perform appraisal or house agent services will

have  to  apply for the appropriate licence of  appraiser  or

house agent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Council of Social Service or NCSS

leads,   funds,   supports  and  guides   voluntary   welfare

organisations or VWOs and provides the crucial  link  between

them  and  the Government.  The Bill seeks to amend the  NCSS

Act  to  enable the Council to remain relevant and responsive

to  the fast-developing social service sector.  A decade ago,

NCSS  had around 180 VWOs registered as member organisations.

By March this year, it had 259 members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments will strengthen the Council's ability to

lead  and guide the voluntary sector effectively and  develop

professionalism  in  social  service  provision.   This  will

benefit  all  Singaporeans who use the services  provided  by

NCSS and its various member organisations.

<br><br><i>Strengthening the NCSS Leadership</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the provisions aimed at

strengthening the NCSS leadership.  The first relates to  the

provision for an additional Vice-President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCSS Act currently provides for one elected Vice-President who assists the President, and assumes the latter's

responsibilities   in   his   absence.     The    President's

responsibilities  have been increasing  steadily,  in  tandem

with  the  rapid development of, and demands in,  the  social

service  sector.   In  view of this, clause  3  of  the  Bill

introduces  a  provision for a second  Vice-President  to  be

appointed by the Minister, in consultation with the President

of  NCSS.   Besides strengthening Board leadership,  it  will

offer  the  President an additional avenue to groom potential

successors,  thereby  enhancing succession  planning  in  the

Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second main change is the removal of the provision

for  three co-opted members on the NCSS Board.  These members

were originally included to bring in additional expertise  to

the  Board in specific areas (such as human resource,  public

relations and training).  They cannot vote and are not  fully

involved in, and accountable for, the proper governance of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>

NCSS.   The Council would like to see all Board members being

accountable  and  active participants.  The  proposed  change

will strengthen board governance.  With this change, the NCSS

Board will have a maximum of 23 members, from the current 25.

It will be trimmer but it will be stronger.

<br><br><i>Representation on the NCSS Board and the Council</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few provisions deal with the proper conduct of

representation on the NCSS Board and the Council.  Currently,

there  is  no  prohibition against persons representing  more

than one member organisation.  This entitles some members  to

multiple  votes at the Annual General Meeting, if  they  hold

positions  in  several organisations and  are  authorised  by

these organisations to represent them.  There is a risk  that

one   person   or   a   group  of  persons   could   have   a

disproportionate influence on the governance of NCSS.   While

we  have thus far been fortunate not to have encountered this

problem,  it  is  wise  to prevent it from  happening.   With

increased active citizenship, we can expect more people to be

involved  in  the  voluntary sector, and  in  more  than  one

organisation at any one time.  Hence, clause 11 introduces  a

provision  to  prohibit persons from acting  as  an  official

representative of more than one member organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees of NCSS or member organisations are also

currently   not  barred  from  serving  on   the   Board   or

participating  in Board elections.  To prevent any  potential

conflict   of  interest,  clause  3  of  the  Bill  therefore

introduces  a new provision to bar employees of the  NCSS  or

member  organisations  from serving on  the  Board  and  from

participating in the election of Board members.

<br><br><i>Powers to Establish Institutions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS currently does not have the power to set up

autonomous entities or institutions.  This limits  its  scope

of  action.   Clause  7  of the Bill therefore  introduces  a

provision  to  empower the NCSS to form bodies  corporate  or

incorporate or joint

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>

ventures to carry out its objectives.  I must emphasise  here

that  this  provision does not mean that NCSS  will  go  into

business.  NCSS will indeed remain a non profit-making entity

focused  on its primary mission, which is to promote, develop

and provide effective social services in Singapore.  However,

this  change  would  enable it to  set  up  more  focused  or

specialised  institutions to achieve  its  stated  objectives

more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such institution is the National Volunteer Centre

(NVC),  the recently established national body for  promoting

volunteerism.  The NVC currently exists as a committee.  With

the  proposed  amendment to the Act, the NVC  can  become  an

autonomous  entity  under the NCSS  Act.   As  an  autonomous

agency, the NVC will be able to focus more effectively on its

mandate  of  promoting volunteerism in  Singapore.   It  will

enable NVC to establish its own administrative capability and

so  operate  with greater speed and flexibility.  The  change

will  make for more effective decision-making and governance,

as  NVC will be able to focus on all sectors instead of  just

the social sector, as is NCSS' mission.  It will also be able

to  develop  a  distinct  identity and  garner  support  more

effectively as an organisation dedicated to the promotion  of

volunteerism.

<br><br><i>Maintaining Standards of Professionalism Among Member Organisations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS plays an important role in ensuring that the

voluntary  welfare organisations affiliated to  it  are  well

managed  and  provide an acceptable standard of  professional

practice.  As the voluntary sector grows, NCSS will  need  to

play  an  even more critical role in ensuring that  standards

are  met.   Of  particular concern will be the  standards  of

service  provision,  fund raising, and financial  management.

VWOs  provide services to some of the more vulnerable members

of  the  community.   Clients therefore must  trust  VWOs  to

provide  sound  and professional advice.  The VWOs  are  also

responsible for making good use of funds generously  provided

by  the community.  Although the vast majority of VWOs  fully

deserve the respect and trust of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>

community  for  their  high standards of professionalism  and

service, there may be a need for NCSS to nudge a VWO  or  two

to improve its management or services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS provides grants and other assistance to its member

organisations.   It guides the sector by issuing  guidelines,

guide  books, manuals on operating concepts and  so  on.   It

also  guides  and directs agencies through its  selection  of

programmes  to  fund, through initiating new programmes  with

selected  VWOs, and through consultancy advice.  However,  if

an agency refuses to comply with guidelines on services or on

other  management issues like finance and fund  raising,  and

this  leads  to a deterioration in services or mismanagement,

NCSS can only remove funding.  It has no power to investigate

complaints  or  inquire  into the management  of  its  member

organisations  should the situation call for it.   Clauses  7

and  13  of  the Bill therefore amend the Act to empower  the

NCSS to investigate complaints, exercise control over and  if

necessary, discipline errant member organisations.  NCSS will

thus  be  in  a  stronger  position  to  ensure  that  member

organisations maintain acceptable standards of accountability

and service provision.  In this way, NCSS will be better able

to safeguard the interest of clients who require the services

provided  by  VWOs and the community which provides  generous

support to these VWOs.

<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these proposed amendments will

strengthen  the Board's position as the umbrella organisation

of  the  social service sector.  Collectively,  the  measures

enable NCSS to remain relevant and progressive in the face of

a dynamic and growing social service sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the proposed amendments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is really important that we have good leadership

in  the voluntary organisations.  The very fact that they are

voluntary in nature, we tend to think that the people who are

managing   them  become  less  accountable.   This   is   not

necessarily so.  If all voluntary organisations are to become

effective  and responsive to the needs of not  only  the  low

income  families, but also other families that require  help,

then we should have an effective management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the amendments would

strengthen  the  capacity of the Council to  respond  to  new

needs  and new challenges.  It is important at this  juncture

that  voluntary organisations, not only the National  Council

of Social Service, but also other relevant community sectors,

look  at  how  they can meet the needs of those  who  require

assistance.  And with the new issues and problems related  to

families,  children and young persons, it is  very  important

that  the  organisation undertakes a review to  see  how  its

leadership has the capacity to mobilize the participation  of

volunteers  in the organisation and make it more  responsive.

What  I  would like to find out from the Minister is  whether

the  restructuring  that is undertaken at  the  Council  will

provide  that  flexibility for it to  garner  more  community

support  and  also to instruct and guide these  organisations

that are affiliated to the Council to meet new challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other crucial factor that needs to be addressed

is  the  leadership in the organisation itself,  particularly

the leadership in the National Council of Social Service.  As

we  know, in most voluntary organisations, the leadership  is

graying.   Therefore,  it is very important  to  ensure  that

there  is  renewal  of  its leadership  in  the  organisation

itself,  particularly the National Council of Social Service.

So  I  want  to find out whether these changes do  allow  the

Council  itself  to undertake leadership renewal  within  its

rank and thus encourage younger people to be involved in  the

organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is the ownership of the National Council

of  Social Service by the voluntary sector itself.  The  Bill

covers an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>

element   of   nomination  by  the  Ministry   of   Community

Development as well as by election process.  So I would  like

to  find out whether these changes will, in any way, have  an

impact   on   the   issue  of  ownership  by  the   voluntary

organisations of the Council itself.  What I am trying to say

is that it is very important that we ensure the participation

of  volunteers  and  that  the  voluntary  organisations  are

entrenched and further strengthened so that we will  be  able

to encourage more people to take an active interest in trying

to  promote  problem solving within the community.   I  would

like  to  ask  the  Minister whether  the  ownership  by  the

voluntary sector is further enhanced by such changes that are

being proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that note, I would like to support the

amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the National Council of Social Service  (NCSS)

has  now  a  total  of   259 voluntary welfare  organisations

(VWOs) under its charge.  The main purpose of NCSS is to help

the  needy,  the  handicapped  and  the  elderly  people   by

providing the necessary services to them.  It leads, supports

and guides the various VWOs, and helps them to raise funds to

pay  for their operating expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCSS has also played a very important role as a

bridge  between  the  Government and the  VWOs  so  that  the

various  departments in the Government would  understand  the

needs  of the people and to make prompt responses to  satisfy

the needs of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment provides for an additional Vice-President

to   assist   the   President   and   assume   the   latter's

responsibilities  in his absence.  This will  provide  better

leadership  in  the  Council  and  to  ensure  that  all  the

affiliated  organisations will operate in a better  and  more

efficient manner.  All the members of the Council must   make

good  use  of  the resources contributed by  members  of  the

public  and  to help those who really need assistance,  in  a

fair and open manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the members of the National Council

of Social Service are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>

serving on a voluntary basis.  They do not get any salary and

they  sacrifice their precious time to help all the people in

the  society  who need their assistance and  services.   This

spirit of love and concern for the people is certainly worthy

of  our  praises and admiration.  With our population  ageing

more  and more rapidly, in  time to come, there will be  more

and more people who would need such services and the National

Council  of Social Service will certainly be assuming heavier

responsibilities  in  the future.  There  should  be  a  more

effective  channel  to provide such assistance to these needy

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, one of the local television programmes

reflected  that  some  ordinary citizens  had  problems  that

required  assistance but they did not know where to turn  to.

Moreover,  with   the language barrier, they  found  it  very

difficult to seek help.  On many occasions, they went to some

voluntary  welfare organisations for help,  but  were  turned

away  as they could not make themselves understood.  Even  on

occasions  when  they could communicate  with  the  voluntary

welfare  officers,  their cases were not dealt  with  because

they apparently went to the wrong organisation, and they were

not   referred  to  the  appropriate  body.  It  was  a  very

frustrating experience for these poor folks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, we had a Social Welfare Department

popularly  known  as Hock Lee Bor in Hokkien.   All  the  old

folks knew about it.  Whenever they need any help, they could

always   go to the Social Welfare Department.  But  now  this

Department  is  no  more  in existence.   We  have  now  this

Ministry  graciously  known  as  the  Ministry  of  Community

Development and Sports.  To the ordinary citizens, this is  a

mystery to them.  They do not know what this Ministry is  all

about.    I  think  we  should give more  publicity  to  this

Ministry  to let the people realise that whenever  they  have

any problem they can turn to this Ministry for help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we do not have a one-stop service centre for all

welfare  work.   Sometimes, if the members of the  public  go

direct to the individual welfare organisations, they may  not

get the relevant one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>

and  be  given the kind of help required.   More  often  than

not,  they would be turned away without any referral  to  the

appropriate organisation  to follow up with the case.  I feel

that  the  Ministry  should  have  a  comprehensive  one-stop

service centre to provide better service to the needy people.

With  all  the  modern technology, computer and Internet,  we

could  easily  create a network that links  up  all  the  259

members  of  the  NCSS.  And with such a  better  network,  I

believe the National Council of Social Service would be  able

to  provide  better service to members of the public.   If  a

person  is to go to any individual organisation for help  and

if  the said organisation could not be of help to the person,

the case should be referred to the headquarters in order that

it  could  be  directed to the appropriate organisations  for

help.  By so doing, we would be able to assist our people  in

a more systematic manner, just like what we have described as

"sending hot charcoal in a snowy weather".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have never experienced cold winter

weather  and snow means nothing to us.  Maybe, we should  say

"sending  an  umbrella during a rainy day".  During  a  rainy

day,  when one needs an umbrella, let us provide him with  an

umbrella and he will certainly  appreciate it.  I believe  in

sending  an  umbrella during a rainy day.  Our  young  people

will  understand that, because there is one song known as  In

The  Rain,  which  they sing frequently in karaoke  sessions.

They  will understand what it means to be offered an umbrella

during a heavy rain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when Singapore is moving towards a

highly  urbanised and high-technology environment,  we should

also  not  forget  to  place more  emphasis  on   inter-human

relationship.  The Government has been leading  us  well  and

our civil service is very effective, and we are ranked number

one   in   various  aspects  of   our  economic  development.

However,  according to a survey by the HDB,  our  people  are

found to be lacking in care and concern for their neighbours,

and social  cohesion among our people is not as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>

strong as before.  We have not progressed in this aspect.  We

should  endeavour to enhance our social cohesion  to  develop

the  type  of  kampung spirit so that we would be successful,

both economically and socially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister would consider my suggestion,

that  is,  to set up a comprehensive one-stop service  centre

for  the  benefit of our people who are in need  of   welfare

assistance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is progressive and will augur well in enabling

the  NCSS  to  remain  relevant in the new  millennium.   The

changes  are intended to enable NCSS to lead and  guide  VWOs

with  speed and effectiveness.  That is important because  MP

Ang  Mong  Seng  has also stressed that.  Thus,  it  is  most

disappointing  to me to see that one major  element  has  not

been  addressed,  and that is, the size of  the  Board.   The

current  NCSS  Act provides for a Board of  22  members  plus

three  additional  co-opted  members,  making  it  25.    The

proposed  amendment  is good.  It is adding  one  more  Vice-President  and  it has done away with three co-opted  members

and that reduces the size to 23 members which, in my view, is

still far too large.

I  am of the view that, with the amendments to be made to the

Act,  it is opportune to consider streamlining the Board  for

greater  flexibility  and nimbleness in  the  decision-making

process.    Whilst  one  may  argue  that   there   must   be

representation  from  Council members, really  eight  members

from  the full members and two associate members out  of  255

members  of the Council really means very little.  The  Board

is there to consider and make the decisions.  It is important

to have representations and, in my view, it is more important

to  ensure that there is a mechanism whereby the Board  needs

members  on a regular basis, at least quarterly, if not  more

often,  to  collect  feedback.  And  today,  with  electronic

means, there should be constant feedback from members of  the

Council to the Board.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in my view, 8 from the full members and 2 from the

associate members have not much meaning except I would  still

like  to  see  at least 2 from each, so that when  the  Board

considers matters, you can be assured that the views  of  the

service providers are being considered.  I notice that out of

the  23  members,  it  already  included  the  five  Head  of

Divisions.   To  argue that there must be greater  or  fuller

representation from all the various sectors would just result

in  a  very  enlarged Board which is going to slow  down  the

process.  That  argument does not stand.  For  example,  just

take  the  Disability Division.  There are so many  forms  of

disabilities  and  where  does it end  in  terms  of  getting

everyone represented?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister, while there is still time,

even at the Committee stage, to amend the figures and I would

be  quite  happy  to see that the numbers provided  for  full

members  and  associate  members  be  reduced  to  3  and   1

respectively.  So  instead of having the ten representations,

we  have four, and instead of having 23 on the Board, we will

reduce   that  to  17,  which  will  certainly  improve   the

situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the

Members for their views and support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address the views and comments of Dr

Vasoo.  He asked whether we could provide further flexibility

in  the  Council  with  the  changes  and  also  whether  the

representation is adequate.  Certainly, there is flexibility,

as  has  been  alluded to also by Mr Ee, and the Board  could

always  seek the views of resource persons outside the Board.

And  certainly in this IT age, the avenues open to the  Board

to  seek views and comments from beyond the organisation  are

certainly there.  In terms of representation, I think  it  is

adequate.  Mr Ee says that it is more than adequate and he is

suggesting that perhaps the Board could be further downsized.

Obviously, there are two conflicting views here.  In terms of

ownership and changes, there is definitely ownership, in  the

sense  that you have representation by the various  VWOs  and

this has been there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>

all  the  time  and  it  will certainly increase,  given  the

growing civil society in Singapore and people wanting  to  do

voluntary  work  and would also definitely  want  to  involve

themselves  with  the Board.  I agree with  the  Member  that

participation  and  organisation  are  important  and  proper

representation is also important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has got several views, both on the

state of the NCSS and also on the community although many  of

them  do  not really impinge directly on the changes  to  the

Act.    But,  nevertheless,  they  are  sound  views  and   I

appreciate the Member articulating these views. There is  one

item  though which the Member specifically wanted us  to  do,

which  is  whether we could have a one-stop centre to  enable

people who want help to come to the centre and be referred to

the  proper  organisation  so  that  their  needs  could   be

addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any member of the community could always come to

NCSS to seek their help. But, more importantly, members could

go to the CDCs too. It is more convenient, it is within their

location, and now that we are devolving more and more of  our

functions to the CDCs, they have full knowledge of  who  does

what and, therefore, could easily refer anyone in need to the

proper organisation, and they have Mandarin-speaking officers

too.   Quite apart from that, they can also go to the  Family

Service  Centres  (FSCs).  The Family Service  Centres  would

also  have with them the organizations that are available  to

offer the kind of help that is needed by the persons who want

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked for a further downsizing of the

Board.   In  stating  this,  I can  appreciate  the  need  to

downsize the Board, the need for the Board to be trimmed,  to

be flexible and to move fast.  But at the same time, you have

also  views like that articulated by Dr Vasoo, ie, the  Board

should have proper representation from the VWOs.  In my view,

the  amendment  now proposed is not so much to  downsize  the

Board but to rationalise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>

the workings of NCSS.  But certainly, he will be watching how

the  changed Board will proceed and how it will work  and  if

there is need to further downsize the Board, I think that  is

something which we can consider in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Abdullah Tarmugi].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.
