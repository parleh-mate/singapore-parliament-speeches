<div align="center"><b>(Removal of blood stains)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Defence  whether the Police will liaise  with  the

Public  Cleansing Branch of the Ministry of Health

for  the removal of any blood stains on the  roads

immediately  after injured persons or dead  bodies

are removed from the scene of an accident.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arrangements have been made for the

Public  Cleansing Corps of the Ministry of  Health

to  remove blood stains on the road between 6  a.m.

and 6 p.m. after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



the injured persons or dead bodies have been taken

away from the scene of accidents. In the event  of

blood stains left on the road between 6 p.m. and 6

a.m.,  the Police will cover up these stains  with

sawdust  which will be swept as soon as  possible.

The Public Cleansing Corps will be contacted at  6

a.m. the  following morning for a  more  thorough

cleansing of the stains.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TRAFFIC LAWS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Stricter enforcement to curb accidents)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for

Defence whether he will adopt stricter enforcement

of  traffic laws in view of the alarming  increase

of fatal accidents recently.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to

say  that statistics show that there was a decrease

in  the  number of fatal accident cases in 1969  as

compared with the previous year. In 1969, a  total

of  302 persons were killed on the road, whereas in

1968,  the  number of road accident victims  killed

was 312. The traffic police are already stepping up

action  against motorists who show no consideration

for  other road users on the roads, and the traffic

laws are being enforced as strictly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of composition fines that can be

imposed for traffic offences which are compoundable

has   been   reviewed,   and   the   Ministry    of

Communications   has   been  urged   to   introduce

legislation   in   order  to  raise   the   maximum

composition  fine  from $20 to  $50  so  that  the

habitual  offender will not get off as  lightly  as

the  first offender. The majority of road accidents

in  1969 involved pedestrians who crossed the  road

heedless   of   road  traffic.  The   question   of

prohibiting  jaywalking is now being considered  by

the Ministry of Communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Development Estimates of

Expenditure for the financial year 1st April, 1970,

to  31st March, 1971, contained in Paper Cmd. 5  of

1970.  Before  I go further, I must remind  Members

that the debate on these Development Estimates will

proceed  purely  on  the basis of  development  and

principles  concerning  development.  Members  will

therefore  confine their remarks to the development

aspects of the items they propose to discuss, and I

intend to be strict on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that the amount of time requested by

Members   for  the  discussion  of  their   various

amendments  exceeded the time available  by  almost

four  times,  and it was necessary,  therefore,  to

curtail  Members'  requirements  by  about   three-quarters.  I  hope Members will have this  in  mind

when they speak on their amendments and will be  as

brief  as possible in their speeches in order  that

all, or, failing that, as many as possible, of  the

amendments  standing on the Order Paper  Supplement

can be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the convenience of Members, I intend taking

the  total  for  each  head of  expenditure  as  it

appears in the last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



column  of  Summary of Estimated  Expenditure  on

pages 5 and 6 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure

in respect of which amendments stand on the Order

Paper Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 10 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 10 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item 001 of subhead

101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is acknowledged that over

the   past   ten   years,  Singapore   has   made

considerable   progress  politically,   socially,

industrially and economically. New laws have been

introduced and passed and existing laws have been

revised  and brought up to date. But I  must  say

that  reasonable  and suitable accommodation  for

the  administration of justice does not keep pace

with  other fields of progress that we have made.

I refer to the Criminal District and Magistrates'

Courts at South Bridge Road. It is stated in the

Memorandum on the Development Estimates (Misc.  2

of  1970)  that  the building  is  very  old  and

dilapidated.   In   fact,  the   conditions   are

considered unsafe and also overcrowded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the total expenditure for the

construction  of a new building is  estimated  to

cost  $6.4 million, only a sum of $750,000 is  to

be  voted for this year and that is also  subject

to   Treasury's   sanction.  According   to   the

Estimates  (Cmd. 4 of 1970), the revenue  derived

from  these courts during the past year  amounted

to  about $3 million for fines in the subordinate

courts,  and  about  $2 million  in  the  traffic

courts,  making  a  total  revenue  of  about  $5

million.  I  am sure, Sir, that the Minister  for

Law  will  agree  that even the offenders  should

expect  reasonable accommodation when they appear

in   these   courts.  Furthermore,  the   judges,

magistrates  and  the staff  who  work  in  these

courts should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



provided  with  more reasonable  and  suitable

accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the need

for  a  new  building  to house  our  subordinate

courts,   i.e.,   the   Criminal   District   and

Magistrates' Courts, the Traffic Courts  and  the

Civil District Courts, have been felt since 1963.

However,  for one reason or another, it  was  not

possible  to  implement the proposal  until  now,

when   opportunity  has  been  taken,  with   the

proposed redevelopment of the areas adjoining and

surrounding  the existing Criminal  District  and

Magistrates'  Courts in South Bridge  Road  under

the  urban  renewal  scheme, to  provide  a  site

approximately 92,000 square feet in area for this

new  building  opposite the present  Ministry  of

Labour  within  the area bounded  by  Park  Road,

Pearl's  Hill Road, Havelock Road and New  Market

Road.  The  new building will be a 14-storey  one

designed  to cope with the needs of the  next  50

years. It will have a floor area of about 200,000

square  feet,  of which a little more  than  half

will  be air-conditioned. Besides 25 court rooms,

there  will  be chambers, ante-chambers,  witness

rooms and a big general office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building, which is estimated to cost $6½ million - and this excludes furniture and

equipment  is expected to be completed  within  a

period of three years. It is hoped to be able  to

commence construction work in July this year. The

provision of $750,000 now provided under Head 10,

subhead  101, item 001, is required to  meet  the

cost  of initial work for the foundation,  piling

and  likewise. In fact, the sum has received  the

approval of Treasury.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, in view of the

explanation. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $750,010 for Head 10 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that a sum of $300,000 has been

provided  in the two items under the above  subhead

for  improvements to the National Museum (Works and

Buildings  -  $200,000) (Furniture and Equipment  - $100,000),  and I wish to take this opportunity  to

praise  and  thank the Minister concerned  for  his

keen  interest shown in this respect. My suggestion

made  last  year  that  the names  of  the  various

categories  of exhibits in the National  Museum  be

written  in  four languages has been  accepted  and

implemented. This is confirmed by my visit  to  the

museum recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I wish to ask the Minister the following

four questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) What improvements will be made to the National Museum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) What type of equipment will be purchased for the museum, and what is the estimated cost?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) What was the sum incurred in the purchase of curios last year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) During the past year, how many persons visited the museum and what was the

percentage of visitors who were students?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may know whether the National

Museum  arranged  for  students  to  visit  museum,

because   I  think  this  increase  their  cultural

knowledge?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, following the Government's

decision  in  1968  to convert the  museum  into  a

natural  history  museum, it was decided  that  the

reorganisation  be  held in  abeyance  pending  the

recommendations  and  costing  by  a   U.N.E.S.C.O.

expert  for whose services the Ministry of  Science

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



Technology  had  requested. The expert,  Mr  James

Gardner,  a designer, arrived in late January  1970

for  a short stay of ten days. He advised that  the

present  taxonomic arrangement was out of date  and

that,  instead,  the approach should  be  one  that

would lend itself to lively presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recommended that a far greater sum of money

than  the amount provided for is required  for  the

reorganisation. He recommended to the Museum  Board

and the Minister for Science and Technology that  a

pilot  project  be implemented. The pilot  project,

which  will set the trend for future reorganisation

of  the  museum,  will  depict  the  ecology  of  a

tropical  rain  forest. It will cover  about  5,000

square  feet  and will cost about $300,000.  Action

has been taken with Mr Gardner, now in London, for

the  preparation  of  a  new  brief  with  detailed

costing  for submission to the Ministry of Finance.

As  for  equipment,  we are now  awaiting  detailed

costing  of the items from Mr Gardner.  The  items

will  include modern show-cases with internal light

fittings  for  all the exhibits pertaining  to  the

rain  forest.  The exhibits will comprise  insects,

large  and  small  mammals and birds,  as  well  as

fabricated interiors of the various habitats  these

animals occupy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 304,000 persons, the majority of whom

are students, visited the museum as against 342,000

in 1968. However, for the first two months in 1970,

a  record  number  of 221,000 persons  visited  it.

Arrangements are being made for school children  to

visit  it on conducted tours. I think at the moment

there  are  two teachers attached to  the  National

Museum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Minister for his answer. I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 201*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our young people today are more inclined to

the study of science than art. This is borne out by

the  fact that there is an increasing enrolment for

the science stream at the pre-university level.  It

is from this pre-university level that the students

branch  out  to  specialise in chemistry,  physics,

engineering,  medicine, etc, when  they  enter  the

universities  or  other  institutions   of   higher

learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the process of industrialisation, there

is a great need for more and more science graduates

and  other professionals to man the essential posts

in  all fields. It is, therefore, important for our

young  people  in schools as well  as  the  general

public to have a good understanding of what science

can  do for mankind in general, and how it can help

our society in particular to achieve success in our

industrialisation programme. In this  respect,  the

Government has not lost sight of the need to  build

a  Popular Science Centre for this purpose. It  has

already  been  explained in the Memorandum  on  the

Development  Estimates (Misc. 2 of 1970)  that  the

building of this Popular Science Centre is to  give

the  people of Singapore a better understanding  of

the   role  of  science  and  technology   in   the

Republic's industrialisation programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Minister's reply to the Member for

Telok  Blangah earlier on, when the House discussed

the Ordinary Estimates, he told us what he proposed

to  do  and  what  he wished to achieve  with  this

Popular  Science Centre. Can he again elaborate  on

this subject for the benefit of the Members in this

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Popular  Science  Centre  project  has  been  quite

adequately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



explained by my colleague. I do not think there  is

any need for me to add to his explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Before I withdraw my

amendment,  I  would like to ask the Minister  when

this Popular Science Centre will be set up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the

moment we are looking for a suitable site for  this

centre.  When  it  is available, further  publicity

will  be  given  to this project.  The  Member  for

Mountbatten will then be duly informed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Is it in the Mountbatten

Constituency? On that note, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,800,030 for Head 11 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 21 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 001+.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+ The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Ho Kah Leong and Mr Lim Soo Peng.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that $50 million

has  been provided to expand Jurong Town.  I  think

this  expenditure is important and can benefit  our

country.  However, I wish to ask  three  questions.

First, for what purpose is this large sum of  money

intended? Secondly how many acres of land have been

used   for  building  factories  in  Jurong   Town?

Thirdly,  how many applications for factories  have

been deferred?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Member  for

Sembawang  for  being  very  concerned  about the

affairs in Jurong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I move this amendment is that I

would  like  to  seek information  on  two  points.

First,  can  the  Minister  tell  us  whether   the

provision   of  this  $50  million  also   includes

provision for the setting up of a community centre?

We  all  know  that  in  the  last  few  years  the

development in Jurong has been very rapid and there

are now more than 20,000 residents there.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there is a community centre housed in

flat  premises. It does not meet the needs  of  the

residents  there because it is quite far away  from

the  main residential area. I would like to ask the

Minister  whether a community centre located  in  a

central point in Jurong Town will be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is whether this $50 million

provision  includes  the building  of  a  secondary

school  in Jurong Town. I ask this question because

at  present there is only one primary school  there

and  it  is  overcrowded. Therefore, many secondary

school students living in Jurong Town have to go to

schools at distant places. Can the Minister tell us

whether  the  Jurong Town Corporation  intends  to

build a secondary school in Jurong Town?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Sir, in providing

facilities   and   amenities,   the   Jurong   Town

Corporation  appears  to  have  forgotten  a   very

important  need - there is no fire station  in  this

industrial area. A fire station is the back-bone of

our industrial system. The nearest fire station  is

miles  away, and at present even without a  traffic

jam a fire engine takes 15 to 20 minutes to reach a

factory in the Jurong industrial estate. If  it  is

not   the   responsibility  of  the   Jurong   Town

Corporation to provide a fire station, will it  not

at  least make available a piece of land for a fire

station, and get the proper authorities to  put  it

up?  After all, the Jurong Town Corporation has  to

protect its own interests as well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, this loan of $50 million will pay for a wide

range of development projects which the Jurong Town

Corporation  intends to carry out  in  this  fiscal

year.  It includes land development, both in Jurong

estate  as well as in other areas of Singapore. It

is  also proposed to extend the deep-water wharves,

and the total cost of this wharf extension will  be

$10 million. Standard factory buildings, as well as

flatted factory buildings, are expected to come  to

nearly $13 million. A total of $8.8 million will go

towards  the  construction of  workers'  houses  in

Jurong,  and  $1.5  million in  housing  for  other

industrial  estates. Then, of course, a substantial

amount  will be spent on social amenities, such  as

the  park,  the  aviary, a sports  complex, and  a

public  jetty to facilitate transportation  between

Jurong and some of the southern islands which  have

been  developed  for  industrial  purposes.  These,

broadly,  are the main purposes for which the  loan

money will be used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asks for details of the

acreage of land opened for industrial use, as  well

as the number of outstanding applications. The land

in  Jurong available for industrial use now stands

in  the  region  of  4,000  acres.  The  number  of

outstanding applications varies from time to  time.

I  cannot  give  the exact figure off-hand,  but  I

think it is probably between 40 and 60 applications

which   need   to  have  their  land   requirements

fulfilled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong wants to know whether this

$50  million  loan  will include expenditure  on  a

community  centre. There is an item here  with  the

heading,   "Mosque,  community  centre,  etc."   at

Kampong  Java Teban, and a sum of $20,000 has  been

set aside for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a secondary school for Jurong, no

secondary schools will be built there. Most of  the

workers  there are not married, and those  who  are

married have very young children. In fact, even the

primary school in Jurong has not been filled up. So

it will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



many years before we need secondary schools in  the

estate  itself.  But  there are  secondary  schools

quite close by, for instance, the Jurong Integrated

Secondary  School at 12¼ m.s. Jurong  Road,  the

Yusof  Ishak  Integrated Secondary School  in  West

Coast  Road, and the Toh Tuck lntegrated  Secondary

School  in  Toh  Tuck Road. These  three  secondary

schools are well under capacity, and they may serve

the population of Jurong for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a fire station, no fire station will

be  built in the Jurong industrial estate. There is

a  fire station in Queenstown, and there is another

fire  station  in Bukit Timah. So the necessity  of

having  one  in Jurong is not all that  urgent. In

fact, when the fireworks factory in Jurong blew  up

about a year ago, the fire brigade got there  in  a

very  short time - five minutes, I believe; in  any

case  very much less than 15 minutes. In  fact,  in

the  Development Estimates in one of  the  previous

years,  a  sum of $1.5 million was provided  for  a

fire  brigade. My officials had a look  at  it  and

wondered  whether  there was any justification  for

spending  this  large  sum  of  money  for  a  fire

brigade.  Most  of  the money spent  on  this  fire

brigade  would  be  to  provide  quarters  for  the

firemen.  This is one of the extraordinary features

about Government development projects - the money  is

not  spent  on  items that one would conclude  from

reading the title of the project. For instance,  $5

million  is to be spent on, say, building a prison.

You will find that $4 million will be spent not  on

housing  the  convicts, but on housing  the  prison

staff. It is the same with this vote. I hope we can

develop a system where the firemen will go  to  the

fire  brigade  station according to a duty  roster,

but go home after that. I do not understand why  we

have  to provide accommodation on the site  of  the

fire  brigade station. Certainly in other countries

they  do  not  have  this. So  if  the  Member  for

Havelock  wants to have a fire station  there,  but

without firemen's quarters,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



then  I  think my Ministry will be more willing  to

consider this proposition than otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have a

point to clarify. The Minister for Finance just now

mentioned  the building of a community  centre  and

also  that provision is ear-marked for the building

of  a mosque at Kampong Java Teban. I would like to

point  out that the place is not in Jurong Town.  I

would  like to know whether he intends to  build  a

community centre in the centre of Jurong Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Minister's reply that there is no

need  for a fire station in Jurong Town, I wish  to

say  that  I had an argument with the Minister  for

Social   Affairs  on  this  question.  The  Finance

Minister says that it takes a fire engine only five

minutes to reach the site of the fire. The Minister

for  Social Affairs did say that the firemen  would

take about one minute to be ready to leave the fire

station.  If  that  be  the case,  I  think  it  is

incredible  that the journey from  Bukit  Timah  to

Jurong  could be made within four minutes. In  view

of  this,  I  feel  that perhaps the  Minister  for

Finance will reconsider the need for a fire station

in Jurong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Not for $1.5 million. If the

residents  in  Jurong  are prepared  to  have  fire

services on a more modest scale, where you park one

or  two  engines with the crew on a rotating basis,

then  perhaps I might think it over. This  sort  of

arrangement  will be more reasonable  and  will  be

sufficient to deal with small outbreaks of fires in

the  factories. I do not think we need a large fire

station such as we have in Queenstown or elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the community centre, I do not make

the decision. I think it will be fairer if I do not

decide  such  matters. It is best that  the  Member

take  it  up  with the Jurong Town  Corporation.  I

believe the N.T.U.C. is represented on the Board of

the Jurong Town Corporation, and maybe the N.T.U.C.

representative will listen sympathetically to  what

the Member has to say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in view of the Minister's satisfactory reply, I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 003+.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+ The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs. Teong Eng Siong, Ho Kah Leong and Lim Cheng Lock.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Committee of Supply discussed the

Second   Supplementary  Development  Estimates   of

Expenditure  for  the Financial Year  1st  January,

1969,  to 31st March, 1970, I did raise the subject

of   building  warehouses  for  the  relocation  of

warehouses which are in acute shortage as a  result

of  urban renewal schemes. The Minister for Finance

then   replied   that  warehouses  were   not   the

responsibility  of the Jurong Town  Corporation.  I

hope he will not say again that warehouses are  not

the  responsibility of the Housing and  Development

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I would like to refer to

Hansard,  Vol.  26,  col. 158, dated  7.9.67.  The

Minister for Law and National Development,  in  his

written answer to my question, said, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would like to assure the Honourable Member

that  my  Ministry  has indeed  been  looking  into

various  possibilities of providing more  warehouse

facilities  both in the suburbs and near industrial

areas  to enable commercial houses and distributors

of  merchandise to relocate warehouse  affected  by

urban renewal.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same Hansard, col. 159, the Minister

continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'More investigations and feasibility studies are

being  undertaken by the Urban Renewal  Department.

Eventually, land may have to be reclaimed from  the

sea along Pasir Panjang to provide a warehouse zone

that will be generally acceptable.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two years have passed, and the shortage

of  warehouse  facilities has not been  solved.  In

fact,  it  has now become more acute, as  more  and

more    areas    are    being   decontrolled    for

redevelopment. May I, therefore, ask  the  Minister

concerned  what plans have been made to solve  this

shortage of warehouses in the near future, and what

is  the  progress  of sea reclamation  along  Pasir

Panjang for the warehouse zone?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  moving this amendment, I  wish  to  raise

three   questions.   Firstly,   I   have   received

complaints  from  some tenants of the  Housing  and

Development Board flats that some of the  staff  of

the  Housing and Development Board are discourteous

in   that  when  the  tenants  (probably  they  are

hawkers)  pay  their rents, they use  silver  coins

- either  ten cents or twenty cents coins - and  these

coins are not accepted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, are you dealing with the

right subhead or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It is subhead

003 "Loan to Housing and Development Board".



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, and please concentrate on

subhead   003  "Loan  to  Housing  and  Development

Board".



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if  I  do not raise this matter about  silver

coins  not being accepted by the H.D.B. staff  now,

then  I  will not have the opportunity  to  do  so,

because  in the Development Estimates there  is  no

such item.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the H.D.B. officers refusing to accept

silver  coins from these tenants, I think there  is

no  reason why they should not. Since silver  coins

are  issued by the Government, why should they  not

be accepted by the H.D.B. staff? The only reason is

that  these  officers  are either  discourteous  or

lazy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the complaint is on cleanliness in

H.D.B. flats.  As  far as I know,  the  Government

receives $10 from each unit of flats as maintenance

for its cleanliness. Very often I discover that the

sweepers  do  not do their sweeping  every  day.  I

would  ask the Minister concerned to see  that  the

sweepers do their work conscientiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish to know where the flats will be

built with this loan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have two suggestions for the Minister concerned.

Firstly, can flower troughs be made for the tenants

of  Housing  and  Development Board  flats  to  put

flowers  along  the public corridors  in  order  to

beautify the surroundings? At present they  do  not

have  a  place  to put their potted  plants  except

along  the public corridors. However, this will  be

interfered with by the officers of the Housing  and

Development Board. In order to solve this  problem,

I  hope  that  the  Minister  concerned  will  take

positive measures to enable tenants of H.D.B. flats

to grow potted plants along the public corridors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is this: Will a swill chute

be  provided by the H.D.B, for the tenants to throw

away  their  swill? At present,  they  pour  their

swill into empty tins or cans and leave them in the

common  corridor, thereby raising a stinking smell.

As  a  result,  inspectors  from  the  Housing  and

Development Board will interfere with them,  saying

that this method of disposing of their swill is not

clean  and healthy. In order to solve this problem,

I  would ask the Minister concerned whether he  can

consider  erecting a chute or special container  so

that  the tenants will be able to pour their  swill

down  it.  It  will be more hygienic and  will  not

raise a stinking smell this way. At the moment, the

Housing  and  Development  Board  is  charging  the

collectors  of  swill 10 cents  per  unit  for  the

collection  of  swill. Some farmers who  rear  pigs

will   come  and  collect  it.  If  there  are   no

containers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



for  the  swill, the farmers will not  be  able  to

collect it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, under subhead

003, a sum of $100 million will be provided to the

Housing and Development Board. I believe this sum

will be provided at an interest rate of 7¾ per

cent. The Housing and Development Board, in

assisting persons who wish to own Housing and

Development Board homes, gives loans to persons

purchasing H.D.B. flats at an interest rate of 6¼ per cent. I wonder whether the Minister for

Finance is aware of this subsidy that the people in

Singapore who purchase H.D.B. homes are receiving.

I am quite sure many persons in Singapore who

purchase these homes do not realise the subsidy

they are receiving from the Housing and Development

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to find out from either the Minister

for  Finance  or the Minister for Law and  National

Development whether, in addition to this subsidy of

$15 per $1,000 loan, the houses are sold at cost or

at a profit?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may first deal

with the queries of the Member for Mountbatten.  Up

to  the 31st December of last year, 174 stores  and

warehouses had been cleared or demolished  to  make

way for urban renewal. It has not been possible  to

provide  alternative accommodation as  the  Housing

and  Development Board has not up to date built any

store   or  warehouse  for  resettlement  purposes.

However, most of those evicted have found their own

accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be interested to know that the

State  and  City  Planning Office has  conducted  a

survey of stores and warehouses to gather data  for

the  proposal  to  develop a warehouse  complex  at

Pasir  Panjang. The Port of Singapore Authority  is

also making investigations into the possibility  of

constructing  warehouses within their property.  If

implemented,  store and warehouse  clearance  cases

can  be  offered alternative accommodation  at  the

proposed complex. The Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



also  asked how far work has progressed. The answer

is that the survey has just been completed and work

has not started.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with the Member for Sembawang and

the  Member for Jurong. Somehow the questions  they

asked  me  now  should  have been  directed  at  me

yesterday. Anyhow, I will deal with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complains of discourtesy

- silver coins not being received. Silver coins are

valid  tender and they should be received. If  the

Member  knows  of any particular case,  he  should

give  the  particulars so that the  matter  can  be

investigated. As for cleanliness, it is agreed that

the  standard  of  cleanliness  could  be  further

improved.   The   Board  is   now   exploring   the

possibility   of  establishing  block   and   floor

representatives  to improve the management  and  to

bring about a higher standard of cleanliness in the

Housing and Development Board estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong made remarks about

providing a swill chute in flats to get rid of  the

swill. The problem of collecting swill led to some

difficulties some time ago, but the matter has been

satisfactorily  resolved  by  the  appointment   of

registered   farmers   as   swill   collectors.   I

understand that the collection of swill is done  by

means  of  proper  containers and under  controlled

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for planting flowers, substantial numbers of

flower  troughs have been provided in  Housing  and

Development  Board  estates  for  landscaping   and

beautifying.  The  tenants are also  encouraged  to

keep   potted  plants  to  make  their  flats  more

pleasant, so long as the potte4 plants do not  fall

down to the flat below.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Sembawang wanted to

know  where  we are going to build more flats.  The

answer   is  in  several  places  in  Singapore   - Queenstown,  Toa Payoh, Telok Blangah and  even  on

both sides of Farrer Road.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> The Naval Base?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> No, I am afraid it will take some time

before we reach the Naval Base.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure

the   Minister  is  fully  aware  that  a  lot   of

businessmen store their goods in their own  private

houses  in the residential areas and even in  flats

or  apartments.  Will the various authorities  like

the   Chief  Building  Surveyor's  Department,  the

Ministry  of  Health,  the  Fire  Brigade  and  the

Planning Department be lenient with them in view of

the shortage?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am afraid I cannot speak for the

Fire  Brigade. If there is a fire hazard, the  Fire

Brigade will ask them to move out. There have  been

cases   of  residential  premises  being  used   as

warehouses. Depending on the type of goods  stored,

the   vicinity  and  the  particular  circumstances

temporary approval has been granted in many cases.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, can the Member for

Kampong Kapor quickly recapitulate his questions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, very briefly, what I

wanted to find out from the Minister is whether  he

is  aware  that  the sum of $100 million  is  being

provided to the Housing and Development Board at an

interest  rate of 7¾ per cent, whereas the  Board

is  giving  loans  to purchasers  of  flats  at  an

interest  rate of 6¼ per cent, which means  that

the  Government is subsidising $15 per  $1,000.  In

addition  to  this  subsidy, can the  Minister  say

whether the flats are sold by the Board at cost  or

at a profit?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually, the Government loan

to  the  Housing  and Development Board  takes  two

separate forms: one is a 60-year loan at  7¾ per

cent,  and  the other is a 10-year loan  at  6  per

cent,  which is to finance houses put up  for  sale

under the home ownership scheme. The Board itself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



lends money to purchasers at 6¼ per cent for  15

years.   This  has  been  extended  to  20   years.

Government,  of  course, has been subsidising  this

scheme  all  along. It is in the  general  interest

that we should provide housing on the best possible

terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the sale of flats, the Housing Board

is  not a profit-making body and it sells at  cost,

taking   into  account  administrative  and   other

overheads.  Indeed, because the Housing  Board  has

been  able  to  buy land in the past  at  very  low

rates,  my  guess  is  that  if  you  value   these

properties  at current land values, the  purchasers

would be getting very good value for their money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

004*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some questions on the National

Stadium Corporation for the Minister. What  is  the

object in setting up this Corporation? How will the

provision of $7.8 million be utilised? What is  the

National  Stadium  Corporation's  relation  to  the

National Sports Promotion Board which has yet to be

established?  Will the Kallang Park Sports  Complex

be managed by the corporation? Will the Corporation

also manage other sports stadiums elsewhere in  the

Republic,  such as the Jalan Besar and Farrer  Park

Stadiums?  Finally,  will the Corporation  run  and

manage  small  gymnasiums in various parts  of  the

city for the benefit of our workers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

seek   somewhat  different  information   from   my

colleague,  the Member for Mountbatten. I  remember

that  the National Stadium Complex was supposed  to

get its financial support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



from  profits  derived  from  the  setting  up   of

Singapore Pools (Pte.) Limited. In this respect,  I

shall be grateful if the Minister for Finance  will

disclose  to this House how much has been collected

by  Singapore Pools (Pte.) Ltd, in respect  of  the

two  lotteries  they run - Toto and  the  Singapore

Sweep.  How  much  of  the  collections  have  been

ploughed  back  into the National Stadium?  As  the

Member for Mountbatten has mentioned, I believe the

Corporation has not been set up. In fact, the  Bill

is  still with the Select Committee. How much  will

it  cost  us  when the National Stadium Complex  is

completed? Can the Minister assure this House  that

it will not be another white elephant?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I hope I can remember all

the questions that have been raised. First, what is

this National Stadium Corporation? This has yet  to

be  set up and the Corporation will look after  the

National Stadium. Whether it will look after  other

stadiums and whether it will establish gymnasiums I

will not venture to predict. But the Corporation is

quite  different from the National Sports Promotion

Board  which  is to promote sports. The Corporation

will manage the National Stadium and one hopes that

it  will prevent the stadium from becoming a  white

elephant. It might well become a white elephant, as

the Member for Punggol has said, but one hopes that

that would not be the case.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How much has been paid for

this  project from Singapore Pools? A sum  of  $4.2

million  was  contributed from Toto operations  and

$1.8 million came from the profits of the Singapore

Sweep.  This  gives  a total  of  $6  million.  The

stadium  will eventually cost $18 million  and  the

first stage of the project will be completed by the

middle  of 1972. Whether Singapore Pools will  make

profits fast enough to pay the contractors, I would

not know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of over $1.7 million is for

the  construction of a luxury hotel adjacent to the

Hotel and Catering Training Centre. In view of  the

overbuilding of private hotels, I wish to  ask  the

Minister for Labour whether it is prudent  for  the

Government  to  go  into the hotel  business  on  a

commercial  basis  in competition  with  the  other

hotels.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

presume  that  what  the Member for  Kampong  Kapor

wants  to find out from me is whether it is prudent

for  the  Government to go into the hotel business.

Sir,  anything that the Government does  is  always

prudent. In this particular case, this is a  hotel-cum-training  centre. If we have  to  provide  some

10,600 persons who will be required to service  our

fast-expanding hotel industry by 1972, then  it  is

necessary  that  there should  be  some  systematic

training  of staff. And this hotel - it  is  to  be

called   Hotel  Premier -  is  mainly  for  training

people. We are not going into competition with  the

private hotels. I mentioned this project to some of

the hoteliers and they were quite grateful that the

Government  is undertaking the task of providing  a

school and a hotel where potential hotel staff will

get  in-service training while they are on the job.

At  present,  they are trained and  have  to  learn

their   business   in  established   hotels   which

sometimes  do not add very much to the prestige  or

the  efficiency of the hotels. Therefore, there  is

no  question  of  Government going into  the  hotel

business. After all, there are only 30 bedrooms  in

this  hotel. In fact, far from offering competition

to  the private hotels, this hotel will enhance the

efficiency  and  possibly the  profits  of  private

hotels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a graduate of Nanyang University, I am

glad to see that more and more financial assistance

is being given to the University. Under this item.

the Government intends to spend about $700,000 on

the sports complex, and this is heartening news.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the building of this complex, I

recall that it began when I was still in the

University. At that time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



only the land was levelled. The complex is about to

be  completed. I hope the students will make use of

its training facilities and build up their bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to ask a few questions on the

development of Nanyang University. We read from the

press that a College for Post-Graduate Studies  was

set up on the 20th of this month.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the sports complex and

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> I withdraw my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

205.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving,

<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead concerns new primary schools. That

the Government has not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



made  proper plans for building new schools can  be

seen  from the fact that in Tiong Bahru places  for

children in the primary schools are not sufficient.

As  a result, many pupils are being sent to distant

schools. This is causing a lot of inconvenience  to

the pupils as well as the parents. We know that the

Government is providing $100 million to the Housing

and  Development Board to build high-rise flats  in

the  Tiong Bahru, Delta and Alexandra areas.  After

the Housing Board has built the flats,  there  will

be  more people staying in these areas. There  will

then   be  a  serious  problem  of  finding  school

accommodation  for the children. I  wonder  whether

the  Government has any plans to build more schools

in these areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

true  that the Government has not properly  planned

its  school building programme to cater for the new

housing  estates  that are springing  up  all  over

Singapore.  It  is  a case of financial  stringency

rather than poor planning. In fact, in many of  the

new  Housing Board estates, school sites have  been

reserved but we have not been able to build schools

because  of  financial reasons.  There  are  enough

school  places  in  Singapore  to  cater  for   all

children of school-going age. The problem  is  that

there  have been such a lot of population movements

from  the  centre  of the city to the  new  Housing

Board estates that the schools in the centre of the

city  have vacancies, whereas in the Housing  Board

estates there are children of school-going age  but

no  schools. I am afraid this problem will  persist

for  quite  a  long time to come unless  funds  are

available.  As  I said just now,  in  view  of  the

financial stringency which my Ministry is  required

to exercise, new primary schools will only be built

in areas where there is very extensive resettlement

or  the  building of new flats by the  Housing  and

Development Board or where replacement schools have

to be provided because of urban renewal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are no doubt aware of the

very small provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



allocated  for  the  development  of  new   primary

schools in this year's estimates. The provision  is

sufficient for the construction of only one primary

school,  which  is  now being built  in  MacPherson

Housing  Estate where an acute shortage of  primary

school  places is being experienced largely because

of   intensive   building  by   the   Housing   and

Development  Board  in this area  during  the  last

couple of years. With no funds being made available

to  us,  and  as  there  has  been  no  substantial

building of new Housing and Development Board flats

in  the  Tiong  Bahru area, there are no  immediate

plans  for the building of primary schools in  that

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, a 10-storey primary

school  with an enrolment capacity of 2,800 is  now

being   built   in  Chin  Swee  Road  in   Havelock

Constituency to replace two very old schools, Sepoy

Lines  Malay  School and Pearl's Hill School.  They

will  soon  have to be demolished to  give  way  to

urban renewal.

"Land  Acquisition for Technical Education".  There

is a provision of $500,000 and, of course, as usual

it  is subject to Treasury sanction. I notice  also

that there is a revote of $311,800. I would like to

seek clarification on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



location  of  the land which will be  required  for

technical education purposes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  sum  is  provided to pay for the  land  which

belongs  to the Housing and Development  Board.  It

has  been  taken over by the Ministry of  Education

for the development of the Vocational Institute  at

Bukit Merah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I have been told - rightly or

wrongly - by  the Parliamentary Secretary  just  now

that  this provision is for the Vocational Training

institute.  Would he care to elaborate  further  on

the term "Vocational Training Institute"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, actually I

used  the  term  "Vocational  Institute"  and   not

"Vocational   Training   Institute".    With    the

introduction of the modular system of  training  at

the  beginning of this year, all the various  types

of training institutes have become unified into one

type.  In  fact,  all  of them will  henceforth  be

referred   to   as   vocational  institutes   where

instruction  in  a vocation will be  given  to  the

trainees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that case,

what   is   the  difference  between  a  vocational

institute  and  a  technical  institute?  In  other

words,  what  is  the difference in  the  level  of

instruction between the two types of institute?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the vocational institute

will  teach more "how" and the technical  institute

will teach more "why". They differ in the skill and

theoretical  content  of a  particular  trade.  The

technical institute will train craft technicians at

a level which is slightly below that of a technical

college  and the vocational institute  is  for  the

training of craftsmen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this concerns

the  conversion  of schools. Under these  subheads

one  can  see  the following titles: subhead  701,

"Construction   of   Centralised   Workshops   for

Academic  Schools"; subhead 702, "Modification  of

Multi-Purpose  Schools  Workshops";  subhead  703,

"Conversion  of Academic/Vocational  Schools  into

of Technical School Workshops". I have been trying

to  find  out  more about these  titles  from  the

Memorandum   on  the  Development   Estimates   of

Singapore for the financial year 1st April,  1970,

to  31st March, 1971 (Misc. 2 of 1970), but I have

not been able to get any clear picture of the type

of   conversion  or  construction.  I   hope   the

Parliamentary Secretary will elaborate further and

inform this House of the exact nature of the  work

to be undertaken this year and next year.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

surprised   that   explanatory   notes   on   this

conversion   are  not  found  in  the  Development

Estimates,  because they are all  contained  in  a

booklet which was tabled in Parliament last  year.

In  this  booklet, entitled One Year of  Technical

Education,   we   did   lay  down   the   proposed

reorganisation whereby all boys and 50 per cent of

the girls in Secondary I and II are required to go

for  three hours' training per week in metal  work

together    with   either   woodwork   or    basic

electricity. As such, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



have to provide sufficient workshops to cater  for

this new subject that has been introduced for  the

first time in the secondary school curriculum.  As

most  of the academic schools do not have a  work.

shop,  and  as  this subject requires  only  three

hours  per week of training, we find it is  better

to  locate all the facilities in one central place

to be known as a centralised workshop to cater for

a  cluster of schools in that area. There are some

14  administrative units of centralised  workshop,

each  of  which  will consist of four  metal,  two

woodwork  and two electricity workshops, and  will

cater for some 3,200 students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same set-up goes for the Multi-Purpose

school which was first established in 1964.  This,

school  provides, in addition to a  classroom  and

science  laboratory, facilities for art and  craft

work,  domestic  science  teaching  and  technical

education.  This will enable all  students  to  be

educated according to their interest, ability, and

aptitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this new workshop

training in Secondary I and II curricula,  it  was

decided that the technical workshop at these Multi-Purpose  schools  should  be  converted   into   a

centralised workshop to cater for Secondary I  and

II academic school students living in that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of academic/vocational schools, the

conversion  is  of  a slightly  different  nature.

Since   1969  we  have  abolished  all  vocational

schools  and integrated them with the neighbouring

academic schools into a bilateral school, which is

a  school consisting actually of two streams,  one

technical and the other academic. This will  allow

both  streams of education to come under the  same

administrative head. And the vote asked for is  to

provide   additional  facilities  to  enable   the

student  to  go right up to Technical III  and  IV

levels in the technical stream.

furniture  production, electrical craft technician,

refrigeration,  air conditioning,  and  engineering

drawing. All these courses leading to the award  of

a   Craft  Technician  Diploma  which,  as  I  have

explained earlier, is slightly lower than that of a

Technical  College. Polytechnic and  the  Ngee  Ann

Technical  College, in the sense that  the  courses

that  these Colleges conduct have a slightly higher

theory   content  than  those  of   the   Singapore

Technical Institute.



The  Singapore Technical Institute at  the  present

moment  is functioning temporarily in the Singapore

Vocational  Institute at Balestier Road.  Proposals

for its future development have been finalised, and

it   has   been  decided  to  house  the  Singapore

Technical Institute permanently at a site  provided

near  the  MacPherson  Housing  Estate,  which  was

formerly  earmarked  for the MacPherson  Vocational

Institute. Within this same complex, it  will  also

house  the  Technical Department of  the  Teachers'

Training College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Singapore Technical Institute was only

established at the beginning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



of 1969, it has not produced any graduates yet. The

present enrolment is 240, and when the Institute is

fully   operational  on  completion  of   the   new

building, it will have a maximum enrolment of 1,000

full-time and 1,000 part-time students.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in that case, when will the

Institute be completed?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  building  for  the  Institute  will   be

completed by April next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1101.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am not moving amendment

(11).



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (12) then, Mr Ng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1202.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe this is a contribution to the

Polytechnic. For last year there was only  a  token

contribution of $10, but for this year a  sum  of

slightly more than $1.5 million is asked for  Works

and Buildings and Furniture and Equipment. Will the

Minister kindly indicate to this House what sort of

Works and Buildings will entail such a high cost?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, to meet the increasing

demand   for  technicians  as  a  result   of   our

industrialisation programme, there  is  a  need  to

expand  the School of Industrial Technology at  the

Polytechnic.  As we are all aware, the  Polytechnic

is  at present sited at Prince Edward Road, and  it

has no room for expansion. The only alternative  is

to  put up additional buildings to cope temporarily

with    the    increasing   intake   of   students.

Consequently the Polytechnic obtained permission to

use the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



land  opposite its present site for the purpose  of

putting  up additional temporary structures  for  a

workshop,  draughting  room, offices,  and  lecture

rooms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polytechnic has agreed that emphasis in the

teaching  should be aimed at practical  application

rather   than  theoretical  principles.  This   has

resulted in the introduction of a new course  known

as    the   General   Certificate   of   Industrial

Technology.  The intake for this particular  course

has  increased substantially for the  coming  year.

This  has  necessitated the provision of additional

workshop  and laboratory facilities, and additional

equipment  will be required for the new course.  It

is  estimated  that  about  $1.5  million  will  be

required  for works and buildings, and  another  $1

million   approximately  will   be   required   for

furniture  and  equipment. In addition,  a  sum  of

about  $76,000 is needed to compensate the Ministry

of  Interior  and  Defence for  vacating  the  land

opposite the Polytechnic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned just now that

the  works  and  buildings will be of  a  temporary

nature  to  cope  with  the increasing  demand  for

places  in  the  Polytechnic. I  believe  that  the

additional  buildings for the  Polytechnic  on  its

present  site will not be sufficient and  there  is

contemplation    to   re-site   the    Polytechnic.

Therefore,   this   being   the   case,   can   the

Parliamentary  Secretary say  whether  or  not  the

Polytechnic, together with the Singapore  Technical

Institute  which will be completed by  1971,  could

provide  sufficient places, in spite of the present

crash  programme of building additional  works  and

buildings? Under these circumstances, Sir, I  would

be  grateful  if the Parliamentary Secretary  could

also  indicate  where the new Polytechnic  will  be

sited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> In Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Certainly, Sir, not in Punggol.

I  would  rather prefer Punggol to  be  a  peaceful

area, without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



all   the   banging  going  on  in  the   machinery

workshops. Anyway, my question is this: with the re-siting   of   the  Polytechnic,  the  emphasis   on

technical education will inevitably be greater.  So

should  we  not start off on this new  site  rather

than  spend more than $1 .5 million on these  works

and buildings as a temporary measure?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully

agree with the Member for Punggol. Unfortunately we

cannot  yet locate an ideal site for the  Singapore

Polytechnic. Of this $1½ million, not all will  be

lost  when the Polytechnic moves to the new site  - if  we  ever  locate  one  -  because  the  present

facilities are of a movable nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, there is a vocational institute in

Punggol Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg to correct the last

sentence.   The  vocational  secondary  school   in

Punggol does not exist any more. It is now known as

the Punggol Industrial Training Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has not given me

a  satisfactory reply with regard to the  re-siting

of  the  Polytechnic. He says that he has not  been

able  to  locate an ideal site for the Polytechnic.

But  can  he assure this House that vigorous  steps

will  be  taken to ensure that the construction  of

the  Polytechnic  will not  be  too  far  into  the

future?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> If I may reply, Mr Speaker, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if plans for moving the

University   of   Singapore  to  Kent   Ridge   are

implemented, then the Polytechnic may move  to  the

present site of the University. When the University

moves,  we must find a use for the present building

and  grounds.  In  my view, the present  University

site would be the best site for the Polytechnic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the

Minister for Law and National Development  for  his

intervention and very good suggestion. And I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



hope the Minister for Education will take this into

serious  consideration.  Under  the  circumstances,

Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 41

be reduced by $100*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision for this Head

exceeds  $22  million. Some of this money  will  be

used  to  build technical schools and buy equipment

and  machinery. Such a big provision  is  necessary

because  we  are now in the midst of expanding  our

technical  education so as to train more  and  more

technical  personnel.  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister a few questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I have received complaints that the

machinery  in certain vocational institutes  breaks

down very often. This machinery is all very new but

it  breaks  down  after a short time  and  is  left

unattended  to for a long period. This  is  a  very

grave  defect. The Minister should see to  it  that

his  Ministry  rectify the defect of not  repairing

machinery immediately it breaks down. I think it is

not  only a waste of public money, but it  is  also

obstructing the studies of the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the teaching aids and other equipment

in  the  vocational schools are always missing.  It

seems  that the administration of these schools  is

not  very  satisfactory. Teachers are not  able  to

take  care  of  this expensive equipment.  This  is

another example of waste of public money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as we have so many technical and

vocational   institutes,  we  must  also   have   a

sufficient  number  of teachers.  The  teachers  in

these  institutes  have  to  teach  their  subjects

through the medium of English, as many of the terms

are in English. Therefore, these teachers must have

a high standard of English so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



they  are able to communicate to the students what

they  teach.  I  do not know whether the  Technical

Education  Department has any plans to improve  the

standard of English of these teachers so that  they

will  not be faced with difficulties when they give

instruction to their students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, inspectors from the Technical Education

Department seldom visit these technical institutes.

Therefore,   if   the  teachers  are   faced   with

difficulties, they are not able to get proper  help

and guidance from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, does the Minister intend to build a

vocational  or  technical institute  at  Sembawang?

This  is  because  there is  a  naval  base  and  a

shipyard there. As the Government intends to  build

factories  there, the building of a  vocational  or

technical institute will facilitate the training of

skilled workers to man these factories.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to ask the

Minister   several   questions  regarding   Nanyang

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From press reports, we know that a College for

Post-Graduate  Studies was set up on  the  20th  of

this month. It is a milestone in the development of

Nanyang University. We welcome the setting  up  of

the  college  because it will help  to  train  more

professional  people  to serve  our  country.  This

college  requires a big sum of money to  carry  out

its  activities. For example, it must at least have

a   good  building.  However,  in  the  Development

Estimates of 1970-71, I have not been able to  find

a  provision  for  this College  for  Post-Graduate

Studies.  I  would  like to  know  what  steps  the

Government intends to take towards the expansion of

this College for Post-Graduate Studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his financial statement, the Minister for

Finance  says  the  Government intends  to  recruit

overseas scholars and professional people  to  work

here.  Of course, the material incentives here  are

not comparable to those abroad. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



if these scholars want to come and serve here, they

do  so  with  a  sense  of  dedication.  We  should

therefore   provide  them  with   suitable   living

accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the setting up of Nanyang University,

many  of  the quarters for the teaching staff  have

not  been  renovated. For example, the dormitories

have  not  been renovated. I think it is time  they

should  be  renovated. With the setting up  of  the

College  for Post-Graduate Studies, this renovation

should be undertaken now. I hope the Minister  will

ask for more money from his colleague, the Minister

for  Finance.  From  the financial  policy  of  the

Minister for Finance, we know that, because of  the

rapid industrialisation programme, we need not only

technicians but also managerial and high  executive

personnel to man our industries. There is  a  great

shortage of such talents. Many of our graduates who

have  gone abroad for higher studies have not  come

back.  We  should adopt the policy of  using  local

talents to teach in Nanyang University. What  plans

does  the  University  have to  encourage  its  own

graduates  who have gone abroad for higher  studies

to  come  back  and take over the key positions  in

Nanyang University?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago the Minister, in answering my

question, stated that Nanyang University asked  for

$20,000 to improve its ventilation facilities. I do

not know whether such a provision has been made  to

improve   the  ventilation  facilities  at  Nanyang

University.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the query by the Member for Sembawang regarding the

damage   to   the   machinery  at  the   vocational

institutes, I would like to say that the  technical

education programme has expanded so rapidly that we

find  it  a bit difficult to maintain the machinery

which  happens  to break down almost  at  the  same

time.  Formerly, the minor maintenance of machinery

was  done  by  our own craft teachers and  workshop

instructors, and major faults were repaired by  the

P.W.D. Owing to the sudden increase in machinery in

our technical institutions and its intensive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



usage, the  P.W.D. has  not been able to  cope  with  the

requests  for repair immediately. As a result,  the

Ministry  has set up a maintenance unit to  relieve

some of the burden on the P.W.D.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's query regarding the language

of  instruction, I am quite sure he is fully  aware

that  even  in  secondary schools, Mathematics  and

Science are being taught in English. Therefore,  it

is  reasonable  that technical subjects  should  be

taught  in  English.  As  I  said  just  now,  when

answering  a query from the Member for Punggol,  in

the  technical institutions the instruction is more

in  the  acquisition of skills  and  therefore  the

language of instruction is not a crucial point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also raised a query

about   inspectors  from  the  Technical  Education

Department  not visiting the technical institutions

as  often  as the other academic schools.  I  think

this  will be much to the relief of the Member  for

Paya  Lebar, who  is  rather  worried  about  - the

frequent visits of these inspectors to the  schools

in his constituency!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Technical education is managed in a different

way.  The  Principal  of  the  Singapore  Technical

Institute,  who is a professional officer,  has  an

almost  autonomous  say  in  the  running  of   the

Institute.  The  Education  Ministry  is  presently

running  a management course for all principals  of

vocational institutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the demand for skilled workers arises in

Sembawang, we will look into the establishment of a

vocational institute there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry

has supported the setting up of a College for Post-Graduate  Studies  because it will  provide  proper

research  facilities for the staff.  Only  a  small

establishment  will  be required  because  research

will  be  done  by  the academic staff  from  other

departments who will be attached to the college  as

Senior  Fellows  or Fellows. The  number  of  post-graduate  students is expected  to  be  small,  and

admission  will  be  very  selective.  A  sum  of

$46,000 has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



included    in   the   $3.5   million    Government

contribution   to  Nanyang  University   for   this

purpose. This will cover the honoraria for the Dean

of   the  college,  for  the  four  heads  of   the

institute,  and  remuneration  for  technical   and

general staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as capital development of the College of

Post-Graduate  Studies  is concerned,  it  will  be

carried  out  in  two phases, and  a  sum  of  $1.2

million is required. So far, Nanyang University has

raised $300,000 for the first phase. Meanwhile  the

University  has asked Government for a  dollar-for-dollar grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has always been the accepted policy of Nanyang

University,  since reorganisation began  over  five

and  a half years ago, to build up a corps of local

academic staff so that the University can be  fully

developed   to  fulfil  its  role  as  a   national

university. What Nanyang University will become  in

the  years ahead depends largely on the calibre  of

the  academic  staff.  This  policy  has  not  been

changed.  I  am  sure  that the  administrators  of

Nanyang  University  are implementing  this  policy

with understanding and vigour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Estimates, Government provided

$3.89  million  to Nanyang University.  This  grant

included   a  sum  of  $220,000  for  repairs   and

renovation  to student hostels and staff  quarters,

including replacement of furniture. Another sum  of

$220,000 for a similar purpose is included  in  the

Government contribution of $3.5 million this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the installation of ten additional exhaust-fans and numerous wall-fans early last year, the

ventilation of the auditorium has improved  and  it

is   tolerable   under   normal   conditions.   The

University    authorities   are   now   considering

improving the ventilation of the stage. The Hokkien

Huay  Kuan  contributed $100,000 in  1968  for  the

improvement of the auditorium.

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 51 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 51 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of $3 million is for the

redevelopment of the passenger terminal building,

and I think this project is very necessary for the

development of tourism, because the number of

tourists coming to Singapore is increasing year by

year. I have several questions to ask. Firstly,

when will this project be completed? Secondly, what

are the facilities that will be provided in this

building? Thirdly, how many passengers can the

building accommodate? Fourthly, what are the

improved services that will be provided for the

tourists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully agree

with the proposal to redevelop the passenger

terminal building. I believe that the number of

passengers entering and leaving Singapore is

increasing. Hence there is a need to redevelop the

building which, I understand, will be completed in

late 1971. In this respect. I would suggest to the

Minister for Communications that in redeveloping

the passenger terminal building, consideration

should be given to the improvement of the transit

lounges. In other words, we should provide better

facilities for passengers in transit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, can the Minister say whether there

is an intention to develop the terminal building in

the  same way as in some other countries where  the

planes   are  parked  just  next  to  the  terminal

building  and the passengers can simply  walk  down

the  gangways right into the terminal building? For

example,  like the terminal buildings in  New  York

and  Schipol in Amsterdam. This would more  or  less

relieve  the  passengers from having to  come  down

from  the plane, get into buses or coaches  and  be

transported to the terminal building.

In   other  words,  we  want  a  modern  passenger

terminal building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as explained in the

Memorandum   on   the  Development   Estimates   of

Singapore (Misc. 2 of 1970) which was tabled by the

Minister for Finance on the 5th of March, 1970,  at

page  4,  Head  51  -Civil Aviation  -  the  second

paragraph says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The major project will be the redevelopment of

the  Passenger  Terminal Building, for  which  $3.0

million is provided. This project is scheduled  for

completion by late 1971.'



<br><br>That is in reply to the first question posed by the

Member for Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the facilities which will be provided

when   the   extension  to  the  present  passenger

terminal  building is completed, we  hope  to  have

approximately double the present floor  space,  and

the  biggest  increase will be in the arrival  area

which  will comprise two floors. There is provision

for  two  jumbo-jets - the 747s - to nose into  the

building so that passengers will just walk  out  of

the  plane  on  to  the landing.  In  addition,  of

course,   there  will  be  other  facilities   like

conveyor belts for baggages to be conveyed  to  the

customs hail on the ground floor. I think all  this

while  there have been a good number of  complaints

about  the  delay in baggage handling  and  we  are

making  an  effort  to modernise  the  handling  of

baggages   with  the  extension  to  our  passenger

terminal  building. In all, there will be five  new

conveyor belts installed with the possibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



of  another two being added on at  a  later

stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the arrivals wing, there will be a roof-top waving deck for people to say "bye bye" to

those  taking leave or on their arrival which  will

be  an improvement over the present waving gallery.

This  will  be a roof-top waving deck and  I  think

they will be able to enjoy a panoramic view of  our

airport, and also have light refreshments and meals

as  we intend to have a partial open-air restaurant

at this place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are hoping that this improved passenger

terminal  building  will be able  to  handle  three

million passengers per annum, which is three  times

the present number of one million per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, when this project is completed, we

shall  have  a  very  much  improved  international

airport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 52 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Lim Soo Peng -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated

for Head 52 be reduced by $100.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> I am not moving,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $522,400 for Head 52 ordered to stand

part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 53 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (1). Mr Ng Yeow Chong is

not here. Mr Teong Eng Siong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 53 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 404.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of $10 million is for the

setting up of a Satellite Earth Station, which is

an important project because we are now entering

the space age. And there is a need to set up a

Satellite Earth Station in Singapore so as to keep

Singapore in touch with other countries. In this

connection, I would like to raise four questions.

First, why are we so slow in establishing this

station? Second, when will it be completed? Third,

when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



it  is completed, what benefits will it provide for

Singapore? And, fourth, who is building it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to

the Member's first question why we appear to be  so

slow  in establishing this Satellite Earth Station,

I would like to assure him that the sum involved is

$10  million  and  one does not try  to  spend  $10

million  rather quickly, at least not in Singapore.

As  there are lots of technical details involved in

the  building  of a highly technical  project  like

this, it is better to hasten slowly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the date when we expect to have this

station completed, I would like to say that  public

tenders for the building of this station closed  in

November last year and it has taken the last  three

months to evaluate them. The official evaluation is

now  complete and the file is now in my office.  As

and  when  the  Senior Tenders Board has  made  its

award, we hope to have the station completed within

a year. That means it will be by April 1971.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member's third question as to the

benefits  that  will  accrue  from  building   this

station,  I  would like to say  that  although  at

present    Singapore   has   a    very    efficient

telecommunications system, we are beginning to find

that our facilities are not quite able to cope with

the  demands  required of them.  Therefore,  it  is

necessary  to  have  this modern  earth  satellite

station. We believe that it will bring us a lot  of

benefits   in  that  the  most  modern  method   of

telecommunication  will be made  available  to  the

commercial  world  as well as  to  members  of  the

public.  We expect the returns will be of a sizable

amount.  We estimate that during the first year  of

operation  we  might make as much  as  $70,000  net

profit.  In  the second year it would be  $970,000,

which  is almost a million dollars, and the  third

year  over $2 million. The benefits, from the point

of view of financial gain will be considerable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's last question is, who will build

this   earth  satellite  station?  That   will   be

determined  by the Senior Tenders Board.  When  the

award is made, we will know which company has been

successful in the tender. It is a bit early for  me

now   to   disclose  the  name  of  the  successful

tenderer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, since the Minister has explained that this

will be a profitable project, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 53 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 502.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $15,178,560 for Head 53 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 55 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 55 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 61 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for this subhead is about $51

million.  This is for the expansion  of  our  Armed

Forces  and  Police. We are now  strengthening  our

defence  establishment  in  order  to  ensure   our

independence and security. This is very  important.

Can the Minister tell the House how this vote is to

be spent?

Head 71 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 71 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 301*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this vote involves a sum of $1,250,000 for

"Works and Buildings" and "Furniture and Equipment"

for the "New Radio Studios and Office Buildings".

Can the Minister answer the following questions:

(1) When will the construction of the buildings be

completed? (2) What kind of facilities will be

provided in these buildings? (3)Will there be any

improvement in the broadcasting services after the

completion of these buildings?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Sembawang wants to know when the  construction

of  the  buildings will be completed. It is planned

that the project will take two years to complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked what facilities will be

provided. Provision is made for the construction of

new   radio  studios  and  office  buildings.   The

facilities   that  will  be  provided   are   those

connected with radio studios. Therefore,  they  are

factors   involving  special  accoustic   treatment

required  for broadcasting studios; that is,  there

will  be sound-proof doors, accoustic treatment  of

walls   and  ceilings,  cables,  ducts   and   air-conditioning  requirements  and  also  broadcasting

studio  equipment  of professional  standard.  Then

there   will  be  an  auditorium,  five  continuity

studios for the four language-channel service and a

F.M. stereophonic service, three "talk studios" and

four  general  purpose and music  studios  for  the

production  of local programmes and  also  for  the

Master Control Room. The last project that will  be

required  is  the transfer of telephone  lines  and

cables  which  are  used to  send  programmes  from

Broadcasting House studios to the transmitting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



station in Jurong and the purchase of a diesel

stand-power generating plant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's last question is whether these new

projects  will  increase efficiency.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  of  course,  the additional  facilities  will

provide  a bigger-sized auditorium which will  seat

350  people  for audience-participation  shows  and

there  is  an  increase in size for music  studios.

There  will  be  technical  improvements  and   the

introduction of new systems designed to  facilitate

production work. Planning for the project will also

take  note of future development; that is  to  say,

there will be one additional continuity studio  for

news  service and one additional music and  general

purpose   studio.  The  increase   of   operational

efficiency  and improvement of technical  standards

will  no  doubt  assist  the  programme  staff   in

producing better programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Minister has explained the projects and

also promised to improve the programmes. I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns the Junior Approved

School.  I  believe I have another  amendment*  on Head  141 -

U.K. Financial Assistance Schemes. This refers  to  the same topic I am going  to  discuss

now.  I  will not be moving my amendment  to  Head

141.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 141 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 401.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek further clarification

on  the type of Junior Approved School that is  to

be   constructed  and  which  is  expected  to  be

completed either this year or next year. This work

will   be  undertaken  with  financial  assistance

amounting  to  $175,000 from the  United  Kingdom.

Perhaps  the  Minister  for  Social  Affairs  will

elaborate on what this Junior Approved School  is.

I  find  that  what  it says  on  page  7  of  the

Memorandum   on  the  Development   Estimates   of

Singapore is not very clear to me.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Junior Approved

School  will  be sited at Clementi Road,  next  to

Ngee  Ann  College. It will comprise two units  of

building.  The  first unit is the Junior  Approved

School  which  will replace the  existing  Welfare

School for Boys at Keppel Road. It is the one that

we  have at the moment. It will consist of a  two-storey  building with dormitory accommodation  and

toilet  facilities on the first floor for 80  boys

using  double-decker  beds. The  offices,  stores,

workroom, kitchen and dinning room facilities will

be  on  the  ground floor. We are not  giving  any

facilities for staff quarters, but there will be a

night duty room for the watchman there.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second unit will be a remand home which will

replace   the   present  very  inadequate   remand

facilities  in  the Gimson School for  Boys.  This

remand home will be built adjacent to the approved

school   and   will  consist  of  a  single-storey

building with accommodation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



for 32 boys in two dormitories separated by a

multi-purpose    hall.    If    necessary,     the

accommodation could be increased to  64  by  again

using double-decker beds. There will also be  four

individual cells for difficult cases, and a  small

office  with quarters attached for one residential

staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it necessary to build this school? The

reason is that there is a need to provide separate

training  facilities for young offenders below  14

years of age and also older ones between the  ages

of 14 and 19. Each of these two groups requires  a

different  type of training, and the  Department's

efforts  to  rehabilitate  delinquents  would   be

seriously   jeopardised   if   relatively    young

offenders  were to be accommodated and trained  in

the same setting as the older hard-core offenders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, just one more question.

Will  the  Minister consider accepting  into  this

Junior Approved School, when it is completed,  not

only  delinquents referred to the juvenile courts,

but  also  those  children whose parents  have  no

control over them?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Those admitted to this school

are  delinquents  taken off the  courts.  For  the

other  categories of boys, there are  other  homes

which can accommodate them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the answers

given by the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noted that a sum of $80,000 is

provided  for  the building of a creche  at  Taman

Jurong,   i.e.,  Jurong  Town.  In   moving   this

amendment,  Sir, I merely want to seek information

from  the Minister as to how and when this  creche

will be constructed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, this sum of $80,000 as

stated  in the Development Estimates is a provision

to be released by Government on a dollar-for-dollar

basis towards the cost of the proposed Taman Jurong

Creche.  A tentative site measuring about 210  feet

by  146 feet at Taman Jurong has been earmarked for

this project. The site is ideal, as working mothers

may  walk to the creche, leave their children there

to  be  taken care of, catch a bus and go to  work.

And  on their way back, they can stop there,  fetch

their children and go home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to when the creche can be completed, I have

not  seen  the money yet and, therefore, I  am  not

able  to  say. But as soon as we get the money,  we

will start building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

his explanation, and I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 90 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noted that the vote for this subhead

amounts  to  $540,000. This is a new  vote,  and  I

would like to ask the Minister why there is a  need

for  it  and  for  what purpose it  will  be  used.

Moreover, in what way will the use of this vote  by

the Survey Department benefit our country?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, national mapping is

a Government responsibility and compatible with our

independent status. It is essential that we have at

our  disposal  facilities for  such  mapping  work.

Hitherto,  Singapore  maps  were  produced  by  the

Surveyor-General, the Director of National Mapping,

Malaysia, and, to a lesser extent, by the Assistant

Director of Surveys of the United Kingdom Services,

as   we   did  not  have  these  facilities.   This

arrangement was expedient so long as the  Singapore

Survey Department was pan-Malaysian and came  under

the  Surveyor-General, Malaya,  and  as  a  Federal

department  when Singapore was a constituent  state

of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On separation from Malaysia, the responsibility

for  the  production of all Singapore maps fell  on

the  Chief Surveyor, Singapore. However, since  our

Survey   Department  did  not  have  the  necessary

facilities,  both  in  respect  of  equipment   and

personnel, all Singapore maps have been printed  by

the   Malaysian  Directorate  of   Mapping   on   a

commercial  basis.  This  arrangement  is   clearly

unsatisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current demand for mapping from numerous

departments  and  statutory  bodies,  such  as  the

Planning  Department, the Public Works  Department,

the  Ministry  of  Health,  the  Land  Office,  the

Housing   and   Development  Board,  the   Economic

Development Board, the Jurong Town Corporation, the

Public   Utilities Board,  the   Bases   Economic

Conversion Department, and the Ministry of Interior

and  Defence,  has come about as a  result  of  the

accelerated  rate  of planning and  development  in

various  fields.  Maps are a prerequisite  for  all

planning and development projects and for effective

and efficient administration. The setting up of the

Mapping   Unit   in  the  Survey   Department   is,

therefore, a vital necessity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $540,000 represents the full capital

cost  of  the  purchase of comprehensive  equipment

needed to operate an independent Mapping Unit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



The various items, if the Member is interested,

are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations are in hand to obtain some of the

equipment at the Dover Road Mapping Unit of the

British Services when their facilities are

transferred to the Singapore Government at the end

of this year. If the Member is interested, the

establishment of the Mapping Unit will require a

staff of 57 under the Chief Surveyor.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, Sir, I am trying to

seek  information  from  the  Minister  as  to  the

intention of the Land Office to purchase  Chip  Bee

Gardens,   Married  Quarters  Estate.   What   does

Government  propose to do with this estate  in  the

future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Chip Bee Gardens is

an  estate along North Buona Vista Road and Holland

Road,  near  Holland Village. It comprises  terrace

houses and shophouses with flats above. In 1963 the

United   Kingdom   Services  Authorities   obtained

permission   from  the  Singapore   Government   to

negotiate  with the developers for  a  lease  of  a

portion  of  this  property when  built,  with  the

option  to  purchase it if the owners  declined  to

lease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estate was developed by the owners, the

United Development and Finance Co. Ltd., under  the

terms  of  agreement between the  company  and  the

Services  Lands  Board, as  a  housing  estate  for

Service families. However, before formal conveyance

and transfer of this property to the Services Lands

Board  was  completed, the pull-out was  announced.

The  Service authorities then considered  reverting

to  a  hiring agreement which would have  left  the

property  in  the  legal ownership  of  the  United

Development and Finance Co. Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following discussions, the Singapore Government

decided  to enter into financial arrangements  with

the  Service  authorities, so that the  transaction

could  be  completed and the estate transferred  to

the    Singapore    Government.   Provision    has

accordingly  been  made  for  acquisition  of  this

property at a cost of $6,770,000. The total cost to

the  British Exchequer, if the transaction had been

completed,  would have been about $l5½  million.

Under the present arrangements,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



for  a  payment of $6,770,000 the transaction would

be  completed and the property would  vest  in  the

Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service families would be allowed to continue in

occupation of the premises till the end of 1971  at

the  latest. If the Member wants to know  what  use

could be made of these premises, there are a number

of  possible  uses. The estate is ideally  situated

and   can   house  many  visiting  foreign  experts

advising Government and statutory boards and  other

agencies  of Government. These foreign experts  are

at  present housed either in hotels or in  quarters

provided  by  Government and statutory boards,  and

they   are  housed  in  quarters  which  are  large

colonial type bungalows in areas which can be  more

intensively developed or better utilised. If we can

find no use for Chip Bee Estate, we can let it  out

quite easily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $11,770,000 for Head 91 ordered to

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 92 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item 001 of  subhead

201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a token vote of $10 has been

entered  in  this  item for the development  of  an

underground car park at the Padang. In view of  the

importance  of  this piece of land which  is  being

used  from  time to time for national  purposes,  I

wish  to seek information from the Minister  as  to

how  he  proposes  to develop the  Padang  into  an

underground car park.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Sir, only $10 has been provided and

it  is  a  token vote. Studies are being  made  and

further studies will have to be made with regard to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



proposed  car park. The object, if it is  feasible,

is  to construct a car park under the Padang.  Cars

will go in from both sides of the road so that  you

can   carry  on  with  your  National  Day  parade,

football games, hockey, cricket and tennis  on  the

Padang.  The Padang has become a part of Singapore.

It has been a part of Singapore for so long that  I

think  our planners would be mad if we did anything

else  with it; but I have been told that  they  can

build  a  car  park underneath the  Padang  without

affecting  the grass and we will have to  wait  and

see  whether or not their plans are feasible. Hence

the token vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> In view of the explanation, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 92 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 202.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 92 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sum of money is to be used for the East

Coast foreshore reclamation scheme. This scheme  is

a  very farsighted one, because Singapore is  short

of  land. That is why we have to extend our land by

reclaiming from the sea. I would like to pose a few

questions to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in respect of the present East Coast

foreshore  reclamation scheme, how  many  acres  of

land have been reclaimed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how long will it take before we can use

this reclaimed land?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what plans does the Government have and

what  buildings  will be built  on  this  reclaimed

land?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the earthworks for the

reclamation of about 1,000 acres of land from Bedok

to the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



Swimming  Club  under Phase One of the  East  Coast

reclamation  scheme was completed in  January  this

year. However, work on the drainage system has  yet

to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Phase Two, about another 125 acres will be

reclaimed from the Singapore Swimming Club  to  the

end  of Tanjong Rhu. About 30 of the 125 acres have

so  far been reclaimed. It is hoped to complete the

second  phase of the reclamation by the end of  the

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclaimed land is earmarked for housing,

tourist   projects,  commercial  shopping  centres,

light   industries   and  parks  for   recreational

purposes. It will have a five-mile long beach and a

marineland  complex which is being planned  by  the

Primary Production Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how long before the land can be used, we

will  have  to  wait. This really depends  on  what

particular use the land will be put to. As for  the

marineland complex, if we are ready we can go ahead

tomorrow.  If buildings are to be put on,  we  will

have to wait a little time for the earth to settle.

And  if  piling is needed, piling will have  to  be

done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   thank  the  Minister  for  his  detailed

explanation and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 92 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

302.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a provision for the reclamation of

land from the Singapore Swimming Club to the end of

Tanjong  Rhu. I would like to ask the Minister  two

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, how many acres of land will be reclaimed

under this reclamation scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are there any plans to build a road

stretching  from Tanjong Rhu to Clifford  Pier?  If

there are, when will the plans be implemented?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Under this scheme, 125 acres of land

from  the  Singapore Swimming Club to  the  end  of

Tanjong  Rhu  will be reclaimed. So far,  about  30

acres  of  land  have  been  reclaimed.  The  first

project that will be completed along the whole East

Coast reclamation is a road from Bedok right up  to

the  end  of  Tanjong Rhu. If we are to cross  from

Tanjong Rhu into town, we will either have to build

a  bridge  which will be too long, or reclaim  some

more  land, and that will be a possible third phase

and it will take a very long time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ch'ng Jit Koon -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 92 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

401.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon:</b> Sir, I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 92 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 403.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for subhead 403 is a big one. It

amounts  to $11 million. I would like to know  what

the  Government intends to do with this big sum  of

money.  What purposes will this money be used  for?

Why  should there be such a big vote? What are  the

uses   when  the  plans  are  completed?  Has   the

Government any plans to build houses or residential

estates or other types of buildings on this land?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the successful

completion of two urban redevelopment pilot schemes

-  Precinct North One and Precinct South  One  - the

additional section of the urban area which has been

divided  into  a number of precincts,  collectively

termed   as   "Other  Precincts",   will   now   be

implemented. Some of these areas have already  been

acquired   for  redevelopment,  and  even   private

developers  and  landowners will be  encouraged  to

redevelop  in accordance with guide plans  prepared

by the Urban Renewal Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any urban renewal scheme needs a lot of money.

If  the  Government acquires land, it has to  pay

for  it.  Land  in  the city is expensive.  After

having  paid  money for the land to  the  owners,

Government has also to compensate the occupiers - tenants,  sub-tenants, licensees,  and  sometimes

trespassers. All this takes a lot of time and, in

the final result, a lot of money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): From the

Minister's  explanation, does it  mean  that  our

urban renewal scheme will be unprofitable?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> We are not going into urban renewal

for profit, but neither can we afford to lose  on

it.  The object of urban renewal is to renew  the

town,  otherwise  we  will have  old  houses  and

dilapidated buildings - and eyesores.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our houses were built 50 or 60 years ago

for  those times. They are falling apart  now.  I

have  not  come  here to speak about  control  of

rent.  But  one major factor which has  prevented

development in this city is the fact that we have

the  Control  of Rent Ordinance, and  because  of

this, landlords cannot obtain possession of their

property  from  tenants. Hence  the  experimental

scheme   under  the  Control  of  Rent   (Special

Provisions)  Act.  We  have demarcated  about  80

acres   in   the   centre   of   the   city   for

redevelopment.  Without  that  amending  Act,  no

development can take place. And it would  be  for

the  Government to evict everybody and  sell  the

property. We do not lose money. In fact, we  make

money.  But the money we make is used to  provide

better  housing  for the poorer sections  of  the

population.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

satisfied with the Minister's explanation  and  I

beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I wish to raise under this amendment

is  purely  a question of technicality. According

to my view, this subhead, which involves a sum of

$1.8 million, should be more appropriately placed

under Head 1207 - National Development Division - in  the Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure  and

not  in  the  Development Estimates. If  this  is

done,  the  details  of  the  various  posts   of

officers  in  charge of administration  of  urban

renewal  schemes and the various items  of  Other

Charges  Annually Recurrent can be shown  in  the

Estimates and subject to scrutiny by this  House.

May  I  ask  the  Minister for Law  and  National

Development to give his comments to this House?

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member has made a good

point.  There is no special reason for this.  But

the  urban  renewal programme was  started  as  a

development   project.  We  are  discussing   the

Development Estimates and, therefore,  all  items

of  expenditure,  including Personal  Emoluments,

Other  Charges Annually Recurrent, together  with

other  items of development expenditure  such  as

Land  Acquisition and Resettlement,  were  lumped

together for budgetary convenience. That is  all.

But the Member has made a point that it should be

elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this provision of $25,500 is for the

Poultry Broiler Research Unit. Firstly, I wish  to

know  what  kind of research work this  Unit  will

carry  out.  Secondly, will it be useful  for  the

development   of  agriculture  in   our   country?

Thirdly,   will  the  farmers  benefit  from   the

research?  And, fourthly, how many  employees  are

there in this unit?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the Member

for  Jurong, the Member for Sembawang  has  always

asked  the Primary Production Department  to  help

farmers  more and more. This is one way  in  which

the Department is positively helping farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a pilot project of broiler production has

been carried out in the Sembawang Research Station

in Sembawang in the last two years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> No, it is in Nee Soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am sorry. Broiler production is

processed  to  rear large numbers of  poultry  for

poultry  meat. Poultry reared under this intensive

production system reaches marketing weight in nine

to  ten  weeks instead of the usual three to  four

months.  In other words, the chickens grow faster.

This pilot project



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



has   been  successful  and  the  information  and

techniques  gained have been disseminated  to  the

farmers.  Nowadays,  many  farmers  have   already

started,  to  produce  broilers  and  the  Poultry

Section  in  the  Sembawang  Research  Station  is

continuing  its  investigations  to  improve   the

techniques  and  to  solve any problems  that  may

arise. The unit is not very big and it consists of

a dozen or so employees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  does this unit provide free services to  the

farmers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The unit does not charge the

farmers.  It  teaches  them the  methods  and  the

techniques.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Free of charge?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> No fees are charged. But if a

farmer, after having learnt the techniques,  wants

his  chickens to grow faster, then he  must  spend

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since

this  is  a  project to help farmers, it  deserves

praise.  Therefore,  I beg leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

104*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I stand to be corrected, but I seem to

remember that during the debate on the Development

Estimates in December 1968, the Minister told  the

House  that  when the pig section of  the  Central

Abattoir  in  Jurong  was  ready,  he  would  give

consideration  to building a few rural  abattoirs.

But  I  have  been looking through the Development

Estimates and subhead 105, which is in respect  of

rural  abattoirs,  has been  taken  off.  Can  the

Minister  tell the House whether it has  now  been

decided not to go ahead with the building of rural

abattoirs? And, if so, why is this so?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the

same  sentiments as expressed by my colleague,  the

Member  for Jalan Kayu. In fact, a couple of  years

ago, I brought up this question of rural abattoirs.

There  was then a token provision of $10 in respect

of  several  rural  abattoirs  in  the  Development

Estimates. I feel that there is a need for the  construction  of  such abattoirs in centrally  located

rural  areas to help pork sellers get their  supply

of  meat  and  arrive at the markets in  the  rural

areas  as quickly as possible. Sir, I have  brought

up  this  point because I have received  complaints

that  the  Central Abattoir is too far  from  areas

like Jalan Kayu, Punggol or Upper Serangoon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Changi!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, Sir, Changi and also

Tampines.  We  have a sizable population  in  these

areas.  Under such circumstances, will the Minister

for  Law  and  National Development sympathetically

consider the building of rural abattoirs?  And,  if

not,  whether  he will look into the  prospects  of

awarding  tenders  for  the construction  of  rural

abattoirs   with   a   view  to   getting   private

organisations to run them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Punggol

practically  took  the  words  out  of  my   mouth!

Government's  thinking  on  the  need   for   rural

abattoirs   has   not  changed.  But   Government's

thinking  on  who  should run these  abattoirs  has

changed.  In view of our experience at  the  Jurong

Abattoir,  we  are  thinking  of  letting   private

enterprise run even the Jurong Abattoir - in  other

words, a statutory board or a public company and we

are  inviting the private sector to come in. We  do

not  want  just  the  civil  servants  to  run  the

abattoir if it is converted into a public company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as rural abattoirs are concerned, no

provision  is made this year for the simple  reason

that  Government,  by itself, does  not  intend  to

build  abattoirs in the rural areas. That does  not

mean  to  say  that we have abandoned the  idea  of

building abattoirs in the rural areas. But  as  the

Member for Punggol



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



has put it, we think that the abattoir could be run

better if it was built by private enterprise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

203.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving this amendment in order to

obtain  some information from the Minister. Can  he

inform the House what is this provision for? I  see

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



there  is a vote of $50,000 now as against a token

vote of $10 for last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

proposes  to carry out a pilot scheme  on  factory

farming,  that  is  to say,  to  rear  animals  in

confined  spaces and, if possible, in multi-storey

livestock  houses. The objective of the scheme  is

to   intensify  the  use  of  land  and   increase

production  per unit area in view of the  shortage

of  agricultural  land  in  Singapore.  Under  the

scheme,  it is proposed to rear poultry, pigs  and

goats  in  multi-storey livestock  houses  and  to

assess  the  technical  as well  as  the  economic

feasibilities of such a project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory farming pilot scheme is, therefore,

at  present only in its initial stages.  It  is  a

plan awaiting the approval of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I beg to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

206*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Hwang Soo Jin and Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister inform us how the Agricultural

Statistics Unit is carrying on its work?  In  what

way are the statistics on the farmers collected by

this unit used to assist the farmers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know

what  has accounted for the delay in carrying  out

the agricultural survey?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish

to  ask  one  question. I notice that  under  this

subhead,  a  "Farm Licensing, Agricultural  Survey

and  Agricultural Statistics Unit" will be set up.

Can  the Minister disclose to this House how  many

licences  have  been  issued  up  to  the   latest

convenient date? I welcome the proposal to set  up

this unit and I hope it will assist the farmers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



in  every possible manner, because I feel that the

agricultural  produce supplied by the  farmers  in

Singapore  has contributed in no small measure  to

our economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the data collected

under farm licensing will be used to ascertain the

existing state of agriculture in Singapore and  to

assess  future  potential  and  development,  thus

enabling  the  Government to plan for agricultural

policy  on  the  basis of the kind and  amount  of

services  needed by the farming community.  Unless

we  know how many and what type of farmers  there

are, we will not be able to know what sort or what

amount of help they would need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be possible that, with adequate

information available, even farmers may be advised

to  plan their production targets in relation  not

only  to  domestic needs but also  to  the  export

market  demand for agricultural produce. This  was

only  recently the subject of a question from  the

Member to me in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the agricultural survey, there has been

no delay. At the moment, we are ready to go on but

we  are  awaiting  approval from the  Ministry  of

Finance. In all, 20,357 farm licences were  issued

for  the  year  1969. A report on farm  licensing,

giving   various  details  based  on   information

provided by the farmers, has been prepared and, if

any Members are interested, I can easily send them

a copy of the report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I thank the Minister for his explanation  and

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

207.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year the Minister very kindly

explained to us what hydroponics involved. I

should appreciate it if the Minister would inform

us to what extent progress has been made in

experimenting with hydroponics. When can the

knowledge and experience gained by such experiments

be passed on to the private sector for commercial

exploitation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member has

pointed out, the hydroponics scheme is new to

Singapore. But the Member can see from the amount

of money which has been provided that more is

needed. Facilities for carrying out the projects

are being organised, equipment is being purchased,

and more staff is being recruited. Hence the bigger

vote.



I am not very optimistic that we can help the

farmers very soon, but it is estimated that within

two years, after results of certain findings are

made available for dissemination to the farming

community, and if the Department is satisfied that

the information released would enable the farmers

to operate hydroponics on a profitable commercial

basis, then hydroponics will have come to stay with

us. I am afraid that at the moment it is still very

much in the experimental stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 93 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just wish to seek further information on

the question of providing the necessary fishing

training facilities by the Fishing Training Centre.

How many courses have been conducted and how many

trainees have passed out to date? Has the Fishing

Training Centre encountered any difficulties in

recruiting the necessary trainees?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two training

courses  have so far been completed at the  Fishing

Training  Centre  at Changi. The first  course  was

from  August to October 1969, and the second course

was  from  December  last year to  February  this

year. A third course will be started in April  this

year, that is to say, next month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no difficulty in recruiting

students. There were 60 places for the two  courses

-  in  other words, 30 places for each course. More

than 400 youths applied for training. To date,  42

trainees  have  completed the course  successfully,

and 75 per cent of them have already found jobs on

fishing vessels. The rest are likely to be taken up

for  employment by fishing companies  in  the  near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports received show that the fishing companies

are satisfied with the work of the trainees.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these three-month courses to

which  I have referred, the Fishing Training Centre

conducted a one-week course in January for captains

of  small trawling vessels to give them some up-to-date knowledge of navigation and chart reading,  as

well  as  modern fishing methods and use of fishing

gear.  Forty-five persons applied for  the  course,

but  only 38 were taken. Thirty-five completed the

course and are now back on their jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has   mentioned  just  now  that  there  were   400

applicants  for  60 places. In view  of  the  large

number of applicants for such a training course, I

would  enquire of the Minister if he would consider

taking  in as many applicants as possible for  such

courses,  because at the moment we have  quite  a

large number of fishing trawlers.



Some  time  ago  the Minister for  Finance  made  a

remark  in  this  House that our youths  could  not

withstand the training at sea. Therefore,  in  view

of  the,  large, number of applications  for  these

courses, would the Minister not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



consider  opening  the door  wider  so  that  more

youths could come forward to play their part?  And

what future prospects do these trainees have in

this respect?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also feel that more publicity should be

given  to  this  matter as I strongly  support  the

setting up of such training facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, we would be happy to take more

on if we could take more on. But the facilities are

limited  - one training vessel - and hence  only  30

have been taken per course. The course is for three

months  only. But if that is the way we  carry  on,

all  the  400 who applied will have to wait  a  few

years  before they get in. I do not know the  exact

details, but I will look into the suggestion of the

Member to see whether more courses can be conducted

or  more  trainees will be allowed  to  attend  per

course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I must thank the Minister for

his  kind  consideration, and I do  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ng

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item concerns the Pan-Island Expressway,

and  I  have  only one question to  ask.  Will  the

Minister  consider developing a coastal road  round

the island?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the whole transport

system in Singapore is at present being studied  by

a  team of United Nations consultants and our local

counterparts   at  the  State  and  City   Planning

Department.  There is no plan for  a  coastal  road

right  round the island. All I can offer the Member

is  a  plan for a new coastal road linking the east

coast  to  the  city.  This is  the  only  positive

proposal under active consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 95 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 206.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one item of this vote is for Sembawang Road

Improvement  (10  m.s. to 13 m.s.).  I  think  this

stretch  of Sembawang Road includes a road  in  the

Nee  Soon area. Since this road improvement project

involves  two  constituencies, I think  the  Member

for Nee Soon, who is now here, would also like to

express his views on this project.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have several questions to ask and I would

like  the Minister to pay special attention to what

I  am  going to say. This project for extension  of

roads has affected 40-odd shops and private houses.

May I ask, when will this project start? The second

question  is:  how does the Government  propose  to

deal with the shops and dwelling houses affected by

this   project?   The  third  question   is:   what

compensation  is  the Government  prepared  to  pay

them, and in what form?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member can rest assured that I

pay  particular attention to his remarks. I  always

do!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sembawang Road to City System is divided into

two  sections:  (1) a proposed improvement  of  the

road  from  10  m.s  to 13 m.s. The  project  costs

about  $560,000.  (2) The proposed improvement  and

widening  of  Upper Thomson Road  -  from  Braddell

Circus  to  the  6½ m.s. Upper Thomson  Road.  The

project costs $800,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the increasing industrial expansion in

Sembawang,  proposals  are under  consideration  to

make  Sembawang Road into a major dual  carriageway

to  serve  the future development in that  area.  A

census is now being taken of the number of families

that  will be affected, and a preliminary  estimate

is that about 476 families may be affected, of whom

about 100 are shopkeepers. How do we resettle  them

and where will we resettle them? How? With the help

of the Member for Sembawang. Where? We are building

a  housing estate complex along Thomson Road  where

we  hope to rehouse persons occupying houses  along

the  road, whether residents or shopkeepers. At the

moment,  the housing complex is not ready.  Perhaps

in  two years' time, when the complex is ready,  we

may  be  able  to house all, if not  most,  of  the

Member's  evicted  constituents  in  this   housing

complex. When the time comes, I will need the  help

of the Member for Sembawang.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, of course,

if the Minister's request is reasonable, I will

lend my full support. But I would like to raise two

further questions. The Minister seems to have

omitted answering my question: when will this

project start? The Minister has also mentioned the

housing complex at Thomson Road, and I think the

Member for Thomson will be interested in this. My

second question is: when will the resettlement of

the affected residents and shopkeepers take place?

Will it be before or after the completion of this

housing complex at Thomson Road?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am sorry for not answering all the

Member's questions. He asked so many questions that

I am afraid I forgot to answer some of them.



The  Member  can  rest assured  that  most  of  the

occupants  will  not  have to move  until  we  have

alternative accommodation for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complex I referred to is a complex which is

to be built on a piece of land near the Home of the

Little Sisters of the Poor. Work has begun and most

of  the complex should be ready by the end of  this

year; but this is an estimate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

satisfied  with the answers given, but I hope  that

the staff concerned with this project will also pay

attention to the answers given by the Minister.  I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 95 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ch'ng Jit Koon -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 95 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

306.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 95 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 310.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, Sir, I am referring to

item  007  -  not  James Bond, of course  -  which

concerns  Bus  Bays, Shelters, Vehicle  Parks  and

Roadside  Kerbs.  This item  has  a  provision  of

$300,000.  I would be grateful to the Minister  if

he   could  inform  this  House  whether  any  bus

shelters  will be put up along Punggol  Road  this

year.  I have made representations on this before,

and  was told no funds were available and that  I

was to be patient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, the programme for 1970-71 for the construction of bus shelters is now

under  study.  The need for more bus  shelters  in

Punggol will be investigated in consultation  with

the  Registrar of Vehicles, the Omnibus  Services

Licensing Authority, and the P.W.D. At the moment,

I cannot promise the Member more bus shelters. All

I  can  say  is that any application from  Punggol

will be given every consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In view of the Minister's reply,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 95 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 96 be

reduced by $ 100*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, $2.3 million of the nearly $4.2

million provision under this head will be required

for  the  Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation, Phase  I,

project.   Under  this  head,  it  is  very   much

regretted  that no provision whatsoever  has  been

made  for Changi Constituency. As the Minister  is

aware, Changi is a flood-affected area, especially

the  Koh Sek Lim area. I think there is unfairness

in the allocation of funds under this head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many rich people live in the Bukit

Timah  and  Ulu Pandan areas. I also know  that  a

number  of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries

live  in  these  areas too.  We  are  a  socialist

government  and surely, whilst looking  after  the

rich  people, we should also look after  the  poor

country folk and the farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the

sentiments expressed by the Member for Changi.  At

the  same  time, I wonder whether the Minister  is

aware  that  the  drainage and  flood  alleviation

system  in  certain areas in Punggol needs  to  be

attended to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I bring up a somewhat new subject under this

topic "Drainage and Flood Alleviation". Whilst the

Government is taking steps to introduce schemes to

alleviate floods, etc., the private developer also

presents this problem. I have noticed two projects

in  my  constituency, at about the 6¾ milestone

opposite Upper Serangoon Road. They have their own

drainage  systems in the private housing  estates.

Very  often the drains are constructed in  such  a

way  that, instead of the outlets facing the  main

road,   they  face  inwards,  towards  low   land.

Consequently, all waste and water just simply  run

on  to somebody else's land, and, worse still, the

residences in the neighbouring lands are affected.

I hope the Minister will look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



into  this  problem of drainage and see what  steps

the  private developers have to take to ensure that

the water in the estate does not drain into someone

else's land, This will prevent houses in the  lower

area from being subject to flood hazards.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Firstly, may I correct a

misapprehension which the Member for Changi appears

to  be  under  when he refers to  the  Bukit  Timah

scheme  on  which  we  are  spending  a  total   of

$2,330,700 for the first phase, the misapprehension

being  that  the richer people live in Bukit  Timah

and  under that heading he includes a few Ministers

who  are  not rich. But there are many kampongs  in

Bukit Timah, and when the Bukit Timah canal floods,

the rich people are all right because they have two

houses  - one in Tanglin and the other in Changi  - and  they move to Changi. But it is the poor people

who  are  affected and it is these people  that  we

have  to  rescue.  Hence,  this  big  canal  scheme

diverting waters of the upper Bukit Timah Canal  to

Ulu  Pandan.  As I have said before in this  House,

work is in progress and it is anticipated that this

scheme  will be completed by the end of this  year.

It  will not eliminate flooding in Bukit Timah, but

it will alleviate flooding along Bukit Timah. There

is  no  provision for Changi, and unless my experts

are  wrong, there is no need to provide for Changi.

Changi had a bad flood on the 10th December,  1969,

but  that  was because a bund built as  part  of  a

drainage  system  to hold water  broke  and,  as  a

result,  the  water flowed down  a  valley  causing

floods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Punggol, no provision has also been made

because flooding in Punggol is really very  minor.

There  is nothing serious - occasional minor floods

in  certain  lands at the 8th m.s., Punggol  Road,

owing to the very low-lying nature of the land. You

have the Serangoon River and the swamps around  it.

Occasionally flooding in such low-lying areas is,  I

am afraid unavoidable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to complaints against private developers, any

private  developer  who  constructs  or  builds   a

housing estate must have his plans approved by  the

Chief   Building   Surveyor.  Many   Members   have

complained  of delays in the plans. One reason  why

it takes a little time is that the plans have to go

to various departments - the Ministry of Health, the

Fire Brigade and, in the context of what the Member

for  Punggol seeks, the Drainage Department of  the

Public  Works  Department. So any,  developer  must

have  had  his plans approved, including plans  for

his drainage. So if water flows into someone else's

land, the appropriate remedy is a complaint to  the

Drainage Department of the P.W.D. Alternatively, an

action at law in our courts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. The

drainage  problem  in one of the two  places  where

these  new  housing  estates  are  coming  up   was

attended  to  by  the Drainage  Department  of  the

Public  Works Department quite some time  ago.  The

point  I  am  trying to drive home is  whether  the

Drainage  Department of the Public Works Department

studies  the  drainage  problem  pertaining  to   a

proposed  housing project. Will they  not  consider

this  aspect  that  drains in  the  housing  estate

should  not divert into someone else's land?  When

complaints  come  up, the private  developers  just

keep the matter in abeyance. Meanwhile, they go  on

building  houses,  and  who  suffers?  It  is   the

residents.  In  other words,  it  is  the  Drainage

Department of the P.W.D. that has to make sure that

the developers do not allow the drainage outlet  to

go into someone else's lands which are low-lying.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If the Member is speaking of the

development of the Hai Sing estate, as  the  Member

himself  has put it, the matter has been  settled.

If  I  have to repeat myself, water flows downhill

and not uphill. Sometimes with the permission of

adjoining landowners, drains are built But  where

a  housing estate is built and, as a result of  the

bad drainage system, the water



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



flows into and floods someone else's land, he has a

good  cause of action in law. If he cannot  obtain

sufficient satisfaction from the drainage  engineer

of   the  Public  Works  Department  or  from  the

developer,  my advice to him would be to  bring  an

action  in  court  for damages,  for  trespass  and

nuisance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I was not very expressive in

explaining  to  the Minister, but my  question  was

whether  this drainage outlet should be allowed  to

divert  into  someone else's land by  the  Drainage

Department  of  the P.W.D. My point was  that  this

should  not be allowed, and therefore the  drainage

outlet  should  be diverted outwards,  even  though

there  are  low-lying areas. Certainly  you  should

have  a system whereby you allow a drop of so  many

inches  per length of, say, a hundred feet  outward

onto the main road. Further, we have a scheme along

Tampines  Canal. That area of Punggol  which  I  am

discussing  is rather low-lying, and  all  drainage

outlets  that  are  directed  to  that  area   will

definitely flood it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I

cannot help the Member further, unless I visit  the

place  with him. But there are big drains,  monsoon

drains,  into which water from houses  flow.  There

are  plenty of these drains in Tanglin.  I  do  not

know the details of the cause of the complaint, and

I  think  it  would be pointless carrying  on  this

debate  here. The only thing for me to do would  be

to  visit the place with the Member and see whether

he  or the Public Works Department or the developer

is right.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  know whether the Minister agrees that the  poor

people  in  Bukit Timah should be looked  after.  I

also  hope  that the villagers in Changi  are  also

looked after. Therefore. I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a provision of $1 million for the

Serangoon sewerage scheme. What I am going to bring

up  is  nothing  new, because it is stated  in  the

Memorandum  on the Development Estimates  that  the

project  will  have  a  capacity  to  serve  77,000

persons.  I shall be grateful if the Minister  will

enlighten  this House on which particular  area  in

Serangoon will benefit by this project?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Sir, the area approved for provision

of  sewerage  facilities in the Serangoon  sewerage

scheme  is  approximately 1,300  acres  bounded  by

Upper  Serangoon Road, Yio Chu Kang Road,  Braddell

Road,  Sungei Kallang and Serangoon Gardens Estate,

which  means  that  Punggol is  out.  There  is  no

immediate plan to serve the Punggol area because of

its  low  density of population. But  I  have  said

before  in  this  House  that  the  object  of  the

Government in the long-term is to provide  sewerage

facilities  throughout the  island  as  far  as  is

possible.  The  day will come when  we  will  reach

Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Minister has taken the

question  out of my mouth. He mentions  an  area  of

1,300  acres bounded by certain roads. In  fact,  I

notice  that there are many septic tanks in  a  few

places  within the area mentioned by the  Minister.

In  other  words,  there is  already  provision  of

modern  sanitation. With the extension of  sewerage

facilities  to Serangoon, can it not be extended  to  Upper Serangoon? The Minister says that Punggol

will  have  sewerage facilities later on.  But  the

area  mentioned by the Minister is a congested area

and  quite a number of housing estates are  coming

up there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



There are septic tanks in this area. Are we doing

away with septic tanks and having the houses

connected direct to main sewers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> No, we are not getting rid of septic

tanks. Obviously, the Member for Punggol cannot

take "No" for an answer. But I cannot say "Yes" if

the P.W.D. is not as yet ready to move into

Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I can always take "No" for

an answer and can assure the Minister that the

answers given by him are satisfactory. I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $12,061,480 for Head 97 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 98 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 98 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item 001 of subhead

101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1966, about 82 miles of agricultural

and  kampong roads have been constructed.  I  note

that only $400,000 is allocated for the financial

year  1970-71.  Members who  represent  the  rural

constituencies will agree with me that this amount

is   inadequate,  especially  when   kampong   and

agricultural roads which were built two  or  three

years ago are now in a very deplorable condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  National  Development  (National  Development

Division),  who is the Chairman of the  Urban  and

Rural  Services  Committee, has gone  round  Pulau

Tekong Besar with me, and he agrees that the roads

there  are  in  a deplorable state. Sir,  $400,000

will  not  be enough to build even one-quarter  of

the  roads.  Therefore, I hope the  Minister  will

consider   asking  the  Ministry  of  Finance   to

allocate more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



money  for  the  construction,  improvement   and

maintenance  of agricultural roads  in  the  rural

constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I quite agree that the amount of $400,000 provided

for  the  financial year 1970-71 for the  construction,  improvement and maintenance of agricultural

and  kampong  roads is not enough. But  from  past

experience, the Urban and Rural Services Committee

has  decided  that when a kampong road  is  to  be

repaired  and it costs a lot of money  to  do  it,

then  it  should be done in two or  three  stages.

This  has been the practice in the past few years.

In  the  financial year 1970-71,  if  the  amount

provided  for  the construction,  improvement  and

maintenance of kampong roads is not enough,  there

are  many  items  under  this  subhead  which  are

transferable.  For instance, if the provision  for

extension  of  electricity  supply  has  not  been

spent, we can transfer this amount and use it  for

the repair of kampong roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I hope my suggestion will

be  seriously  looked into. And  in  view  of  the

Parliamentary Secretary's explanation, I beg leave

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 98 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item 011 of  subhead

101*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the removal of public stand-pipes in

the rural constituencies, I hope that the Ministry

concerned  can  give immediate approval  for  the

laying  of  water mains so that the people  living

there  can have their own supply of water. When  a

project  for the laying of water mains costs  over

$30,000, it is the usual practice of the Urban and

Rural Services Committee to defer it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



And  their excuse is that there are not many houses

in  that  particular area to justify the laying  of

water mains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to state one case in Kampong Darat

Nanas   in  Jalan  Bena  in  my  constituency.   My

Citizens'  Consultative  Committee  and  I  made  a

request  five years ago for the extension of  water

supply to this place. But to date, the request  has

still  been  deferred. We agree that public  stand-pipes should be removed and the people should  know

that  water  means life. But if we  are  to  remove

something  from the people, we have  to  substitute

another thing in place thereof. Therefore, it is  a

matter  of  how we should implement the  policy.  I

hope  the Ministry concerned can give consideration

to my suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  fully  support what the Member  for  Changi  has

said,  because a supply of water is very  essential

to  the  people in the rural areas. The Member  has

said  that  if there are few dwelling houses  in  a

remote  rural  area,  then  the  Urban  and   Rural

Services Committee does not consider it worth while

to lay water mains in that area. In the Development

Estimates,  there is a provision of $1 million  for

the   extension  of  water  supply.  I   hope   the

Parliamentary Secretary will consider extending the

supply of water to remote rural areas.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  Member  for Changi, I wish to say that  it  is

true  that  two  requests for the laying  of  water

mains  have been made and that the matter has  been

deferred for quite some time. However, I can assure

him  that we have been provided with more money for

the  supply  of water mains this year. His  request

will therefore be given due consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I explained yesterday the procedure

regarding the removal of stand-pipes. Perhaps I can

explain  further  how the position  stands  at  the

moment.  On  31st December, 1966, there were  2,471

stand-pipes. By 31st December,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



1969,  there  were  only 1,088  stand-pipes  left.

Therefore, within a period of three years  we  have

removed  1,383 stand-pipes. From this figure,  Sir,

it  can clearly be seen that we have spent quite  a

lot  of money on the laying of water mains in order

that  the  rural people can connect water mains  to

individual households. Since we have been  provided

with  more money for the supply of water  mains  in

this  year's estimates, more and more of them  will

be laid, especially in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I just do not

understand the Parliamentary Secretary when he said

just  now that by cutting down the number of public

stand-pipes,  a  greater amount of money  has  been

spent. What is the logic behind this statement? Can

he clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon :</b> To give an example, Sir, I

have  a  list of requests for the laying  of  water

mains  in  the  rural and urban, or suburban  areas

which have not been approved by the Urban and Rural

Services Committee. For instance, there was a stand-pipe  at  Jalan  Darat Nanas in Changi.  After  its

removal,  we have to lay a water main  there  at  a

cost of $12,000. This is a bigger main than the one

available   to  supply  water  to  the   individual

households  in  that  area.  The  water  main   for

ordinary   stand-pipes  is  only  two   inches   in

diameter.  We  have to change it  to  four  or  six

inches  in diameter water mains in order to  supply

more water to the individual households.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you understand now, Mr Sim?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I still do not understand the

way  it is answered. I stand to be corrected,  Sir,

but  is it correct to say that by cutting down  the

number  of  public stand-pipes and  putting  bigger

water mains in, a lot of money is spent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I think you have got it right!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, this is not the point

which I raised. When you take something from the

people, you must substitute another thing in its

place.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is what the Parliamentary

Secretary  has said, Mr Sim. He says that  more

water  mains have been laid so that more  houses

will now get water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

very   happy   with  the  answer.   I   am   not

withdrawing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 98 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a provision of $2.3

million  against  the  title  "Urban  and  Rural

Services".  I would like to ask a few questions.

It  seems  that  there is  a  reduction  in  the

provision for the rural areas. If we compare the

provision made for Sembawang Constituency a  few

years ago and the sum allotted now, we see  that

there is a reduction of about 80 per cent in the

provision.  I believe this is true for  all  the

rural  areas, for example, Changi, Nee Soon  and

Thomson  Constituencies.  We  must  provide   an

adequate amount of money for facilities  in  the

rural   areas.  Amenities  of  many  kinds   are

provided  in  the city area and  we  should  not

spend  too  much money there. I would  like  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to make more  provision

for the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under item 011 there is a provision of $1

million for the extension of water supply.  Many

stand-pipes have been removed by the Government.

However,  before they were removed, water  mains

should  have  been laid so that the installation

of waterpipes to the individual households would

be facilitated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a

point  of order. I have already replied  to  the

question on water mains.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Have you finished, Mr Teong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Not yet,

Sir, I  have  another  question.  Although  the

Parliamentary  Secretary may have  answered  the

question raised by other Members, I am concerned

with  Sembawang Constituency. It is a  different

proposition. There is a road called Jalan  Pasar

Sembawang.  About 100 families live  along  this

road.  The people here used to have stand-pipes,

but  these  have now been removed. We have  made

representations to the U.R.S.C. but approval has

not   been  given  for  their  replacement.  The

residents  have  complained to me  about  it.  I

would  like the Parliamentary Secretary  to  pay

special  attention to their request and that  it

will be approved by the U.R.S.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting :</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon :</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member for Sembawang has said that the provision

allocated to the rural constituencies  has  been

reduced.  In  the  past, before  the  number  of

constituencies  was increased, there  were  only

the  following  constituencies:  Bukit  Panjang,

Bukit  Timah, Changi, Choa Chu Kang, Jalan Kayu,

Jurong,   Nee   Soon,  Punggol,  Sembawang   and

Tampines.    But    after   changes    in    the

constituencies were made, Kampong Chai Chee also

joined  their  ranks.  The  allocation  for  the

constituencies  is made on this  basis:  10  per

cent  for  32 urban constituencies, 35 per  cent

for  15 suburban constituencies and 55 per  cent

for 11 rural constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> It is not enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> If the Member concerned

says  that it is not enough, the right thing  to

do is to complain to the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Come on, do not pass the buck!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, on this basis of

allocation,   only   10  per   cent   is   for   32

constituencies. It is true that quite a  large  sum

of  money was not spent during past years. However,

beginning  from this financial year, we are  trying

to  divert  this money into beautifying  the  urban

areas and also the rural areas if applications  are

submitted for this purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> We are not interested!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Regarding the laying of water

mains in Sembawang Constituency, as mentioned by

the Member just now, the matter may still be in the

hands of the Public Utilities Board. I have not

received the application yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not

quite satisfied with the answer given by the

Parliamentary Secretary. I would like to give an

example and I wish him to explain the position.

Three years ago the vote for Sembawang Constituency

was about $100,000. Last year the vote was only

$18,000. This is a reduction of 80 per cent. I

would like the Parliamentary Secretary to make a

calculation himself and see how much reduction in

the provision has been made.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member will notice that the 12

months' provision for 1970-71 adds up to more than

the 15 months' provision for 1969-70. On that

issue, will the Member withdraw his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Institute of

Medical Specialities has passed through Phase I and

that  the  Centre  is  now in operation.  But  then

Parliament is being asked to provide for  Phase  II

of  the  project  which costs  slightly  more  than

$200,000.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be grateful if the Minister for

Health  could elaborate on the type of  specialized

units  that we are going to set up in Phase  II  of

the  Institute of Medical Specialities. Sir,  I  am

told  that some specialists are fighting  over  the

question of priority of specialization. If this  is

true, can the Minister say whether his Ministry has

encountered  any  difficulties in setting  up  this

Institute?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, as the Member for Punggol has said, Phase I of

the  Institute  of  Medical Specialities  has  been

completed, and it was officially opened  by  me  on

23rd  February,  1970.  That  is  the  Radiotherapy

Isotope Centre consisting of two cobalt units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked me about Phase II of the

Institute of Medical Specialities. May I  say  that

Phase  II consists of the main building which  will

house other specialities. Building plans have  been

drawn  up  and estimates, of course, made. Planning

approval,  however, is still awaited, and  this  is

not expected to be given until the concept and cost

of the Institute is reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member might have heard that I have appointed

a  Ministerial Committee on Medical Specialization,

which  will  be making its recommendations  on  the

priorities  of the specialities to be  established.

Before this Committee makes its recommendations,  I

would  not  like  to  say in this  House  what  the

specialities  are that will be established,  as  it

will  only prejudice the work of this Committee  on

Medical Specialities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also did say that he had heard that

there are difficulties because the specialists  are

fighting  among  themselves over  the  question  of

which speciality should be developed first. I would

like  to  put it this way. It is only natural  that

every  specialist would like his speciality  to  be

developed first. That is one of the reasons  why  I

have    appointed   this   Committee   on   Medical

Specialization. It will make recommendations to  me

on  the order of priority of the specialities to be

developed in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, it will interest the Member for

Punggol if I say something about this Committee  on

Medical  Specialization. May I  refer  him  to  its

terms of reference? Its first term of reference  is

to investigate the extent of development of medical

specialization   in   the  hospitals   and,   after

consideration of such development, to  recommend  a

programme of development or the creation of  a  few

specialities, listing them in order of priority for

selection. The basis of selection is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the specialities should meet the needs

of Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that they can be developed to achieve

eminence,  so that Singapore will be  recognised

regionally  and internationally as a  centre  of

treatment, training and research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's second term of reference is to

estimate  the  cost of development or  creation  of

some   specialities  and  the  personnel  required.

First,  let  me  explain that  the  development  of

medical  specialization in Singapore  is  a  costly

business.  Funds will not only be  needed  for  the

training and employment of the necessary staff, but

also   for   the   acquiring  of  more   up-to-date

equipment.  The  maintenance  of  this  modern  and

sophisticated  equipment is just as costly.  It  is

therefore  obvious, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  it  is

beyond  the  resources  of  a  small  country  like

Singapore to develop the entire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



range  of specialities. The Committee has therefore

been  asked, in its terms of reference which I have

mentioned  just now, to select a few  specialities,

listing  them  in  order of  priority  for  all-out

development. As its terms of reference specify, the

Committee in making the selection must bear in mind

two  factors:  (1)  that  development  of  such   a

speciality  will meet the needs of Singapore;  (2)

taking   into   consideration  our   existing   and

projected resources both of staff and finance,  and

whether  or not the development of the specialities

recommended  can  reasonably  achieve  a  level  of

eminence   so  that  Singapore  can  be  recognised

regionally  and  internationally  as  a  centre  of

treatment,  training and research. In other  words,

with such development, Singapore will be recognised

as  one  of  the  world's centres of excellence  in

medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say here, Sir, that the task of the

Committee is certainly not an easy one. It  has  to

make  a  difficult choice in listing the priorities

from  among  the competing claims for  support  for

future development among the many specialities.  It

will  have  to  exercise  impartial  and  objective

judgment in making its choice, bearing in mind  the

terms of reference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has perhaps seen the membership of the

Committee. But what I would like to say is that the

members  of the Committee have been very  carefully

selected,  so  that those who are on the  Committee

will  not have a vested interest in development  of

any particular speciality. Moreover, the membership

also  brings  with it a wide range of expertise  of

various backgrounds, talents and interests. Besides

medical   men,   they  also  include   businessmen,

administrators and economists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I say that this Committee has so far

made   good  progress,  having  received   numerous

memoranda  from our heads of units and  members  of

the  medical profession. Sir, here I would like  to

refer  to the Budget statement made by the Minister

for Finance on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



9th March, 1970, and I quote from Hansard, Vol. 29,

col. 496, first paragraph, last sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A committee is investigating and identifying

those  areas  of  medical specialisation  in  which

Singapore  could achieve pre-eminence by  providing

available  medical  expertise with  the  latest  in

equipment and facilities.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement of the Minister for Finance, Sir, is

indeed  most  encouraging.  For  the  doctors   and

specialists in my Ministry, this statement  clearly

indicates that funds will be forthcoming  from  the

Treasury, when the recommendations of the Committee

are adopted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, this is indeed a very

encouraging reply, and I must admit that I have  no

knowledge  of what the composition of the Committee

is  like.  In any case, I must say I am very  happy

with the detailed reply given by the Minister,  and

I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 605.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns "Refuse Treatment and

Disposal Plants", and there is a token provision of

$10  as against nil for last year. I wish to  bring

to  the notice of the Minister for Health that  the

Tampines  dumping  ground is a very  unsatisfactory

place.  No  doubt  it has been the  refuse  dumping

ground  for several years. I wonder what steps  the

Minister will take, with only a token provision  of

$10,  in  regard to refuse treatment  and  disposal

plants.  I  assume  his Ministry is  exploring  the

possibility of buying some disposal plants, so that

the  disposal of trade refuse and other rubbish can

be  done  in  a  much more hygienic  way  than  the

present  measures  taken at  the  Tampines  dumping

ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring this matter up because I have received

many  complaints  from  my  constituents  that  all

manner  of  rubbish  is being  dumped  there.  This

causes  a  stench in certain areas in Punggol,  and

during the recent drought there were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



some  outbreaks  of fire. In this respect,  Sir,  I

would be grateful if the Minister could indicate to

this House what his plans are for the treatment  of

refuse and disposal plants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I fully sympathise with

the  Member for Punggol because the biggest dumping

ground   in   Singapore   is   situated   in    his

constituency. Sir, in the nature of human activity,

there is always garbage to be disposed. That cannot

be  helped, and therefore a method must be  evolved

by  the  community to dispose of  its  garbage.  To

quote  one good example of the presence of  garbage

whenever  there is human activity.  Last  year  man

first landed on the moon and, as you know, when the

astronauts  left  the  moon  they  also  left  some

garbage behind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that the site of the

refuse    dumping    ground    at    Tampines    is

unsatisfactory, especially because of its  nuisance

potential.  The method of refuse disposal  at  that

site by dumping refuse directly into the swamp  not

only  causes  water  pollution  but  also  a  smell

nuisance  due to the decomposition of  the  refuse.

Hence  the complaints from his constituents.  Flies

and   other   vermin  breed  in  the   refuse   and

insecticides  have  to  be  used  to  control  such

breeding.  From  the  big mass of  rotting  refuse,

various  gases  of decomposition evolve,  including

methane gas which is highly inflammable when  mixed

with  air.  As a result of such mixture of  methane

gas  and  air you get instantaneous combustion  and

fires consequently break out. That, I think, is the

reason  for  the  fires in the dumping  ground,  as

complained by the Member for Punggol.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are newer methods of refuse disposal, and

my  Ministry  at  the  moment  is  considering  the

following ways of handling the 1,200 tons  per  day

of  refuse currently produced in Singapore.  First,

to acquire an incinerator to dispose of 900 tons of

refuse  per day, and ancillary equipment to utilise

the waste heat to produce high



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



pressure  steam  for generating  electricity,  thus

providing some economic return from the burning  of

refuse.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method is to build two refuse

compaction plants to handle the remaining 300  tons

of  refuse  per day by compressing the refuse  into

high-density bales measuring about one  cubic  yard

each,  which  could  be used for  reclaiming  swamp

land.  The  ground thus reclaimed can be  developed

for  use by light-weight structures. In order  that

there will be an alternative refuse disposal method

available  should any of the aforementioned  plants

break down, we have also to provide a disposal area

for  the ash and clinker from the incinerator,  and

an   adequately  equipped  refuse  dumping   ground

properly operated on the sanitary land-fill  method

will   also  have  to  be  maintained.  This  will,

however,  be a very small one. I do not know  where

it  will be - perhaps Punggol or somewhere else. As

I  have said, it will be a small one and it will be

more   hygienically  operated.  I  hope  that  will

satisfy the Member for Punggol.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am indeed satisfied with the

Minister's reply and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

703.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to seek

clarification on the development of and improvement

to  markets  and hawkers' sites. Will the  Minister

for   Health   indicate  the   sites   where   such

development of and improvement to markets will take

place?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  yesterday I asked the Minister two  questions

on  the vote for hawkers, but the Minister did  not

reply to one of my questions because of the lack of

time. Therefore, I feel that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



since  the  question  I raised yesterday  has  some

relationship  to  this vote, i.e., "Development  of

and Improvement to Markets and Hawkers' Sites" --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If questions during the last few

days  were  not  answered because  of  "guillotine"

time,  and  Members want them answered  today,  the

debate on this vote will never end.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what I want to ask is quite relevant  to  the

item here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have another few more minutes.

If you like, you can carry on but the Minister will

not be able to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what  I  want  to  say is  that  the  Hawkers

Department  and  the Housing and Development  Board

have been discussing the question of taking over of

hawkers'  sites.  I  hope they have  come  to  some

agreement on the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

that  I  did  not want to reply to the  Member  for

Tiong Bahru yesterday, but I was "guillotined". May

I  say  that  the  Member has brought  up  a  quite

relevant    question.   The   matter    is    under

consideration between my Ministry and  the  Housing

and Development Board. We are quite willing to hand

over  the  markets in the Housing  and  Development

Board estates to the Housing and Development Board,

but  there  are  certain snags.  For  example,  the

Ministry  of  Finance will want the markets  to  be

sold  to  the  Housing  and Development  Board.  Of

course, it simply means transferring money from one

pocket  to  another, but certain arrangements  will

have  to  be  made between the Government  and  the

Housing and Development Board before the control of

these markets can be taken over by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol wants to know about the

plans   for  resiting,  and  development   of   and

improvement to hawkers' sites, for which a  sum  of

$150,000 has been provided under this subhead  703.

Of this sum, $50,000 is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



a  revote  in respect of projects planned  but  not

implemented  last year, owing to funds  being  made

available late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the resiting of hawkers. Part of the

revote will be used for resiting of hawkers planned

last year in respect of the following areas:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Cluny Road;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Yew Tee Village, that is the side-lanes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clemenceau Village-Bukit Timah Road;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Onraet Road; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Jalan Mat Jambol, off Pasir Panjang Road.



<br><br>In  addition  to this, a sum from this year's  vote

will  be  used  for the resiting of hawkers  in  12

constituencies. These constituencies will be chosen

on  the basis of the urgency with which the hawkers

there   need   to  be  resited,  i.e.,   how   much

obstruction  they  are  causing,  and  under   what

sanitary  conditions they are currently  operating,

etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the development of hawkers' sites, I

wish  to  say  that  new  hawkers'  sites  will  be

developed,  if  necessary.  As  I  have   mentioned

earlier,   if   land  is  available   in   the   12

constituencies,   the  funds  allocated   for   the

resiting of hawkers will be used for that purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the improvement of hawkers' sites, the

funds remaining in the revote will be used for  the

improvement of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Geylang Serai Market; that is, (1) covering

of pitches; and (2) improvement to lighting;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Seng Poh Market; that is, improvement of bin

compartments; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Taman Jurong Market; that is, washing

platforms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds provided in this year's vote will also

be utilised to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) cover pitches at



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Bukit Ho Swee - four.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Queenstown - three.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Queenstown - four.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) carry out improvements to markets as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Upper Serangoon Market. Provision of

stalls for pork and fish licences and

chain link fence and gates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Jalan Eunos Market. Paving of open areas

for licensed pitches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Cambridge Road Market. Repairing poultry

slaughtering yards and bin compartments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Jalan Kayu Market. Repairs to office and

stalls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Bukit Panjang Market. Repairs to office and

poultry slaughtering yards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the summary of development

costs under this subhead for 1970-71 is estimated

to be:



<pre>

         (a) Revote                   50.000

         (b) Resiting of hawkers     120,000

         (c) Covering of pitches      42,350

         (d) Improvement to markets   36,150

                                    --------

                       Total:       $248,500

                                    ========

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Punggol will have noted, the

funds allocated for this subhead will be $98,500

short  of  what  was  requested.  Several  of   the

improvements  that  I have earlier  enumerated  may

have to be shelved.



<br><br>7.54 p.m.
