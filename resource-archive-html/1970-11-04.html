<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE ARMED FORCES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>VEHICLES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Particulars of traffic accidents and payment of compensation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister of

Defence  (a)  the  number  of  accidents  involving

vehicles  of the Singapore Armed Forces during  the

period 1st October, 1969, to 30th September,  1970; (b) how many of those accidents resulted in (i)

loss of life; and (ii) serious injury; and (c)  how

much  compensation for loss of life or  injury  has

been  paid  between  1st January,  1969,  and  30th

September, 1970, as a result of accidents involving

such vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of traffic offences

of  every  description  involving  Singapore  Armed

Forces  vehicles  during the  period  1st  October,

1969, to 30th September, 1970, is exactly 1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these 1,000 cases, seven resulted in loss of

life  and  in  18 other cases injuries  were  of  a

serious nature to warrant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



hospitalisation. Of the seven fatal accident cases,

one  involved a member of the S.A.F, and the others

were  all  civilians. The six cases  involving  the

civilians are still pending.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation paid out for loss of life, injuries

and  damage to vehicles for the period in  question

amounts to $68,683.94 cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the accident rate is deplorably high, about three times that of British Army vehicles in Singapore. There are many reasons for the poor performance of S.A.F, drivers. Among them are lack of experience, inadequate training and low levels of discipline in some instances. There is

clear  evidence from Unit records of  mileages  and

accidents  that  combat units  have  a  much  lower

accident  rate than P.D.F., Logistics  and  Service

Units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these reasons stem from one basic cause, and

that  is  the inordinately rapid expansion  of  the

Armed  Forces  which we had to bring about  in  the

last  two  years. This had resulted  in  a  greatly

increased demand for transport. It was difficult to

meet  this  demand and, at the same time,  maintain

high standards of driving. The problem is a serious

one  and  I am paying personal attention to  it.  I

discussed  the subject at a meeting with  all  Unit

Commanders held on 17th of September this  year.  A

number  of measures have been introduced to improve

driving discipline, to raise training standards and

to reduce pressure of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the difficulty here is that punishment

for  offences  committed by  military  drivers  has

hitherto  been  dealt with in the civilian  courts.

Cases  are  heard after a long interval  and  quite

often  the  penalty imposed by our  magistrates  is

very  light. For instance, an offence committed  in

December last year was dealt with last week and the

driver was fined $45.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the agreement of the civil authorities, it

is  now proposed to deal with these offences  under

military   discipline.  Henceforth,  all   military

drivers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



involved  in  accidents will be placed  immediately

under  open arrest, unless it is self-evident  from

the  nature  of the accident that the  drivers  are

blameless.  The military and civilian  police  have

agreed  to  co-operate to make  evidence  available

with  minimum delay. Drivers will be tried  not  by

Company Commanders but by Unit Commanders who  have

wider  powers  of punishment. A standard  scale  of

punishment is being worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the increased demand for drivers, the

period  of  training had to be reduced  from  eight

weeks  to  six  weeks.  I have  directed  that  the

training period revert to eight weeks. Further, the

number  of trainees will be determined not  by  the

demand  for transport by units in the Army  but  by

the  training capacity of the driving school.  Even

on  conclusion  of  eight weeks'  training,  it  is

incumbent on Unit Commanders to nurse these drivers

and  provide  them  with  additional  guidance  and

instruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of duty hours of vehicle drivers is

also being examined. It is not always the case that

drivers  are to blame. For instance, in an accident

last  month which received widespread publicity  in

the press, when an Army truck went off the road  at

Devil's Bend in Thomson Road, it was found that the

driver had been on duty for 19« hours at a stretch.

It  is obviously undesirable that drivers should be

subjected to such long stretches of duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these and other measures, there

are  signs  that the accident rate is  going  down.

Between January and September this year, there  was

one  accident  for every 9,600 miles  travelled  by

S.A.F, vehicles. Between October 1st and 15th,  the

accident  rate  was one accident for  every  12,700

miles,  It  is still too early to say whether  this

represents a real improvement which will  continue,

but  I  am optimistic that if we continue  to  take

resolute  measures,  the standards  of  driving  of

S.A.F, vehicles  will improve and  accident  rates

will go down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that the enforcement of these new

measures  will  result  in temporary  shortages  in

transport  for  military units.  If  this  happens,

civilian transport can be used as a supplement.  It

is  better  that this happens than that we  put  up

with  the  unsatisfactory state of  affairs  as  at

present.

<div align="center"><b>LEGISLATION FOR WORKERS'</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>WELFARE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour if he  will

consider  introducing a single piece of legislation

to  amend  and  consolidate the provisions  of  the

Factories  Ordinance,  the  Workmen's  Compensation

Ordinance   and  other  pertinent  laws   for   the

promotion  of  the safety, health  and  welfare  of

workers; and if such legislation will, among  other

things,  provide  for (a) the  establishment  of  a

council  of industrial safety and health  with  the

responsibility  of  (i) making safety  regulations;

(ii)  undertaking  research  and  safety  education

programmes;  (iii)  carrying  out  inspection   and

enforcement; and (iv) the rehabilitation of victims

of occupational hazards; (b) the establishment of a

board  to determine compensation; (c) the penalties

on  employers for committing breaches of  the  law;

and  (d) the establishment of safety committees  at

work  places to ensure that safety regulations  are

implemented.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

existing  legislation  on the  safety,  health  and

welfare  of  workers  is  found  in  the  Factories

Ordinance, the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance and

certain parts of the Employment Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be fitting if the objectives of these

Ordinances are similar for them to be consolidated.

Since  they  are  not, it will be inappropriate  to

consolidate  them in a single piece of legislation.

The Factories Ordinance is primarily concerned with

the  prevention  of  industrial accidents  and  the

maintenance of conditions which will not  adversely

affect the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



health   and   welfare  of  workers  in  industrial

establishments.    The    Workmen's    Compensation

Ordinance,  however,  is primarily  concerned  with

compensation  to  workmen who are incapacitated  by

accidents.  In the welfare parts of the  Employment

Act, the objectives are to ensure that workmen  are

not  made  to  work  excessively  long  hours,  and

employment of children, young persons and women  is

allowed  only  on  certain conditions.  Because  of

different objectives, the emphasis in the operation

of  each  of these Ordinances is different.  Whilst

the  emphasis  in  the operation of  the  Factories

Ordinance is preventive and technical, that of  the

Employment  Act  is supervisory  and  that  of  the

Workmen's Compensation Ordinance is administrative.

Another   good   reason   for   not   merging   the

abovementioned   three  laws  is   that   not   all

accidents,  the victims of which are  eligible  for

compensation,   fall   within   the   category   of

industrial   accidents,  or  occur  in   factories.

Accidents to workmen are known to occur on the high

seas  or on the roads, in open fields, offices  and

other places of employment which do not fall within

the  ambit  of the Factories Ordinance,  but  whose

victims  nevertheless  are eligible  for  workmen's

compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factories Ordinance will be amended to give

power  to  the  Minister to appoint  a  Council  of

Industrial  Safety  and Health  to  advise  him  on

matters  of safety and health in factories  and  to

recommend  lines  of research on  safety  education

programmes   to  be  undertaken  by   the   Factory

Inspectorate. This Council will be an advisory body

and not be empowered with executive functions since

such  functions  are  already  exercisable  by  the

Factory    Inspectorate.   Under   the    Factories

Ordinance,   penalties  have  been   provided   for

breaches of the law by factory occupiers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments will soon be made to the Workmen's

Compensation  Ordinance to increase  the  rates  of

compensation   as   well   as   to   make   certain

occupational  diseases  eligible  for  payment   of

workmen's compensation.

Sir,  can the Minister of State for Labour indicate

Compensation Ordinance will take place? His  answer

"soon"  is  not good enough. As a matter  of  fact,

this   issue   of   revision   of   the   Workmen's

Compensation Ordinance has been brought up in  this

House  often enough. During the last Budget debate,

quite  a  furore  was made over  it.  So  will  the

Minister of State for Labour clarify what he  means

correctly,  the  last  time when  the  question  of

workmen's  compensation was brought up, the  answer

was  that we were not ready then to make amendments

to  the  present Ordinance. But today I  am  saying

that we are going to do it and that the drafting of

all the new regulations is being made right now.

Communications if he will consider the  feasibility

of  providing for the payment of road tax on  motor

vehicles  at  post-offices where there already  are

facilities   for  the  renewal  of  motor   driving

licences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phua Bah Lee (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

asked by my Minister to answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the aim of the Ministry to make it possible

for  owners  of  motor vehicles to pay  their  road

taxes  at post-offices in the same manner  as  they

now renew their driving licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things are at present, many details have to be

manually  checked with the records, only  available

at  the Registry of Vehicles, Middle Road, so  that

payment  of road taxes has to be directed  to  this

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only after the Data Processing Unit of the

Ministry of Finance have successfully completed the

establishment  of a proper record  system  for  the

R.O.V, through data processing, which is  expected

to  be completed by next year (see para 12.4 of the

White   Paper  on  Reorganisation  of   the   Motor

<div align="center"><b>HOMES FOR THE AGED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number awaiting admission and expansion plans)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Seah Mui Kok</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs  how  many  poor aged people  are  awaiting

admission to Bushey Park Home, Woodlands  Home  and

Woodstock Home; and if lie has any plans to  expand

those Homes.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the short answers to the

Member's question are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) There are no poor aged persons awaiting

admission  to Bushey Park Home, Woodstock  Home  or

Woodlands Home. This is because it is not necessary

for  the  Social Welfare Department to  maintain  a

waiting  list  of applicants for admission  to  its

Homes, as each application received is immediately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



investigated   and   a   decision   made   on   the

application, which is either approved or  rejected,

depending  upon whether the applicant  can  satisfy

the conditions for admission or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) My Ministry has plans to expand or increase

the capacity of these three Homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to explain that Bushey

Park  Home  and  Woodstock  Home  are  gazetted  as

Welfare Homes for male and female destitute persons

respectively, and admissions to these two statutory

Homes  are  governed  by  the  provisions  of   the

Destitute Persons Act, 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Woodlands Home is a non-statutory Home for aged persons of both sexes, and

admissions to this Home are normally restricted  to

Singapore citizens who have attained the age of  60

years  and have no one to care for them. They  must

also  be  free  from infectious disease  or  mental

illness and be able to move about by themselves, as

the  Home does not have the facilities to care  for

the chronic sick and non-ambulant cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed capacity in Bushey Park Home was

increased from 180 to 210 in 1969 and will soon  be

further  increased to 270 with the purchase  of  60

new   double-decker   beds  for   the   able-bodied

destitutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed capacity in Woodstock Home is also being

increased from 80 to 100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed capacity in Woodlands Home is also being

increased  from 500 to 568. Tenders are also  being

invited   for   the   construction   of   two   new

dormitories.    When    completed,    the     total

accommodation   in  this  Home  will   be   further

increased to 704.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to mention, Sir, that these two new

dormitories  have  been made possible  through  the

public-spiritedness   and   generosity    of    the

following:

However,   owing  to  the  total  absence   of   an

taken  to  relocate  the  market  stallholders  and

<div align="center"><b>CONVERSION TO METRIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SYSTEM IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Science and Technology)</b></div>



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take

this opportunity to clarify a little the Report  on

Metrication  lest  rumours  spread  around  of  the

intentions  of  the  Government  with   regard   to

adopting a new system of weights and measures.  The

metric  system is currently used in more  than  120

countries  in  which 90 per cent of the  population

live and which account for 60 per cent of the Gross

National  Product  of the world.  Furthermore,  the

major  non-metric  countries  such  as  the  United

Kingdom,  Australia, New Zealand and  Canada,  with

the  exception of the United States of America, are

either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>







metricating  or  contemplating to  go  metric.  The

United  States  can  afford to  be  less  hasty  in

metricating  as  more  than  90  per  cent  of  her

industrial   products   are  internally   consumed.

Nevertheless,  a congressional committee  has  been

formed  to  study  the measures  to  be  taken  for

metrication in the United States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, almost all countries other than Hong

Kong,  Burma  and Brunei, are either already  using

the  metric  system or are metricating.  Japan  and

India have recently completed the conversion. Among

Southeast    Asian   countries,   Indonesia,    the

Philippines,  Thailand, Cambodia  and  Vietnam  are

already   using  the  metric  system.  Ceylon   has

announced her intention to metricate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, Singapore's trade with countries using

the  metric  system  and  those  committed  to  the

changeover constituted about 90 per cent (by value)

of  our  total external trade. Although Singapore's

trade with the United States has expanded from  4.7

per cent of total trade in 1965 to 9.1 per cent  in

1969,   the   items  likely  to  be   affected   by

metrication form only about 12.7 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are obvious advantages of adopting the

metric  system. Because it is decimally based,  the

conversion  from one unit to another requires  only

the  shifting  of the decimal place.  Its  inherent

simplicity  in  use  will benefit  all  sectors  of

economic  activities and the time saved in learning

other  systems of weights and measures  in  schools

could be more profitably spent for other purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall cost of conversion in a country

depends on the degree of industrialisation, but  if

conversion is necessary, it should commence as soon

as possible, as it has been estimated in the United

Kingdom that the costs of conversion increase at  a

rate  of 8 per cent for every year of delay. It  is

difficult   to  quantify  the  overall   costs   of

conversion,  which should include not  only  direct

costs,  but  also costs due to wastage and  initial

loss in efficiency arising from lack of familiarity

with the new system. In any case, any meaningful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



estimate  of the total capital expenditure required

to convert is difficult, but with careful planning,

expenditure  could be reduced to the  minimum.  For

example,  in  India, the cost of converting  petrol

pump  dials to measure in litres turned out  to  be

only  one per cent of the original estimate. A very

rough  estimate  of expenditure to be  incurred  by

Government  departments and  statutory  bodies  for

metrication is $5.6 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore's economy is very much dependent on

developments outside the country, we must  move  in

step  with the metricating world. The rubber  trade

in Singapore and Malaysia, for example, has decided

to  metricate with effect from 11th February, 1971,

following its acceptance of the recommendations  of

the  Metrication  Joint Working  Committee  set  up

recently by the Rubber Association of Singapore and

the   Malaysian  Rubber  Exchange.  The   Singapore

Telephone  Board has been informed by  a  telephone

cable supplier in the United Kingdom that new cable

specifications in metric units would be adopted  in

August 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent that as time goes on, the market

for  goods  with  specifications in imperial  units

will  get progressively smaller and those for goods

in metric units will, ipso facto, get larger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metrication will be introduced by administrative

action  first  in  the Government  departments  and

statutory  bodies.  The  Ministry  of  Science  and

Technology  has  made  a  study  of  the  technical

problems  involved  in  conversion  to  the  metric

system and the political and economic consequences.

A report of the study has been tabled in the House.

Chapter   4   summarises  the  findings  concerning

Government   departments  and   statutory   bodies,

excluding the Singapore Armed Forces. It  has  been

found  that  conversion can  commence  as  soon  as

possible in most of the Government departments  and

statutory bodies without incurring excessive costs,

which  fall  mainly in the purchase  of  equipment.

Some Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



departments  and statutory bodies,  in  fact,

need  to  metricate irrespective of  the  Singapore

Government's  decision,  because  of  international

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot introduce metrication in Government

departments  without affecting the private  sector,

as   members  of  the  public  have  dealings  with

Government departments. The problems of metrication

in  the private sector are more complex and  it  is

therefore intended that a Metrication Board,  which

will   consist   of  representatives   of   various

industries, will liaise with Government departments

to  ensure that metrication is introduced gradually

and  smoothly without dislocation of production and

trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to expect housewives, amahs or

hawkers to change overnight their familiarity  with

customary units of measures. There must be  a  long

period of propaganda and education to orientate the

public  towards the new system. For example,  those

who  are  accustomed to taking a pint of  beer  may

find  that half a litre is too little while a litre

is  too much. Market stall-holders used to charging

prices of meat, chicken and vegetables by the  kati

will find that charging by the kilogram will create

an impression of rising prices, although a kilogram

is  1.6 katis. The neater way is to use prices  per

half kilogram, but as this is only 82 per cent of a

kati, prices should be proportionately lowered. The

motorist will find that a gallon of petrol can take

him  30 miles, but if he buys a litre, it will give

him  only  one fifth the distance. Then again,  dua

belas batu Bukit Timah in miles is further than dua

belas  batu  in  kilometres. This can  confuse  the

postman  or someone who is trying to find his  way.

It is felt, therefore, that the retail trade sector

should   be  left  to  metricate  voluntarily   and

gradually  since this sector involves a  change  of

ingrained and accumulated habits of the majority of

the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no compensation will be paid to the

private   sector   for   costs   arising   out   of

metrication. The costs of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



conversion will lie where they fall. Conversion  to

the  metric system should not be used as a  pretext

for price increases or profiteering. Neither should

metrication cause the private sector undue or harsh

financial hardships. For these reasons, the process

of  conversion to the metric system should cover  a

period  of several years, although it is  our  hope

that  by 1975 all Government departments and three-quarters of private industries with external  trade

dealings will have converted to the metric system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is a large number of statutes in

Singapore   which  use  imperial   units,   it   is

cumbersome  to take each statute through Parliament

for amendment. A Metrication Bill will therefore be

introduced to enable necessary legal changes to  be

made  by  Gazette notification without taking  each

statute   through   Parliament.  Furthermore,   the

present Weights and Measures Ordinance (Cap.  230),

which  only  legalises  the local  (i.e.,  gantang,

chupak, kati, tahil) and imperial systems,  has  to

be  amended  to  include the metric  system.  Units

based  on the kilogram, metre and second are  being

used  in  many of the metric countries and accepted

by  nearly all the metricating countries. They  are

referred  to as the International System  of  Units

and  will  initially exist side by  side  with  the

local  and imperial systems currently in use. There

is,  however,  provision in the  proposed  Bill  to

empower  the  Minister to declare by  notification,

not  less  than five years after this Bill  becomes

law, any  unit to be invalid for use in Singapore,

with  a  proviso that the Minister can  exempt  any

person  or  department from the operation  of  such

notification.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL SERVICE POLICY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister of Defence)</b></div>



<br><br>3.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

normal  course  of events, detailed explanation  of

policy  arising out of new legislation is given  at

the Second Reading of the Bill, not at the time  of

its  introduction. In the case of the Bill which  I

am introducing today,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



the  Enlistment (Amendment) Bill, I will  not  have

the  opportunity under Standing Orders  to  make  a

statement  at the time of the introduction  of  the

Bill. I am therefore making a Ministerial statement

on  the subject under Standing Order 10. Enlistment

policy  has been a subject of heated public  debate

in recent weeks. The extraordinary thing about this

debate  was  that  members of the  Singapore  Armed

Forces  joined in the fray with great zest.  I  can

only assume that these soldiers were unaware of the

existence   of  Regulation  680  of   the   Queen's

Regulations.  It  is  hardly possible  under  these

circumstances  for the Government to announce  some

major   change  in  enlistment  policy  without   a

detailed   explanation  of   its   intentions.   An

explanation  is  all  the more necessary  as  there

seems  to be widespread public misconception  about

Government's policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When national service was introduced in 1967, it

appeared  that  Singapore  could  depend   on   the

extension of the British military presence until at

least  1975. Accordingly, the rate of our  military

build-up   was   planned  at  a  deliberate   pace.

Deferment  and  exemption from  full-time  national

service  were  freely granted. Boys leaving  school

and   admitted  to  the  University  were   granted

automatic  deferment.  Even  those  who   were   in

employment  were  exempted from full-time  national

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This liberal policy on exemption or deferment had

the   effect  of  restricting  full-time   national

service  intakes  mainly  to  boys  in  the   lower

educational  standards. There  was  a  shortage  of

officer material. To make up for this, the Ministry

of   Defence   recruited  persons  into   full-time

national service who entered Government service  or

the  service  of statutory authorities even  though

they  were  not  of the age groups currently  being

enlisted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When early in 1968 the British announced their

plan to accelerate the withdrawal of their military

forces  to he completed by the end of 1971, it  was

necessary  to  speed up the build-up of  our  Armed

Forces, in 1968 and 1969,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



University graduates were enlisted whether  or  not

they  were  recruited  into  the  service  of   the

Government  or the statutory authorities.  However,

such    enlistment    was   selective    and    not

comprehensive.  The  policy  of  allowing  boys  to

proceed  to the University on completion  of  their

H.S.C, examination continued in these two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1970, my predecessor decided to make a

comprehensive review of enlistment policy. By  that

time,  expansion of the Armed Forces  was  in  full

swing,  and  there was need to recruit an  enlarged

number  of  officer material to man  not  only  the

Combat  Units but also the logistic bases that  had

to  be established or expanded at great speed. Also

there  were  many staff positions  in  the  Defence

Ministry which had to be filled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major innovation which my predecessor

introduced  was  to change the policy  of  granting

exemption  for  students who  had  completed  their

H.S.C, examination  and  were  proceeding  to  the

University.  The decision was made that  for  1970,

half  of these would be enlisted and half deferred.

The   basis  for  deferment  in  respect  of  other

categories  of  age  registrants  was  examined  in

detail   and  rationalised.  Contrary  to   popular

opinion,  clearly defined rules were laid down  but

the details were not then published. The rules were

implemented by administrative measures. I am taking

this  opportunity today to publish rules that  were

laid  down  in  January  1970  by  my  predecessor,

together  with  an  indication whether  they  still

remain  in  force  or  not.  A  reference  to  this

document(See Annex, cols. 359-68),  which has been circulated  to  Members,

shows  that  nearly  all the  rules  laid  down  in

January 1970 remain in force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special arrangements have been made at the two

Universities  to  enable H.S.C, students  enlisted

this year to enter the University with minimum loss

of  time. As from next year the university  session

will commence in the first week



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



of July instead of May. H.S.C, students enlisted in

January this year and subsequently commissioned  as

officers  will  be  allowed  a  break  in  national

service  in  July  1972 when  they  will  join  the

University.   They  will  complete  their   service

liability,  usually another additional six  months,

during   the   University  long  vacation.   H.S.C.

students  enlisted in April will also be  permitted

to  join the University in July 1972, and they will

complete  their service liability during  two  long

vacations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the policy introduced in January this year,

it   was   envisaged   that  progressively   larger

proportions  of H.S.C, students would  be  enlisted

before  they  join the University. In 1971,  it  is

proposed to enlist three-quarters of them and defer

one-quarter. By 1973, all H.S.C, students  will  be

enlisted except for those awarded Colombo Plan  and

other  overseas scholarships, whose selection rests

with  the  Public  Service  Commission.  They  will

commence their national service on their due  dates

but  will be allowed to proceed overseas when their

university  term begins. They will  complete  their

national service on their return to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the position earlier this year. In

making a further review of enlistment policy, it is

necessary  to  take into account two  factors.  The

first  is  that  the British presence  will  remain

until  at  least 1975. This reduces the urgency  of

rapid    and   accelerated   expansion.   Secondly,

progressively  larger numbers  of  H.S.C, students

will be enlisted for full-time service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these factors reduce the need to enlist

University   graduates   for   full-time   national

service. Sooner or later, a decision must  be  made

on  the liability of University graduates for full-time  national service. The problem is a  difficult

one.  To continue past policies indefinitely  would

serve  the  interests of equity,  as  much  of  the

discontent  arising  among  graduates  in  national

service  is that enlistment had been selective  and

not  comprehensive. At the same time, it  is  clear

that a decision on liability of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



graduates cannot be deferred for long. I decided to

exclude  graduates  from the  October  1970  intake

unless  they  were  of  the age  group  liable  for

national  service in any event, that  is,  if  they

were born on or after 1st January, 1949. The result

of   this  decision  has  been  unhappiness   among

graduates now serving in the Armed Forces.  I  will

refer to this subject later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Enlistment Bill which I will soon be

introducing  reduces  the  period  of  service   of

national service officers from 3 years to 2 1/2 years.

It   increases  the  period  of  service  of   non-commissioned officers, corporals and above, from  2

years  to 2 1/2 years. The period of service of  other

ranks remains at 2 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Enlistment Bill will apply to national

servicemen enlisted as from 1971. It will not apply

to national servicemen already in the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Ministry of Defence to

enlist  H.S.C, students in the January  and  April

intakes  in 1971. Those most likely to be  admitted

to  the  University - this will be judged by  their

school   examination  results,  since  the   H.S.C.

results  will not be known in time - will be  taken

into  the January intake. This will enable them  to

complete  the 2«-year service in time for admission

to the Universities in July 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the light of this new enlistment policy

that  I want to discuss the subject of exit permits

for  those children whose parents want them  to  do

their secondary education overseas. At present,  if

they are less than 16½- years of age, they are  not

granted   passports  and  there  have   been   some

complaints in the newspaper columns by parents  who

wish  to  send their children abroad. My colleague,

the  Minister for Home Affairs, will be introducing

a new Passports Bill which will allow conditions to

be  laid  down on the issue of passports.  It  will

then  be  possible  to  issue  such  passports   to

children  under  the  age of 16«  intending  to  go

abroad for secondary school education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as their national service liability is

concerned, they will be treated exactly on the same

footing  as  children who do their education  here.

Under  no  circumstances  will  these  children  be

treated as a privileged group. The Government fully

endorses the position recently taken by the  unions

affiliated  to the National Trades Union  Congress.

Parents   will  be  required  to  furnish  adequate

security by way of cash bond or bank guarantee that

when their children reach their 18th birthday, they

will  return to Singapore to do full-time  national

service.  Deferment will not be granted on  grounds

that  the  students  have  secured  a  place  in  a

University,  or,  for  that matter,  on  any  other

grounds. The bond will be forfeited if the children

do  not return, but forfeiture of the bond will not

preclude the Government from taking other steps  to

secure the return of the student to Singapore to do

his full-time national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now deal with those graduates who were born

before  1st  January, 1949, and who are  now  doing

full-time national service. They feel that they are

being  let  down.  Some  have  even  asked  to   be

discharged  from the Army. There is, of course,  no

question of agreeing to this: if any redress is  to

be found for them, it must lie in the enlistment of

those  graduates who were due to be  enlisted  last

month, but who had been let off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the graduates now doing national service,

especially  those  who  have been  commissioned  as

officers,   I  want  to  say  that  the  Government

acknowledges  that it has a special  obligation  to

them.  Those with the requisite qualifications  who

wish   to  apply  for  appointments  in  the  civil

service, especially in the higher services such  as

the  Administrative service, will find  that  their

military  service will be given due recognition  by

the Public Service Commission. I have the agreement

of  the Chairman, Public Service Commission, to say

this.   Furthermore,   the   P.S.C, will   review

examination  requirements in the civil service  for

national service officers recruited into the  civil

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



It  would be possible to exempt these officers from

some,    probably   most,   of   the    examination

requirements.  They  will  also  be  given  special

consideration   in  respect  of   requirements   of

probationary service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers who are due to complete their national

service  next year may apply for vacancies  in  the

government  service while still  in  the  Army, lf

appointed to the civil service, their Army  service

will count as pensionable service and they will get

full  increments for the years of  service  in  the

Army.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence is proposing to make

available  a  number  of  scholarships  for  under-graduate  and  post-graduate studies in  the  local

Universities  as  well  as  overseas  Universities.

Officers  on  completion of their national  service

who are willing to accept a regular commission will

be  eligible  to  apply for these scholarships.  If

they  are  awarded  such  scholarships,  they  will

receive  full  pay as regular officers  during  the

tenure of their scholarships. Conditions of service

in  the  Army,  which  are at present  governed  by

Malaysian  regulations, will be revised to  greatly

improved levels. I will give more details of  these

subjects at the Second Reading of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another way in which the Government will

be  able  to discharge its obligation to  full-time

national servicemen. This is by way of implementing

the  National Servicemen (Employment) Act which was

passed by Parliament on 26th June, 1970. A Director

of Employment has been appointed. He is Mr Lee Ong

Pong,    formerly   Director   of   the    National

Productivity  Centre.  The  Department   is   being

established  and  should be  in  operation  in  two

months' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All national servicemen are covered by the

National  Servicemen (Employment)  Act  during  the

whole period of their reserve liability. University

graduates who obtained a commission in the Army and

who   do  not  belong  to  the  normal  age   group

registration, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



a  claim  for special attention of the Director  of

Employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the National Servicemen (Employment) Act,

employers  will  be  required  to  engage  national

service   reservists  unless  they  have   obtained

exemption from the Director of Employment.  So  the

graduate officer throughout the whole period of his

reserve liability will have a safety net should  he

decide  to try his fortunes in the private  sector.

His  contemporaries who were not enlisted will have

to  fend for themselves if, for instance, they lose

their jobs in the private sector, as is not unknown

to happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several other implications in the

change of period of enlistment, but my statement is

already  too long and these will have to  wait  for

the Second Reading of the Bill. However, I want  to

make  brief references to two consequences of  some

significance.   The   first   is   that    officers

commissioned  under tht existing  Act  have  to  do

three  years' service as against 2« years for those

enlisted  from  1971 onwards. While many  will  not

regard  a  difference of six  months  as  of  great

moment, others, especially the graduates, may  feel

that  their frustrations are being compounded.  The

other  point  is that the reduction  to  2«  years'

service  for officers creates very serious problems

in support arms combat units, such as the artillery

and the engineers. The training period for officers

in  these units is close on two years. I will  deal

with these matters and their possible solutions  at

some  length in my Second Reading speech. I mention

these  in  passing to register the point that  they

are being looked into.

the  School  of  Education  at  the  University  of

Singapore,  which together provide a  programme  of

training encompassing a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



variety  of courses at different levels of training

in   the   four   language  streams,   leading   to

certificate,      diploma     and     post-graduate

qualifications  in  education.  In  addition,   the

Teachers'  Training College, which  undertakes  the

major part of the training programme with a student

enrolment of more than 2,300 in 1969, also conducts

numerous  in-service courses on a wide  variety  of

subjects  for  qualified teachers.  The  School  of

Education  offers only post-graduate  courses,  but

caters  jointly with the Teachers' Training College

for the basic training of graduate teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two institutions have hitherto fulfilled

an  essential need in the training of  teachers  to

staff  our  schools.  But he  establishment  of  an

Institute  of  Education to  centralise  the  whole

training   programme  under  a  single   autonomous

statutory  body  will be a positive advancement  in

teacher   education   in   Singapore,   from    the

administrative, professional and academic points of

view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of an independent, statutory

Institute   of   Education  will   remove   certain

limitations  inherent in the present administration

of  the  Teachers' Training College as a Government

department. At present, recruitment to posts at the

Teachers' Training College is usually limited  only

to  members  of  the  Education  Service.  Further,

promotion of lecturers after a certain point  leads

staff  members to principal-ships and positions  in

the  Inspectorate, resulting in a constant turnover

of staff at the College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, the Institute of

Education,  when  established,  will  be  able,  by

virtue  of  its independent status, to appoint  its

teaching  staff  at professorial and  other  levels

through open advertisement and selection on a merit

basis. This will also encourage response from those

with   outstanding  qualifications  who  would   be

willing to contribute to the advancement of teacher

education but are reluctant to be associated with a

Government body. The Institute will also  be  in  a

position,  by virtue of its autonomous  status,  to

offer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



terms  and conditions of service commensurate  with

the  qualifications  of  the  staff  it  hopes   to

attract.   Visiting  professors  of   international

standing  will  be  recruited  to  teach   at   the

institute,   and   only   highly   qualified    and

experienced  educators will be recruited  into  its

permanent establishment. These conditions  will  be

more   conducive   to   the  attainment   of   good

professional and academic standards, as well as  to

the conducting of educational research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute will have powers to confer degrees

and diplomas and to grant certificates to those who

successfully  complete  its courses.  One  proposed

innovation which deserves particular mention is the

introduction, at a later stage, of courses  leading

to  the degrees of Bachelor of Education and Master

of  Education.  The institution of  a  Bachelor  of

Education degree has certain advantages. It  has  a

potential for improving the quality of the teaching

force,  as students will be firmly committed  to  a

teaching  career before they embark on the  course,

which  will be of three years' duration.  There  is

also  the time-saving aspect, as it will take  only

three years to produce a graduate teacher, compared

to  four  years  as at present. The  conferment  of

degrees  will  also  enhance  the  status  of   the

teaching   profession.  A  scheme  may   later   be

introduced to enable non-graduate serving  teachers

to obtain this degree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the Institute, the

School  of Education at the University of Singapore

will be gradually phased out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute will co-operate with all other

tertiary institutions on professional matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, provision is made for the

Institute  to  be  managed by a Council  including,

among its members, representatives from Government,

the  two  local  Universities, Ngee  Ann  Technical

College, professional bodies and organisations, and

the Institute itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Director, to be appointed by the Council, will

be the chief administrative and academic officer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Board of Studies will be established to advise

the  Council on academic matters pertaining to  the

Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education is empowered under the Bill to make grants to the Institute out of funds to be provided by the House, and any funds received or raised by the Institute will be controlled and administered by the Council subject to the directions of the Minister. Annual and

supplementary  estimates of expenditure  must  have

the prior approval of the Minister and all accounts

of expenditure will be audited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may also transfer to the Institute the assets and property of the Government held for the purposes of the Teachers' Training College in Singapore. Gifts to the Institute will be granted tax relief as it will be deemed an institution of a public character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>3.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as a teacher, I rise to support this

Bill.  I welcome it because, under it, an Institute

of  Education  will be established to  provide  for

teacher training. An opportunity will also be given

for  research  in  education,  which  is  in  great

demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the task of teacher training has all along been entrusted to the Teachers' Training College, which has been able to train about 20,000 teachers for the Republic. Perhaps due to the heavy work undertaken by the T.T.C, and the great number of teachers it has to train, there is

still  much room for improvement in the formulation

of curricula. Most of the trainee-teachers have one

common  feeling-that it is a drudgery for  them  to

undergo training at the T.T.C. The curricula at the

T.T.C, are very complex and varied. Some parts  are

not practical. Most of the student teachers are  in

jitters  trying their best to meet the requirements

of  their lecturers, hoping to go through the  mill

as quickly as possible in order to gain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



a  certificate to make a living. However,  many  of

them  feel that what they have learnt at the T.T.C.

cannot be put into practice in the classrooms. What

the lecturers advocate in the T.T.C, may not be the

same  as  what  is  demanded by the  inspectors  of

schools.  So  the  teachers do  not  know  whom  to

please. However, it must be admitted that there are

many  good  teachers and lecturers  at  the  T.T.C.

However,  these teachers are sometimes  transferred

to  the  Ministry of Education to do administrative

work,  or  they  may be appointed as principals  in

secondary  schools.  We  know  that  we  need  good

lecturers  to  train  good teachers.  We  hope  the

Institute  of  Education will be  able  to  recruit

capable  teachers and lecturers and devise  methods

to retain the services of these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the T.T.C, is taken into the Institute of

Education,  its  many  good  features   should   be

incorporated   into   the   Institute    and    its

shortcomings  rectified so that the  Institute  can

become a centre for the training of the "engineers"

of our national mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the course of education is a long process and knowledge in education is increasing rapidly. Teachers should improve themselves by attending courses and seminars. The Ministry should encourage teachers to improve themselves. There are teachers with a B.A, degree who, after attending

courses, are able to get a Master's degree. But  in

spite  of  this additional qualification, they  are

given  the  pay  of  an Honours graduate.  This  is

unreasonable.  I  have received petitions  on  this

matter from more than 10 teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, teachers in secondary and primary schools have limited opportunities for promotion. Some of them, faithful to their duty, remain teachers throughout their whole lives. The Ministry should think of ways and means to give primary school teachers an opportunity for further

study and obtain higher academic qualifications  to

become   qualified   secondary   school   teachers.

Teachers in the secondary schools should be given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



an  opportunity  to  do research  in  education  to

acquire a higher degree. They should be given fully-paid leave while doing their research. I would like

to  ask  the  Minister  whether  the  Institute  of

Education will give them such opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, education is a lengthy process, and about three-quarters of our population are school children. What will become of them will depend on the 20,000-odd teachers. The setting up of the Institute of Education will help raise the quality of teachers which, in turn, will enhance

the  quality of the population. Let me reaffirm  my

stand. I fully support this Bill.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the first thing I wish to say is that I am glad  an

amendment is proposed to clause 4 (1) (c)  of  this

Bill,  so  that one of the objects of the Institute

of  Education will be the promotion of research  in

education  and  not, as could have been  originally

implied,  the  promotion  of  research  in  teacher

education. Whatever possible implications there may

be,  the  wording  of  the  original  paragraph  in

question   seems   to  me  to   have   been   quite

unsatisfactory. Now we have a clearer and,  indeed,

a  more liberal statement of the research functions

of the Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what are the functions of the Institute in

respect of the education of our teachers? I  notice

that  courses  of  study will be provided  for  the

training  of  teachers  in the  various  fields  of

education at all levels. This would imply that  the

Institute  may be the only duly accredited  teacher

education  establishment in Singapore. Inasmuch  as

the T.T.C, has already done this, the Institute  is

certainly  going to take over what used to  be  the

functions  of  the  University  of  Singapore,  for

example, at the level of graduate teacher training.

Thus  we  find  that this Institute  is  apparently

going   to  be  endowed  with  pretty  wide-ranging

functions.  This view is somewhat substantiated  by

clause 4 (2) (e) , by which this Institute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



will   be   empowered   to  institute   and   award

fellowships,  exhibitions and so on, and  forms  of

assistance    towards    the    advancement     and

dissemination of knowledge, presumably knowledge in

general,  because no qualification  is  stipulated.

And  yet when we look at clause 4 (1) (a) , we  find

that  the  study courses provided will be  for  the

training of teachers in education. In other  words,

it  seems  to  me  that  the  emphasis  is  on  the

pedagogical  aspects of training, to the  exclusion

of  the  academic aspects. We have just  heard  the

Minister for Education say that the Institute  will

introduce  courses  leading to  the  award  of  the

degrees  of  Bachelor of Education  and  Master  of

Education.   Presumably,   the   people   who   are

candidates  for these degrees will be  coming  from

schools with the Higher School Certificate  or  the

School  Leaving Certificate. It seems  to  me  that

these   people  will  have  to  be  provided   with

knowledge of the contents of certain disciplines as

well as knowledge of the pedagogical aspects of how

they  are going to teach these disciplines  in  the

schools. So we have to think of equipping the would-be  teachers  themselves in the various disciplines

apart  from  education. These teachers,  especially

those  going  to  the secondary and  post-secondary

classes, will have to possess an adequate and,  may

I  emphasise,  a lively knowledge of  the  subjects

they will have to teach. And yet the objects of the

Institute are expressed in this Bill in terms  that

seem  to  exclude the equipping of  our  apprentice

teachers with the effective knowledge of what  they

are going to teach as apart from how they are going

to teach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that whoever gave the brief for

the  drafting  of  the objects of  this  Institute,

especially in their original form, may have had the

present Teachers' Training College in mind.  It  is

hoped  that this Bill will not simply result  in  a

more  impressive name for the T.T.C., but that  the

opportunity will be grasped for a new milestone  to

be marked in the fundamental development of teacher

education facilities in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Jurong that the

Teachers' Training College has served a most useful

purpose.  While taking as much care as possible  to

ensure  quality within the prevailing  constraints,

its  chief function has been to produce the  number

of teachers required to staff the schools which the

Government has been energetically establishing.  It

is  time  now to consolidate our position vis-a-vis

the  quality of our educators. Nowhere in the  Bill

is there any indication of the relationship of this

Institute   to  other  institutions   of   tertiary

education   in  Singapore.  Thus  this   autonomous

Institute of Education has the grave responsibility

of  ensuring  the quality of the teachers  we  will

produce  and  that  the teachers  we  have  already

produced  will  be  given  all  the  facilities  to

develop   to   their  satisfaction   and   to   the

satisfaction of our society in their chosen career.

Inasmuch  as our teacher educators have been  equal

to  the  particular challenges of the past, I  hope

they   will   be  equal  to  the  more  significant

challenges of the future.



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Bill  before this House seeks to  establish  a

corporate  body  to be known as the  "Institute  of

Education"  which  will  make  provision  for   the

training  of  teachers  in  Singapore  and  promote

research in the various fields of education. To  my

mind,  this  move  opens up a new spectrum  in  our

present efforts to seek qualitative improvement  in

our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the financial and human resources available

to  the  Education Ministry in the past were geared

and  strained to meet the expansion of  schools  to

meet  the objective of providing every school-going

child a place in school, with the result that  very

little attention was paid to the improvement in the

quality of education. Whatever efforts were made in

the   past   in   the  direction   of   qualitative

improvement  were  only ad hoc  measures  and  were

neither comprehensive nor co-ordinated. It is hoped

that with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



establishment  of the Institute of  Education,  all

efforts  aimed  at qualitative improvement  in  all

aspects  of  our educational system,  ranging  from

curriculum development to teacher training, will be

carried  out more systematically, efficiently,  and

with  imagination,  with a  touch  of  professional

expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the attainment of the objective of

quantitative  education, it is now imperative  that

study  and  research  be made  into  the  different

aspects of our educational development in the  past

decade.   In   the  past,  changes  made   in   the

educational system were not only radical and rapid,

but  were  also  made  to meet  certain  underlying

political objectives of nation-building,  with  the

result   that   high  educational   standards   and

objectives sometimes had to be sacrificed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in his right frame of mind will dispute

the  need to gear our educational system to  attain

certain   underlying   political   objectives    of

inculcating  a  sense  of  loyalty  and  pride   of

belonging  to Singapore, of building a multi-racial

and  harmonious  society, and of restructuring  our

educational  system to meet the needs  of  manpower

requirements  in the fast-changing pattern  of  our

economic development and progress. What I  wish  to

point  out, however, is that we must not lose sight

of  the educational standards and objectives at the

same  time.  Whether  -a  review  is  necessary  of

certain  educational  activities  that  have   been

carried  out so far in Singapore schools,  and  how

improvements  can  be  made  in  the  direction  of

qualitative education, are matters that require the

attention of educational experts engaged in  proper

research, study and analysis of the various  fields

of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that the proposed Institute of

Education  will have, among its staff, experts  who

will  be able to evaluate the progress we have made

in  our educational development in the past decade,

as  well as spotlight the pitfalls we have stumbled

into,    and    make    expert    and    applicable

recommendations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



for improvement in qualitative education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another subject that will come

within  the  purview of the proposed  Institute  of

Education - I am referring to teacher training. The

adaptation of our educational system to  the  needs

of  modem Singapore necessitates higher and broader

qualifications for the teachers who  will  have  to

prepare  young  people  to live  and  work  in  the

context  of  an increasingly complex  economic  and

social  organisation. Moreover,  the  good  initial

training for teachers is not enough at a time  like

ours  when  the  content,  methods  and  media   of

education   are  necessarily  undergoing   constant

changes.  The systematic organisation of  refresher

and advanced courses and a wide range of in-service

courses  on teachers' education will enable serving

teachers  to  add continually to their professional

as  well as academic knowledge, and keep up to date

with  developments in all fields  of  education  so

that  they  will not lose touch with  progress  and

become   inefficient.  But   improvement   in   the

economic, no less than the professional, status  of

teachers is required if serving teachers are to  be

encouraged  to  feel obliged to  seek  professional

improvement. The improvement of the economic status

of   teachers  is  primarily  a  matter  of  social

justice, since the qualifications required for this

category of workers and the tasks assigned to  them

are  becoming  ever  more  complex  and  demanding,

particularly  when their role is  extending  beyond

the confines of the schools because of the part the

teachers  must play today in community development.

Teachers  must  enjoy  a status  commensurate  with

their role.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Institute of Education, in

consultation with teachers' unions, should  promote

the  establishment of a wide system  of  in-service

teacher  education, and adequate incentive schemes,

devised   by   the  Ministry  of  Education   after

consultation  with  teachers'  unions,  should   be

offered   to   serving   teachers   on   successful

completion  of  any  in-service course  on  teacher

education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute should also focus its attention on

developments  in  the  education  service,  keeping

schools  abreast  of the results  of  research  and

methodological progress, as well as  reflecting  in

its   own  work  the  experience  of  schools   and

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute should also provide adequate

further  teacher-education  programmes  to   enable

serving  non-graduate teachers in both primary  and

secondary schools to seek professional and academic

advancement especially when they are required  from

time  to  time  to shoulder additional professional

responsibilities. The present non-graduate teachers

are a case in point. Though trained essentially  to

teach  in primary schools, they are posted to teach

in   secondary  schools,  sometimes  at  the  upper

secondary   level   of  education   where   trained

university graduate teachers are supposed to teach.

This  has been the position in the past decade when

the  Education  Ministry has been  faced  with  the

problem  of  attracting and recruiting an  adequate

number  of university graduate teachers to man  the

secondary schools particularly from secondary three

level upwards. It is a credit to those serving non-graduate  teachers that they have admirably  played

their role and proved their ability and worth. They

have  discharged their responsibilities  very  well

and  produced  good results with the students  that

they  have  taught. It can also be said  that  many

serving  non-graduate teachers in primary  schools,

when posted to secondary schools, will also respond

just  as  well  to their new role. This  is  to  be

expected as they all went through the same training

in the Teachers' Training College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No recognition of any kind is given to the non-graduate teachers in secondary schools for

shouldering increased responsibilities that  should

normally  be  carried  out by  university  graduate

teachers. It is imperative, therefore, that one  of

the   paramount  concerns  of  the   Institute   of

Education must be the promotion of further teacher-education  programmes  at degree/diploma  level  to

enable serving non-graduate teachers to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



avail  themselves of such opportunities to increase

their   academic   knowledge  and   upgrade   their

professional  skills  and  status   so   that,   on

successful   completion  of   such   degree/diploma

teacher-education courses, they can  be  placed  on

par  with university graduate teachers in terms  of

status and service conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that consideration must be given

to   the   fact   that  many  serving  non-graduate

teachers,  meriting consideration for  professional

and  academic upgrading courses, are often  married

men   with   both  responsibilities  and  financial

commitments  that  normally go  with  married  men.

Leave for studies in such courses therefore must be

on  full pay, and their experience in teaching must

be  taken as adequate entry qualification  for  any

such courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent for me at this juncture to seek

clarification  from the Minister for  Education  on

the following queries that I wish to raise:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. During the transitional period of change when

teacher  training is transferred from  the  present

Teachers'   Training  College   to   the   proposed

Institute   of  Education,  is  the   Ministry   of

Education  taking immediate steps  to  recruit  and

train  more  teachers  to meet  the  present  acute

shortage   of   teachers  in  the  schools   today,

normalise  the  staffing position in  schools,  and

reduce to the minimum the present position where  a

far  too  excessive number of relief  teachers  are

employed  on  an ad hoc basis to meet  the  present

acute shortage of teachers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Why is the Ministry of Education not providing

opportunities  to  the  present  pool   of   relief

teachers  to  undergo  teacher  training  and  seek

permanent employment in the Ministry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Is the Ministry aware that while, on the one

hand,  there is a shortage of teachers, there  are,

on  the  other  hand, some teachers who  have  just

completed  their  full-time teacher  training  this

year who are not offered employment in the teaching

service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Does the Minister for Education envisage the

proposed  Institute of Education  to  continue  the

present policy in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



respect  of teacher training, namely, that  student

teachers, on successful completion of their teacher

training, will not be guaranteed employment in  the

education  service?  If this policy  is  continued,

does   the  Ministry  not  see  this  as  a   great

disincentive  to future aspirants to  the  teaching

service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. What will happen to the fate of the present

lecturing  staff in the Teachers' Training  College

when teacher training is taken over by the proposed

Institute of Education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Will those members of the present T.T.C.

lecturing staff holding substantive appointments as

assistant lecturers, lecturers, etc., at present be

absorbed  automatically  into  the  staff  of   the

Institute  of Education? And will those members  of

the  present T.T.C, lecturing staff holding  acting

appointments   and  who  have  given   satisfactory

lecturing  service for a period of  time  be  given

special  preference  by the proposed  Institute  of

Education in its recruitment of staff?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. What will be the scheme of service of the staff

of  the proposed Institute of Education? Will it be

similar  to the existing scheme of service  of  the

present  T.T.C, lecturing staff,  or  will  it  be

similar  to  existing schemes  of  service  in  the

Polytechnic or Ngee Ann Technical College?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Will the present T.T.C, lecturing staff be given

an  opportunity  to  make  representations  through

their teachers' union on their future position when

the  proposed Institute of Education is established

and  takes  over  the function of teacher  training

from the present T.T.C.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, in conclusion, express the hope that, as

a  result  of  the  proposed establishment  of  the

Institute   of  Education,  the  current  promotion

exercise  for  T.T.C, lecturers  in  relation   to

appointments in the T.T.C, will not be frozen,  but

will  be  carried out as indicated  in  the  recent

vacancy minute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to add that the term "teachers" in

the context of my speech



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



today  also  includes principals of schools,  since

they are also practising teachers basically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br>4.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel that the Institute of Education Bill is

an  important  Bill because it will make  provision

for  the  training of teachers in our  country.  In

recent  years,  we have heard from various  sources

that  we  will raise the quality of our educational

system in order to produce qualified personnel  who

will be able to make a contribution to our country.

The  Institute  of Education will become  a  higher

institution  of education for our country  and  can

change  the  nature and quality of our  educational

system  for the better. It is most appropriate  for

Members  to contribute their views to the House  on

this Bill. I would like to add only a few points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has said that at present

there are shortcomings in the courses conducted  by

the  Teachers' Training College. He feels that some

of  them are of no practical value. But he has  not

suggested to the House how to improve these courses

so  as  to  make them more practical  in  order  to

benefit  the  younger  generation.  We  have  often

stressed that there is a shortage of technical  and

managerial personnel. We have often heard that  the

number of students turned out by our schools cannot

meet  the  demands  of our industries  and  various

institutions. I would like to ask the  Minister  to

pay  special attention to this problem and get  the

Institute to speed up its output of students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I would like to make is

that  we should have teachers and teacher educators

with good physique because we are striving to build

a  rugged  society. So we should also pay attention

to  this aspect of physical education, particularly

for teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I want to make touches on the

field  of  culture. We are very short  of  artistic

personnel - artists,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



cultural activists and others in the field of  fine

arts  and  drama. I hope there will be teachers  to

fill  this gap, and also that art courses  will  be

conducted.  If the Institute of Education  develops

along  the  proper channels, it  will  be  able  to

produce sufficient talented people for our nation.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me join

my  colleagues, the Members for Jurong, Katong  and

Moulmein, in complimenting the Minister on bringing

forth this Institute of Education Bill which is, in

my  opinion, a little long overdue. Let me  at  the

same time hasten to add my tribute to the T.T.C, to

which  I  believe we are playing a swan  song.  The

T.T.C, did  its  duty when we wanted  quantitative

education. We have spoken on qualitative  education

before.  In establishing an Institute of  Education

which we hope will bring about teachers of quality,

there are a number of matters that we will have  to

take into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the important aspects in our secondary

education  today  is, as has already  been  pointed

out,  mainly  managed  by  teachers  who  are  non-graduates and who are not really trained  to  teach

in  secondary schools. We owe a great debt to these

non-graduate teachers in our secondary schools  for

the  unstinted service that they have put  in  over

the years. I hope this Institute will give them  an

opportunity  to  better  themselves  so  that   the

standard  of qualitative education and the contents

of  the  subjects being taught in secondary schools

are  improved. I was glad to hear from the Minister

that  the Institute will open its doors to  serving

teachers  to  improve their teaching techniques  as

well as knowledge of the contents of the subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the number of Honours graduates

and  graduate  teachers  in  secondary  schools  is

limited.  They specialise in certain  subjects  and

prefer  to  teach only the subjects in  which  they

obtain  their  Honours degrees,  whereas  the  non-graduate teachers - unfortunately being specialists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



in  nothing  -- are expected to teach all  subjects

allotted  to them. Therefore, I would suggest  that

in  giving  in-service courses to the  non-graduate

teachers who are teaching in secondary schools now,

we  may  have to shorten the course that a  school-leaver  would normally have to undergo to  complete

his Bachelor of Education Degree. The Minister says

that the BE. Degree course will be done in a three-year  period.  I  presume  this  three-year  period

course is for those fresh from school who have gone

into  the Institute of Education to obtain the B.E.

Degree. Teachers who have served a number of  years

in secondary schools should be given an opportunity

to  complete the course earlier. If this course  is

going   to   be  a  full-time  course,   sufficient

incentive should be given to them. In other  words,

paid  leave should be given to them to attend these

courses full-time, or a part-time in-service course

leading to a degree. In this way, they can learn as

well  as teach at the same time. I am not too  sure

if  these questions have been thrashed out. If they

have  been, I would like to hear from the  Minister

of  any  details  that he has worked  out  for  the

serving teachers in secondary schools to go to  the

Institute  to  obtain a degree. We  have  heard  on

previous  occasions  that  serving  teachers   were

having difficulty in obtaining permission to attend

university  courses  on paid  leave.  Further,  the

University  is  not  providing  in-service  courses

which  will  lead to a degree or higher  degree.  A

number of teachers went to the University and did a

degree  course,  but  they never  returned  to  the

schools.  I hope we will not make the same  mistake

and that some sort of arrangements will be made  so

that we will continue to have their services.



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad

that  the  Member for Telok Blangah has  spoken  in

appreciation   of  the  role  that  the   Teachers'

Training College has played in the expansion of our

educational  services. Just now we heard  from  the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



for  Jurong  who said that although the T.T.C, had

trained 20,000 teachers, there were certain aspects

with which he was not happy. I do not think this is

the  time  and  place to consider  the  merits  and

demerits of the T.T.C. It is most appropriate  that

we  should  pay  tribute to  an  institution  which

served its purpose well during a period when we had

to expand the educational service quantitatively. I

would  not  like  to  be drawn  into  a  debate  on

conditions  of  service by the Member  for  Jurong.

There will be a time and occasion for that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of setting up the Institute of Education by the Ministry of Education is to raise the standard of teaching, and though it is not written in detail in the Bill, it is, of course, implied that students who attend the Institute will be inculcated with what the Member

for  Katong described as "a lively knowledge of the

subjects  which they will be teaching". It  is  not

possible to spell out in detail the objects, but  I

believe they are implied there, and I can rely upon

members of the Council, when they are appointed, to

see  that  the teachers who are turned out  by  the

Institute  will have a lively knowledge and  lively

curiosity  of  the  subjects  which  they  will  be

teaching. I can assure the Member for Moulmein that

I will always make full use of professional advice.

In my career I have found that it is always wise to

listen  to, though not always to accept, the advice

of  the professionals. I can assure the Member  and

his  colleagues that I will make full use of  their

knowledge  of the teaching service. I  will  do  my

very  best  to  tap  all  that  I  can  from  their

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted the suggestion made by the Member

for Moulmein on the in-service scheme and I am sure

the  Council of the Institute will look  thoroughly

into the proposal which he has made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member seeks clarification on certain

questions  that  he has posed. I  am  not  able  to

answer them in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



order  that  he put them, but I would say  this  in

regard  to  the  position of the-present  lecturing

staff  of  the  T.T.C, when the Teachers'  Training

College   is   taken  over  by  the  Institute   of

Education. Let me assure the Member that they  will

be in no way worse off than they are. The Teachers'

Training  College is-now part of  the  Ministry  of

Education.  If  any  of the  staff  there  are  not

absorbed  by the Institute of Education, they  will

be taken into the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the scheme of service-for the

Institute of Education, it is too early yet  to  go

into the details, but since this is an institute of

tertiary  education, I will equate  it  with  other

institutes  of  tertiary education.  The  Institute

will have chairs, professorships, lectureships  and

other  posts  and  officers  in  keeping  with  its

status.  I  do  not think the terms and  conditions

will be in any way inferior to those obtainable  in

the T.T.C, now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government does not stop its employees

from  making representations to it, I do not  think

there  is  any need for them to go to the teachers'

unions   for  any  representation  in  this   case,

because,  as  I  say,  they will  be  in  no  worse

position than they are now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying our best to redress the shortage of

teachers.   This   year  we  have   put   out   two

advertisements for teachers, but the  response  has

not been very encouraging. This is something beyond

our  control, and I am afraid we have to  use  non-graduate teachers to fill the breach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the question of relief teachers. The

Member  mentioned relief teachers seeking  training

and   permanent  employment  in  the  Ministry   of

Education.  The opportunity is always  there.  They

can  always make their applications and every  case

will be considered on its own merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein also brought up the

question  of shortage of teachers. He alleged  that

while  there  is a shortage of teachers  under  the

present  circumstances, those  who  have  qualified

have not been offered employment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



These  cases are very few and far between. This  is

largely due to some administrative difficulties.  I

shall be very glad if these cases can be brought to

my    notice.   If   they   have   the    requisite

qualifications, I will see that they are  appointed

immediately. This is one of the problems caused  by

our  not  having enough wide-awake  people  in  our

administration.  I  can quote  a  case.  I  sent  a

telegram  here from Geneva. It arrived on the  same

day, but it took two days for it to travel from the

ground  floor to the seventh floor of the  Ministry

of  Education  to  the  Acting  Minister!  This  is

probably  one of the snags which have held  up  the

appointment  of  suitably qualified  teachers  even

though we are really short of teachers. May I  also

say  that we are looking into the case that I  have

just quoted, where it took longer for a telegram to

climb up six floors than for it to come from Geneva

to  here.  I  think  I have answered  most  of  the

problems  raised. There may be one or  two  others,

but  they are not really significant. They  can  be

raised later on if the occasion arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Minister responsible for the portfolio of

sports, I feel that today is an auspicious  one  in

that I have the pleasure and privilege to move  the

Third  and  final  Reading of  this  Bill  for  the

establishment  of  the  National  Sports  Promotion

Board for acceptance by the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill was first introduced by me on 11th June,

1969,  and was read a Second time on 15th  October,

1969,  and  committed  to a Select  Committee..  An

advertisement  was  inserted  in  the  local  press

inviting     representations    from     interested

institutions and individuals and from the public on

a  subject of importance. But, unfortunately,  only

four  written  representations were  received,  and

these,   too,  after  the  closing  date  on   15th

November, 1969. I would have wished that the  press

had given more publicity and constructive criticism

on the Bill itself, which would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



have    evoked    more    public    interest    and

representations  to the Select Committee.  However,

it  is also possibly a sign of the inherent virtues

and  merits  in  the Bill that  it  has  had  plain

sailing  in  its  passage through  Parliament,  the

press and the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly impressed with the

representation  made by the Hon. Secretary  of  the

Football   Association  of  Singapore,   which   is

published  in  full  in the Report  of  the  Select

Committee before you. The Select Committee received

oral  evidence  from witnesses from  the  Singapore

Rugby    Union,   the   Singapore   Table    Tennis

Association, and the Singapore Olympic  and  Sports

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the National Sports Promotion Board is

being  formed,  I  am confident  that  the  correct

foundation has been laid for active and substantial

concern  for, and involvement of the public  sector

in,   the   development  of  sports  consciousness,

activity and standards in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Promotion Board is

comprehensively  being  provided  with  legislative

powers  to take on responsibility for the promotion

and  co-ordination of sports in the country. Sports

is  now being given proper national recognition and

the  Board should, with single-minded objective and

devotion, promote and propagate sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Bill, Government accepts the

importance  and  role of sports  and  the  need  to

provide  the National Sports Promotion  Board  with

sufficient  financial  capacity  in  this   regard,

besides  providing  for all  sports  facilities  in

Singapore by transferring them to the Board by this

Bill.  Government also undertakes to subsidise  the

Board with what it now costs the Government for the

maintenance  of  existing public sports  facilities

annually.  It has also been agreed in principle  to

assist the Board to meet its recurrent expenditure,

including financial grants to sports organisations,

to enable them to organise proper schemes for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



popularisation  and promotion of standards  in  the

various national sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We accept the position of sports as integral to

recreation and essential for leisure. We  encourage

sports  in  all their variety, as such pastime  for

our people helps them to occupy their time usefully

as  players  or  supporters  of  sports,  and  also

accelerates  our process of social integration  and

nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Promotion Board will have

much to do and will need the active co-operation of

all  institutions and individuals with interest  in

or potential for contribution to the development of

sports   in  Singapore.  With  proper  schemes   of

research,  training and programmes of  regular  and

competitive  activity  organised  for  the  various

sports   in  Singapore  and  with  our  essentially

youthful  population, there is  no  reason  why  we

should   not  see  in  the  foreseeable  future   a

renaissance  in sports in Singapore,  evidenced  by

increasing  sports activity, matched  by  improving

standards and performances by our sportsmen in  the

local  and international sports scene. However,  it

will  take  some  time for the  Board  to  organise

properly  these  requirements, and  we  should  not

expect too much too soon and be disappointed  by  a

lack   of  outstanding  results  in  the  immediate

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Promotion Board will be

functional  in  the very near future  and  will  be

housed  in  the  Farrer Park Sports Centre,  to  be

known  as Sports House, which will become the focal

point  of sports personalities and activities.  The

offices  of  the  newly-formed  Singapore  National

Olympic  Sports  Council and of the 36  controlling

bodies of national sports will also be situated  in

Sports  House, and the various programmes of sports

activity will be considered and carried out in that

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the acceptance of the National Sports Promotion Board Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar in all respects to the Statute Law

Revision Act, 1969, the Bill now before this  House

also  seeks to amend and repeal a number of statute

laws   as   recommended   by   the   Law   Revision

Commissioners who are presently preparing a revised

edition of our Acts. `The amendments and repeals to

be made under the Bill are set out in the First and

Second  Schedules thereto and will be given  effect

by clauses 2 and 3 thereof respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the First Schedule to the Bill, each amendment

is  aimed at adapting a statute to some change that

has  taken place since it was enacted for  removing

an  obsolete  provision or incorrect reference.  It

will not, however, change the substance of the  law

but  will  merely  ensure  that  the  law  has  the

operation and effect originally intended for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in the Mental Disorders and

Treatment  Ordinance (Cap. 145)  will  adjust  some

references  in  the  Ordinance so  that  they  will

conform  with  the  amendments that  were  made  to

sections  32  and 34 of the Ordinance in  1957  and

1960 and an obsolete form is removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in the Rubber Estates Assessment

Ordinance (Cap. 168) are to conform to the  present

Constitution of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Price Control Ordinance (Cap. 225) is amended

to  conform  to the more recent Hire-Purchase  Act,

1969 (No. 1 of 1969).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seamen's Registry Board Ordinance, 1957 (No.

11 of 1957), will be made to refer correctly to the

present means of declaring a port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes

Registration Ordinance, 1959 (No. 5 of 1959), which

was passed when there were local authorities of the

City  Council and the Rural Board, will be  adapted

to  the  integrated health administration  we  have

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cross-reference in the Moneylenders Ordinance,

1959  (No. 58 of 1959), is corrected to conform  to

an amendment made to the Ordinance in 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the Income Tax Ordinance (Reprint 16

of  1966)  some cross-references were  adjusted  in

view of the amendments made in that year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Estate Duty Ordinance (Reprint 17 of 1966)

the  rate  of  interest on unpaid duty  for  deaths

occurring  before 1965, which was fixed by  section

32  of  the Ordinance in the 1955 edition, will  be

placed in the Fifth Schedule of the Ordinance along

with the rates for deaths in and after 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the last amendment in the Bill the form

prescribed  in  the  Hire-Purchase  Act,  1969,  is

altered to conform to the substantive provisions of

the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Schedule to the Bill lists a number of

enactments which will be repealed. The first column

shows  the  number and year of the  enactment.  Its

Short Title is given in the second column, and  the

third column shows how much of it will be repealed.

In  most cases, the whole statute or so much of  it

as   has  not  yet  previously  been  repealed   is

specified.  In  every case, the  enactment  is  now

obsolete  for one reason or another. Some of  these

laws   have   been   superseded  by   more   recent

legislation but were not repealed at the time. Some

have  outlived  their  original  purpose,  such  as

dealing  with public loans or with some  aspect  of

early   post-war   conditions   of   the   colonial

administration  in  Singapore. Some  are  Malaysian

laws  which have never been brought into  operation

in Singapore, or which can have no useful operation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



now,   or  in  respect  of  which  there  are  more

appropriate Singapore-enacted laws, and  some  were

intended to operate only for a transitional  period

and  are  no longer needed now. For one or more  of

these  reasons,  each enactment  contained  in  the

Second  Schedule  can be removed from  the  statute

book without affecting any administrative processes

or any person's rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments affected by the Bill will be

incorporated  in  the  revised  edition   of   Acts

publication  of which will commence soon,  and  the

repealed  enactments  will  be  omitted  from   the

edition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the other enactments in the Second

Schedule  to  the Bill, this Ordinance is  obsolete

since  the  payments  it  required  are  no  longer

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the

licensing and control of sand and granite quarries.

The  Sand Quarries Ordinance, 1961 (No. 33 of 1961)

is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



be  repealed.  At the moment, whilst sand  quarries

are licensed, granite quarries are not. This is  an

obviously  anomalous  position  which  it  is   now

proposed to put right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granite quarrying is a major operation involving,

amongst  other  things, the use of  explosives  and

heavy  plant and equipment. Further, granite is  an

important   building  material  to   the   building

industry  which is rapidly expanding in  Singapore.

There  is,  therefore, a pressing need for  granite

quarries   to  be  licensed  and  their  activities

brought  under  proper control. The control  is  to

ensure that there will be proper supervision of the

use  of  mechanically accepted plant and  equipment

for quarrying operations, as well as the imposition

of adequate safety measures to prevent any nuisance

or  danger or damage to life or property.  This  is

laid  down  in clause 13. As such, the penalty  for

the offence of operating a quarry without a licence

has been increased from the existing fine of $1,000

with  a continuing fine of not more than $50 a  day

provided  under the Sand Quarries Ordinance,  1961,

to  a maximum fine of $5,000 with a continuing fine

of $100 a day. This is provided for in clause 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill, in the main, follow

the   provisions  Sand  Quarries  Ordinance   which

repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker.

Sir, I rise to support the introduction of the Sand

and  Granite Quarries Bill the purpose of which has

been  explained  by the Minister. However,  I  must

express my regret and disappointment that there are

no  provisions  to  protect the  life,  health  and

safety  of  the workers. There is little on  safety

except  in  clause 13. Clause 13 (1)  is  concerned

with mechanical safety, and clause 13 (2) seems  to

be mainly concerned with the danger of blasting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



injuries. There is no mention of precautions to  be

taken  against  the great danger  of  silicosis  to

workers.  I  understand  that  silicosis   can   he

controlled  by (a) the use of exhaust  ventilation,

and (b) the use of wetting methods, and (c) the use

of  respirators. I hope regulations will be made by

the Minister for the purpose of ensuring the health

and safety of people working in granite quarries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe some studies have been made in the past

regarding  the occurrence of silicosis  in  granite

quarries.  I  understand that a study  made  of  40

workers  of an original group of 62 men  and  women

attending Medical Unit II. Silicosis Clinic. Outram

Road General Hospital, since 1955 was reviewed  for

morbidity.  It was found that (a) the incidence  of

silicosis  had increased by 16 per cent from  80.69

per  cent  in  1955 to 96.7 per cent in  1968;  (b)

silico-tuberculosis  had increased  from  24.2  per

cent  to  43.7 per cent: (c) the highest  mortality

and  morbidity  rates were seen among crusher-stone

truckers, crusher feeders and driers; (d) resistant

pulmonary  tuberculosis and pneumothorax  were  the

main causes of death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the authorities will look into the dangers

that  are prevalent in granite quarries, and I hope

the  Minister  will assure the House that  he  will

introduce more comprehensive legislation,  such  as

is  found  in the United Kingdom Mines and Quarries

Act  of  1954.  Will the Minister also  assure  the

House  that the P.W.D, has the necessary  personnel

to  administer satisfactorily the safety provisions

in  the Bill? In the past, the Factory Inspectorate

in  the Ministry of Labour could not manage  to  do

so, so much so that many granite quarry workers  in

Singapore   suffer  from  some  form  of  pulmonary

disease.  However,  since the Factory  Inspectorate

will  be strengthened considerably I have a written

assurance from the Ministry of Labour that it  will

be  so  -  will  the Minister designate  the  Chief

Inspector of Factories to be the Licensing  Officer

referred  to  in  clause 3 of the Bill,  with  tile

courtesy anti agreement of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



Minister for Labour of course? I consider  such  an

arrangement    possible   because    the    Factory

Inspectorate   administers   the   general   safety

provisions in quarries. I prefer to concentrate the

administration   of   safety  provisions   in   one

authority   rather  than  in  several  departments.

otherwise  they might run their affairs  at  cross-purposes  and cancel one another's efforts  because

of varying departmental attitudes and policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would propose that the Licensing

Officer   should  be  obliged  to  refer   to   the

Industrial  Health Unit of the Ministry  of  Health

before  a  quarry is licensed to ensure that  there

are  adequate provisions to protect the  health  of

workers and the general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to suggest that the Minister should

impress  upon  his  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Labour,  to  include  silicosis  as  a  compensable

disease under the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wind up my speech, I would like to quote from

an  International  Labour Organisation  publication

called  The Prevention and Suppression of  Dust  in

Mining, Tunnelling and Quarrying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From the medical aspect, no satisfactory answer

has been found either in the field of therapy, and,

although  research is being more and more  actively

pursued  into such matters, it seems unlikely  that

new  findings in these fields are being made  which

could  lead  to a victory over the two occupational

diseases mentioned (silicosis and pneumonoconiosis)

in  the  near  future. In the light of  present-day

knowledge  it  cannot  be  doubted  that  the  most

fruitful  methods for combating the  dust  diseases

are   to  be  found  among  those  which  rely   on

preventing  the  formation of dust in  the  various

mining operations or upon suppressing it at, or  as

near as possible to, its source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those countries which were first to recognise

the  health hazard of airborne dust and which  made

provision  for  the introduction of dust-preventive

measures  and regular medical examination supported

by suitable legislation,



<br><br>So  I  would  like to appeal to the Minister  again

that  he  should  consider introducing  legislation

similar  to  the United Kingdom Mines and  Quarries

Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue with the quotation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- and where the compulsory payment of compensation

for  miners who contracted silicosis encouraged the

application of such measures, -`



<br><br>Here,  I would like to appeal to the Minister again

to  urge his colleague, the Minister for Labour, to

make  silicosis a notifiable disease - it is so  in

the  Factories  Ordinance  -  and  to  make  it   a

compensable  disease in the Workmen's  Compensation

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continue with the quotation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- the statistics show without doubt that great

advances have been made both in the health  of  the

underground workers and in working conditions found

in the mines.'



<br><br>5.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I feel that the introduction of this Bill  at

this  juncture  is  most  appropriate  because  the

building  industry  has been growing  very  rapidly

recently. The Government and the private sector are

both  engaged  in  the construction  of  buildings.

Furthermore, the network of roads is being extended

continuously. This means that the use of  sand  and

granite is increasing every day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides for the licensing and control

of  sand  and granite quarries with provisions  for

safety  measures.  Without these  safety  measures,

workers  may  be injured or killed,  thus  bringing

misery  to  their families. So the introduction  of

this Bill should be welcomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that with the

implementation  of  the Bill, the  revenue  of  our

country  will also be increased and it  will  be  a

great help to our country financially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Kallang spoke at great

length on how workers should be safeguarded against

accidents.  I feel that people working in  quarries

are  risking  their  lives.  So  if  there  are  no

adequate  safety  measures  in  the  quarries,  the

workers are liable to be injured. This Bill  merits

the support of all Members of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that there should be regulations to

implement this Bill so that the objectives  can  be

achieved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Bill has not as yet been

passed and Members are telling me what to put  into

the  regulations! I wonder whether they are jumping

the  gun, as it were, or barking up the wrong tree,

telling me to induce my colleague, the Minister for

Labour, to do this, that and the other. Suffice  it

to say that we had no Ordinance before. We now have

a Bill which is really necessary and perhaps should

have  been introduced some time ago to control  the

operations  of  sand and granite quarry  operators.

Regulations  will be passed. What these regulations

will  be  will  depend really on the conditions  of

work  in  the quarries. I doubt whether the figures

cited by one Member in respect of silicosis can  be

confined  merely  to  granite  quarries.   He   has

mentioned  the  United Kingdom Mines  and  Quarries

Act.  But  surely conditions in the United  Kingdom

are different. Working in coal mines underground is

entirely different from working in granite quarries

above the ground. Whether or not it should be  made

compulsory for granite quarry operators to  provide

their  workers with respiratory masks  will  really

depend on the conditions in the quarries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to the Members for giving their

support  to  this Bill and drawing my attention  to

certain  aspects  of  it which  might  have  to  be

improved  and  amendments passed in the  future.  I

give  the  Members my assurance that if  the  facts

back  up  an amendment, we will amend the Bill.  If

the matters complained of deserve the support which

the  two Members think they do, they will he looked

into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestion that the Licensing Officer

should be one man and not two, I am afraid I cannot

give that assurance here. This matter will have  to

be  gone  into and I will have to ascertain whether

or  not  the  Member is correct when he  says  that

there should be one man.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  know  who is trying to fool whom. I understand

that  granite  quarries are  now  being  registered

under section 6 of the Factories Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



because  a granite quarry is regarded as a  factory

which is involved in the process of "breaking up an

article".



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Abdul Aziz, I presume you are

trying to clarify?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Yes, Sir,I have had some

correspondence   with  the   Chief   Inspector   of

Factories and he gave me the impression that he  is

the  authority who registers granite quarries. With

the  introduction of the Sand and Granite  Quarries

Bill  and if it becomes law, the licensing of  sand

and  granite quarries will be done by the  Director

of  Public  Works  or somebody in the  Ministry  of

National  Development. I am wondering  whether  the

Chief  Inspector of Factories will be carrying  out

certain  functions.  Can  the  Minister  give  some

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> They are two different Ordinances

administered by two different persons.  The  Member

should,  in  fact, be happier that we are  catching

granite  quarries, as it were, under  two  separate

Ordinances. The Factories Ordinance imposes certain

conditions   and  regulations.  This   is   another

Ordinance.  But surely they can work  together.  Is

the Member unhappy that this Bill is being passed?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I have

said that I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Abdul Aziz, I think I have

allowed you a lot of latitude.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, I am not against the

Bill. But it is not comprehensive enough, it should

be similar to the United Kingdom Mines and Quarries

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Barker.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore now stands in the 151st year of its

foundation.  We have achieved much since  the  days

when  the island was largely jungle and swamp land.

Both  low-cost  and luxury buildings rise  skywards

and  hundreds of acres are being reclaimed from the

sea.  The  vitality of our citizens, our desire  to

demonstrate  that  the world  does  not  owe  us  a

living,   our   rapid   industrial   and   economic

advancement  and  other  factors  have  contributed

towards a surge of progress in the last decade, the

like  of  which  Singapore  has  not  seen  in  its

previous history. In this forward-looking state  of

mind  and  in our enthusiasm for urban renewal,  we

may  wake up one day to find our historic monuments

either  bulldozed  or  crumbling  to  dust  through

neglect. As new Singapore is being built,  we  must

not  let  the  worthwhile part of  older  Singapore

disappear, and the time has therefore come  for  us

to  take stock of what we have of the past and seek

to  preserve objects and buildings that will remind

us of our heritage, even though it be short in span

of time. It is to this end that the Preservation of

Monuments Bill is now before this House. This piece

of  legislation will, we hope, assist in preserving

for  the  benefit  of  our  future  the  buildings,

monuments and sites that have been associated  with

people, events and periods in our history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of monuments already in full

use,  and  the Preservation of Monuments Bill  will

not  in  any way detract from such use. The  multi-racial composition of Singapore has given us a rich

and  varied  number of monuments  which  will  come

within  the  purview of this Bill. These  monuments

will be specified in preservation orders to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



be  made  by  the  Minister on the  advice  of  the

Preservation of Monuments Board which is to be  set

up  in order to carry out the task of marking  out,

preserving  and maintaining monuments. The  members

of  the Board will be drawn from many walks of life

and  from all spheres of activity, but will all  be

united in the purpose of conserving our "monuments"

an expression which is defined in the Bill as those

which     are     of     "historic,    traditional,

archaeological,    architectural    or     artistic

interest".  The Board is charged with the  task  of

augmenting   the  amenities  o, these   monuments,

stimulating  public  interest  and  preserving  all

records,  documents  and  data  relating  to   such

monuments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the powers which are to be conferred on the

Board  are  the  powers to advise on and  supervise

alterations  and renovations to the  monuments:  to

contribute by means of a grant or loan towards  the

expenses incurred in the upkeep and preservation of

monuments;  to acquire any land, site  or  monument

appearing  to  tile  Board  to  be  of  outstanding

historic, traditional or artistic interest; and  to

regulate and control public access to monuments and

to charge fees for such access.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains an interesting provision for

the  saving  of  monuments which  are  occupied  as

dwelling  houses. If within the period of one  year

from  the  date  of  the  preservation  order   the

monument is not acquired under the Land Acquisition

Act,  1966, the preservation order is to  cease  to

have effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word on these preservation orders will not be

amiss.  The  Minister will notify  in  the  Gazette

preservation  orders  which he  will  make  on  the

advice of the Board placing the specified monuments

under  the  Board's  protection.  A  copy  of   the

preservation order will be served upon the owner or

occupier of the "monument" as defined in the  Bill.

A  preservation  order  will  bind  all  subsequent

owners  and  occupiers of the  land  on  which  the

monument is sited and will operate as if it were  a

charge on the land. Where a preservation order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



is  in  force,  the  monument to  which  the  order

relates may not, without the consent of the  Board,

be demolished, removed or altered in any way except

in the case of urgent necessity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the Board in carrying out its objects,

a fund to he known as the Preservation of Monuments

Fund is to be established and it is hoped that  the

public will respond generously by making donations,

grants and gifts to this Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.





<br><br>5.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  Bill deserves our support,  because  it

seeks to preserve all the historical monuments  for

the  benefit of our future generations. The history

of our nation is very short. If we count from 1819,

we have a short history of 150 years. Last year, we

celebrated   our   150th  anniversary.   The   main

objective  of  this  Bill is to  preserve  all  the

worthwhile relics and monuments for the benefit  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, our Prime Minister went on a tour of

various countries. We read from the newspapers that

when he visited Russia, he went to pay his respects

to a heroic and grand monument at Leningrad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have many memorable monuments

and relics. At Lavender Street, there is a building

called  Chau Chia Kuan. It is dated 1819. In  other

words,  it  has a history of more than  150  years.

This  building -should be preserved by us. We  know

that  there is a temple named Siang Lim Sze at  Toa

Payoh.  Siang  Lim  Temple is  also  a  very  grand

monument.  All these monuments should be  preserved

for  the benefit of our future generation. They are

attractions to tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain provisions in the Bill which

lay  down that any land, site or monument which has

a historical interest will be preserved and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



Government will assist in its preservation. This is

a  very  enlightened move. I hope that  the  public

will be given the opportunity to participate in the

work of preserving our historical monuments. Civic-minded  people should be involved in this work.  In

other  words, they should be invited to sit on  the

Board. After another 150 years, our people will  be

able  to know that these historical monuments  have

been preserved through the efforts of our Minister.

They   will   praise  him  for  his  foresight   in

preserving our historical relics.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> All I need say, Sir, is thanks to the

Member for his support.

the Order Paper Supplement*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The words appearing in the Order Paper Supplement read as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"land which is the site of the monument and

shall operate as if it were a charge on land,

whether that land is registered or

unregistered land. The preservation order

shall, --



<pre>

Ord. 21     (a) if it affects registered land, be regarded  as

of 1956.        a statutory obligation under  paragraph (c) of

Cap. 225        subsection (1)  of  section  28  of  the  Land

                Titles Ordinance, 1956; and



            (b) if  it affects unregistered land, be  regarded

                as if it were a charge under. the Registration

                of Deeds Ordinance and, upon registration of a

                memorandum  of  the  charge,  created  by  the

                preservation   order,   the   charge    shall,

                notwithstanding   the   provisions   of   that

                Ordinance,  have   priority   over  all  other

                instruments  (including  charges   and   other

                encumbrances) affecting that land.".

</pre>

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is to remove doubts as to the precise

effect  of  the land charge which is created  by  a

preservation  order,  particularly  as  it  affects

unregistered  land.  The most  effective  means  of

achieving  this is to treat the preservation  order

as  if  it were a charge under the Registration  of

Deeds   Ordinance   and  to  provide   that,   upon

registration  of a memorandum of the  charge,  such

charge   shall   have  priority  over   all   other

instruments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards registered land, the charge will have

effect  as a statutory obligation under section  28

(1)  (c)  of the Land Titles Ordinance, 1956.  This

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, I beg to move the motion

standing in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament resolves that the amendments

set out in Appendix I to the Report of the Standing

Orders Committee as contained in Paper Parl.  4  of

1970  be and are hereby made to the Standing Orders

of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the sitting of Parliament on the 27th

January   this  year,  a  resolution   was   passed

empowering  the Standing Orders Committee  of  this

House  to consider and report on any amendments  to

the   Standing  Orders  of  Parliament  which   the

Committee  may deem necessary. I am glad  to  state

that the Committee has submitted its Report to this

House  and has recommended that the amendments  set

out  in  Appendix 1 thereto be made to the  present

Standing Orders of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the principal amendments recommended

concerns  the  procedure for dealing  with  a  Bill

which  may  be  adversely  reported  upon  by   the

Presidential   Council.   Article   81K   of    the

Constitution, which came into operation early  this

year, provides with some exceptions for Bills which

have  been passed by this House to be sent  to  the

Presidential  Council  for  their  opinion  as   to

whether  or not any and, if so, which provision  of

the  Bill  would,  if enacted, be a differentiating

measure  or otherwise inconsistent with  the  funda

mental liberties of the subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Council submits an adverse report on a

Bill,  there are two courses which may be taken  if

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



enactment  of the Bill is to be pursued. Parliament

may  amend  the Bill after which the  Bill  in  its

amended form will be resubmitted to the Council; or

Parliament may, by an affirmative vote of not  less

than   two-thirds  of  the  total   membership   of

Parliament,  pass a resolution for the presentation

of the Bill to the President for his assent. It is,

therefore,  necessary for the procedure for  either

course  to be written into our Standing Orders  and

the  procedure  recommended by the Standing  Orders

Committee  is set out in the proposed new  Standing

Order at paragraph 20 of Appendix I to the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on financial procedure a recommendation has

been  made to increase the number of allotted  days

for  the consideration of the Main Estimates in the

Committee  of Supply from three days as at  present

to  five days. This should keep some Members happy.

In  the previous two Budget sessions the number  of

allotted  days  for  the  discussion  of  the  Main

Estimates  was, by resolution, increased  to  five.

And  on both occasions all the five days were taken

up.  There  is justification, therefore,  for  this

increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Development Estimates, the

Committee  has also recommended that the number  of

allotted  days  for  the  Committee  of  Supply  be

increased from one to two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, you will recollect that at the last Budget session a good number of amendments to the Estimates tabled by Members were not reached by want of time. The Committee, therefore, gave some thought to this and has suggested that the time limit for speeches in the Committee of Supply be

reduced  from the present 15 minutes to 10  minutes

at  any one time. The number of times a Member  may

speak   on   any   question,  of  course,   remains

unlimited,  it is hoped that this will enable  more

Members  to have an opportunity to speak and  raise

matters relating to the Estimates and other matters

considered in the Committee of Supply. I might  add

that in the Australian House of `Representatives a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



Member is allowed two periods each not exceeding 10

minutes  on each question in Committee; a total  of

20 minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At paragraph 27 of Appendix 1to the Committee's

Report  is  a  new Standing Order setting  out  the

procedure  for a Vote of Credit for which provision

had  been  made in an amendment to the Constitution

in 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, 1 would like to refer to

the  proposed amendment relating to a debate on the

Motion  for  the  Adjournment. At  present  if  the

adjournment  is moved at 8.00 p.m., the Adjournment

Debate can go on to 8.30 p.m., that is to say,  for

30  minutes. However, if the adjournment  is  moved

at,  say, 7.00 p.m., the debate can go on till 8.30

p.m., i.e., for  l½ hours. It  is  felt  that  30

minutes  should be sufficient time for such debate.

If  the proposed amendment to Standing Order 1  (8)

(b) as recommended in Appendix I to the Committee's

Report'  is  accepted,  a  uniform  maximum  of  30

minutes  will  be  available for a  debate  on  the

Motion for the Adjournment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament resolves that the amendments

set out in Appendix I to the Report of the Standing

motion standing in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4   of  the  Foreshores  Ordinance  (Chapter  246),

approves  the  reclamation by Government  of  those

portions  of  the  fore-shore and tidal  swamps  at

Loyang containing a total area of approximately 205

acres   as   shown   coloured   pink   and   yellow

respectively  on  the  plan  marked  "LAND   OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/1970" which is deposited  in

the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Jurong Town Corporation proposes to

develop  the area shown edged in black on the  plan

marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/1970". A

copy  of  this plan is displayed in the Library  of

this  House  for  the information of  Members.  The

proposed development is a Marine Industrial  Estate

to  provide bases for oil exploration and  drilling

concerns and other allied industries which are both

labour  and capital intensive. Loyang is considered

eminently  suitable  by these  concerns  for  their

South China Sea operations, whilst additional bases

to  be  established at Jurong will cater for  their

operations elsewhere in the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area affected by the proposed development,

totalling  about 467 acres, comprises state  lands.

War  Department lands, private lands and  parts  of

the foreshore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements are being made to transfer the War

Department  lands  to the Singapore  Government  to

enable  them  to  he alienated to the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  together  with the  state  lands.  The

private  lands, lots 291 and 292, will be  acquired

for the proposed development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this development necessitates the prior

reclamation  of  portions  of  the  foreshore,  the

existing  river, Sungei Selarang, and other  swampy

areas which are subject to tidal influence as shown

coloured  pink and yellow respectively on the  plan

totalling about 205 acres in area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation cost of about $1,300,000 will be

borne  by  the  Jurong  Town Corporation  which  is

undertaking  this work as agent of the  Government.

The hilly parts within the proposed development lay-out   will   provide  sufficient  fill   for   this

reclamation  which is expected to be  completed  in

about a year's time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4   of  the  Foreshores  Ordinance  (Chapter  246),

approves the reclamation by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RESETTLEMENT PROBLEMS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

Singapore is faced with two major problems, namely,

urbanisation and industrialisation. In the process,

they    inevitably   involve   the   question    of

resettlement. Resettlement problems usually involve

the  human  factor. Hence, many episodes  of  human

interest  have occurred. My constituency  has  been

selected   as   the  major  area   for   industrial

development and, therefore, many of my constituents

are  affected by resettlement. If I do not  mention

in  this House some of the problems arising out  of

resettlement of some villages, I will be failing in

my duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not deny that resettlement is a thorny problem. It is not just a matter of cutting down fruit trees and dismantling of houses. It also involves the removal of the people and their livestock to another place. This, of course, affects the normal life of the people.

Most  of the farmers have built up their homesteads

after many long years of effort. For them to remove

elsewhere is, of course, not easy. It is a  painful

matter to them. During all these years, our farmers

have shown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



great understanding and have co-operated fully with

the Government. Within the stipulated deadline they

have bravely put up with great inconveniences. They

have parted for good from the homesteads which they

have  built up through toil and labour.  They  have

gone  to the resettlement areas where they have  to

start everything afresh. In my opinion, since  they

have  been  very co-operative with the  Government.

The Government departments concerned should not let

them  have  the  worst of it. They should  adopt  a

sympathetic attitude towards them and,  as  far  as

possible,   try   to   lessen   their   pain    and

inconvenience. Every assistance should be given  to

them  to resume their normal livelihood within  the

shortest  possible time after they have removed  to

the resettlement areas. Otherwise the burden of our

industrialisation programme will fall  mainly  upon

them. This is not fair to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the authorities concerned seem to have much

leeway  in  respect  of  the  time  limit  set  for

development  of  the delineated  areas.  Sometimes,

certain  areas  may he designated  for  development

soon.  But  after several years of waiting  by  the

farmers, nothing happens. As a result, the affected

farmers are in a quandary. The roads in their areas

deteriorate  and are never properly repaired.  They

are  also notified by the authorities not to  carry

on with their agricultural activities. On the other

hand, the period of waiting sometimes turns out  to

be  two  or three years. During this waiting period

the farmers generally dare not undertake any large-scale  planting  of  fruit  trees  or  rearing   of

livestock. Thus, their income is reduced  and  they

have  to  make  use of their savings  in  order  to

survive.  This kind of life is most intolerable  to

them.  I  hope the authorities concerned will  give

them a definite date for their removal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Jurong Constituency is a developing area. Some parts are already developed. Sometimes, in implementing the development plans, the authorities will choke up the drains, thus causing frequent flooding of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



vegetable  gardens  in the surrounding  areas.  For

example,  in  my  constituency  around  Kian   Teck

Village  and  Chung  Keng Pah, such  incidents  did

happen.  In  order to avoid any losses the  farmers

have  reduced their cultivation. Some have gone  to

look  for jobs in the Jurong industrial area so  as

to  supplement their income from farming.  Some  of

them have failed in their agricultural pursuits  as

a  result  of  an  epidemic in livestock.  As  they

cannot  for  the time being secure enough  capital,

they  have  to look for some jobs in the industrial

area in order to maintain their livelihood. The net

result  is  that,  after  one  or  two  years,  the

authorities  will conduct a census  and  when  they

find  that  the farmers' cultivation has  decreased

and  that someone in the household has gone out  to

do  some  odd job, they will transfer the  original

farming  household to the register of  non-farmers.

Moreover,  these people will not be considered  for

the  allocation of farm lots. These villagers  live

partly  by  agriculture and partly by  other  work.

When  they  are required to remove, the  lucky  one

will be allotted some 3,000 square feet of land  to

build a house and some will have to go and live  in

HDB/JTC  flats.  Their new living space  is  small.

Hence,  they have no more opportunity to engage  in

agricultural activities. If they go and work in the

industrial   area,  they  have   to   travel   long

distances,   and   this  means   an   increase   in

expenditure.  They will, therefore,  lead  an  even

poorer   life.   The   Government   should    allot

agricultural lands to these farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the villages, the family unit system is still prevalent. Sometimes, on a piece of land on Temporary Occupation Licence, there may be several households, some on a father-and-son relationship, some on a brother-and-brother relationship, and others are just relatives. Several of the households may be separate and

independent.  However, when allocating  lands,  the

authorities  in  charge will  not  take  this  into

consideration. For one T.O.L., only  one  piece  of

land will be allotted to the licensee, irrespective

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



how many households there are on that piece of land

at the moment. It has happened that sometimes 30 to

40  people are resettled on a small piece of  land.

But what is even worse is that the authorities have

stipulated  that  only one dwelling  house  can  be

built  on  one piece of allotted land. Furthermore,

these  dwelling houses are not permitted to have  a

building  area of more than 1,000 square  feet.  It

requires little imagination to visualise the  over-crowding and inconvenience when 30 to 40 people are

crammed  into  a  house  of 1,000  square  feet.  I

suggest  that,  to be reasonable, each  independent

household  should be allotted a separate  piece  of

land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Government resettles the farmers, they will receive compensation for having to give up their dwelling houses, pigsties, chicken sheds and fruit trees, etc. However, the rate of compensation is very low. It is usually not enough to build a new house. I have no intention to

argue   with   the  Minister  on  the   amount   of

compensation. However, there are two points in this

connection  which are considered most unreasonable.

The first relates to the stipulation of the maximum

compensation. According to it, the compensation for

an  acre  of  fruit  trees and other  crops  cannot

exceed  $1,500. To a diligent farmer this is simply

a  kind of exploitation. It must be understood that

these fruit trees and crops are the result of  long

years  of toil on the part of the farmers. How  can

they  not  be  compensated with a  fair  amount  on

resettlement?  The  other  point  relates  to   the

compensation  for the house. This is based  on  the

size  of  the cemented area. It is also  stipulated

that,  subject  to  the possession  of  documentary

evidence  to  show that the house was built  before

the  Second World War, or the plans of their  house

if  built  after  the  war, every  square  foot  of

cemented  land is to be compensated for  at  $2.50.

Otherwise,  the  compensation is $1.  Sir,  in  the

rural areas many attap houses had been in existence

before  the war. However, the rural folks  did  not

know very much about the cumbersome procedures of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



the  Government. So they did not prepare  plans  to

apply  for house numbers. As a result, many farmers

whose houses were actually put up before the war or

were  built more than ten years ago had to  settle,

willy-nilly,  for a much lower rate of compensation

because  they could not produce documents or  plans

to   prove  such  facts.  In  such  cases,  it   is

reasonable to accept their claims as true, provided

the  village leaders can confirm them and  provided

they are countersigned or confirmed by a Member  of

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers affected by the scheme are usually

resettled at far-away places. But this is not  all.

The  worst of it is that they cannot rebuild  their

homesteads immediately. Some of them are  allocated

low-living  areas where they have to spend  several

thousand dollars of their own money to fill up  the

land. Some have been resettled in places where  the

original  dwellers are still staying, and this  has

caused even more trouble. This has happened because

the officers who plan such resettlement merely stay

in their air-conditioned rooms and have not gone to

the spot to see the actual situation of the farmers

for  themselves. Sometimes the dwelling houses, the

chicken  sheds or pigsties of the original dwellers

happen  to appear on the demarcation lines or  have

been  given  to others, thus putting  the  original

dwellers  in a dilemma. It has often happened  that

before  the compensation for the affected  property

of the original dwellers has been properly settled,

the  same  land is allocated to new settlers,  thus

causing no end of confusion to the old and the  new

dwellers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what troubles the farmers in the resettlement areas even more is that when they have been resettled in a place for not more than a few years, they are requested to remove to another place. In every removal they will incur great losses and suffer inconvenience. I am against this

moving  from place to place. This puts the  farmers

in  a  very  distressing and helpless position.  At

times after they have been resettled they will, all

of  a  sudden, receive a notice saying  that  their

pigsties and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



chicken  sheds will have to be demolished in  order

to  make  way for the building of a new road.  They

have  to  pull down the structures which they  have

put  up. This upsets them very much. All this  goes

to  show that there has not been prior planning  in

resettlement.  Moreover, the resettlement  problems

have not been considered carefully in advance. Many

farmers  have  been  asked to resettle  on  another

occasion, causing great losses and inconvenience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to request the Minister to study for

himself  the  plans for resettlement so  that  such

things do not happen again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to another matter. Many rural people

are  religious  and there are many temples  in  the

areas   affected  by  resettlement.  In   the   new

resettlement areas, there is no provision  of  land

for   the   building   of  temples.   Some   temple

managements,  after lengthy negotiations  with  the

authorities,  were fortunate enough  to  get  small

plots  of  land  allotted to them. To  these  rural

people, religion is a part of their lives, and this

lack of land is most inconvenient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what amazes me is that no reservation

has  been  made  for sites in the new  resettlement

areas  for  educational  purposes.  Many  resettled

farmers have been troubled by the problem of  their

children's  education.  The Government  should  not

think   that  once  the  farmers  are  successfully

resettled,  the  undertaking is completed  and  the

livelihood,  education, recreation,  etc.,  of  the

farmers  can  be  disregarded. I assert  that  this

attitude is not correct. In Resettlement Areas  117

and  118  the  situation is thus. The  settlers  in

these  two  resettlement  areas  came  mainly  from

Lokyang  Village in my constituency. The Management

Committee  of Lokyang School, which was  originally

in  Lokyang  Village were notified that the  school

would   be   demolished.  They   applied   to   the

authorities for a lot in the resettlement area  and

made  preparations  to remove  to  the  new  school

building.  At the same time, local keen  supporters

of  the  cause of education also set  up  a  school

building   committee.  But  this   enthusiasm   for

education on the part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



the  villagers  did not meet with any encouragement

from  the  Government. They did not  even  allot  a

piece  of  land for a school. The schools near  the

resettlement area already have a full enrolment and

settlers  are  continually  being  added   to   the

settlement. I really do not know where the children

of  these  settlers will go for their schooling.  I

request   the   Minister  to  give  the   House   a

satisfactory answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present farmers who are not yet affected

by  resettlement have two to three acres of land on

an   average   which   is  used  for   agricultural

cultivation  or  livestock rearing  or  both.  They

mobilize  all hands in the family and  utilize  all

the  available  land. In this way, they  manage  to

scrape  up three meals a day. When they are removed

to  the  resettlement areas, they are allotted  not

more  than  one and a half acres of land.  A  great

majority  of  the households get only  one-half  or

three-quarters of an acre of land. When the area of

arable land is reduced, the amount harvested  will,

of  course,  be  reduced proportionately.  Further,

there  will  not be a harvest rightaway.  If  fruit

trees  are planted, it will take several years  for

them  to  bear  fruit.  If the  income  from  their

agricultural activities is not enough  to  maintain

their  livelihood, members of the family seek  work

in the industrial areas. Then, in view of the great

distances   travelled,  after  deducting  transport

expenses,  the income received will still  be  very

limited. The farmers who are resettled not only get

a   reduced   income  but  also   incur   increased

expenditure.  Because a house is  newly  built,  it

will attract a higher annual assessment value.  The

property  tax  is thereby increased. To  settle  in

some  far-away place, the farmers have to pay  more

on transport expenses than before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, sanitary amenities will have to be

installed, hygienic pigsties and chicken sheds have

to be built, better breeds of livestock and farming

implements have to be bought. All these need money.

When  the  school nearby is full up,  the  children

will have to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



sent  to  far-away places for schooling,  and  more

transport expenses will be incurred. It can be said

that  the  farmers,  who are  already  poor,  after

moving  to the resettlement area, will become  even

poorer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ours is a country which professes democratic

socialism  and advocates the narrowing of  the  gap

between  the  rich and the poor. Judging  from  the

distressed   condition   of   dwellers    in    the

resettlement  areas, the gap between the  rich  and

the  poor has grown wider. The Government seems not

to  care  for the farmers. It seems to be satisfied

with merely rapidly removing the farmers from their

homesteads and allotting the sites thus vacated  to

foreign capitalists for investment. The authorities

concerned  seem not to have planned  and  developed

the  resettlement areas well to make them  suitable

for   people  to  live  in  and  enjoy  the  modern

amenities   of  life.  The  Government   has   been

vociferous  in  claiming that it is much  concerned

with  the welfare of the resettlement dwellers.  It

should not merely pay lip-service to it, but should

show its concern for them in practical terms.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, regarding the problems mentioned  at

length by the Member for Jurong, my feeling is that

they are general resettlement problems and only one

or  two  deserve  an answer. All the  rest  can  be

solved    administratively   by   the   departments

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to data collected by the Primary

Production Department, there are about 19,000 farms

which  have  been  licensed. The number  of  people

engaged in farming is about 180,000, of which those

who  are  engaged in full-time farming number  only

36,000,  those engaged in part-time farming  number

14,000,  and  those not engaged in  farming  number

23,000.  The  rest are women and  children.  If  we

classify  the farms according to their  sizes,  the

small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



farms  comprise  about 85 per cent. The rest are medium-sized  farms.  By  small

farms I mean those which have less than 100 pigs or less than 1,000chickens,  or

farms  which are partly engaged in other farming activities. According to  these

data,  most  of the farmers on the small farms are part-time farmers.  Meantime,

they  are  also  engaged in other activities to maintain  their  livelihood.  As

regards  these  small farmers, whether or not they are affected by resettlement,

they are still part-time farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has alleged that these farmers have become poor because

of resettlement. This is incorrect. However, I do not deny that when a farmer is

resettled  in  a  new area, he will have to put up with some  inconvenience  and

hardship.  My  department understands very well the existence of these  problems

and  we have always given these farmers our careful attention. We have tried our

best to reduce their difficulties in building their new homesteads. This is  the

experience we have gathered over the years and, as a matter of fact, because  of

our  enlightened  and  reasonable  attitude  in  tackling  these  problems,  our

resettlement  policy  has been carried out smoothly. I do not  agree  completely

with  the  Member  for  Jurong  when  he says  that  in  the  implementation  of

resettlement,  certain aberrations exist. In point of fact, the selection  of  a

resettlement area is dependent on a number of factors. The most important factor

is  that  the  selected site must conform with the utilisation of  the  area  as

specified  by  the  Master Plan for Singapore. The majority of the  resettlement

areas  are delineated in the Lim Chu Kang and Choa Chu Kang areas. That  is  the

reason why farmers from Jurong must be resettled in these areas. But what  I  am

worried  about is that once we have used up these areas, we have to  review  the

policy of reallocation of land for farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also alleged that certain farmers were resettled for

a  second  time. These are the facts. When we were in Malaysia, the  problem  of

national defence was in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



the  hands  of  the  central  Government. When we became  independent,  national

defence became our primary concern. En order to train our Army, the Ministry  of

Defence  required  large areas of land for training purposes. Because  of  this,

certain rural areas, including certain resettlement areas, were affected by this

plan.  Actually,  resettlement  is  not an  easy  task.  Sometimes,  because  of

practical  necessity,  we  are  compelled to carry  out  resettlement.  Strictly

speaking,  our resettlement department can be said to be an agency  for  various

Government departments in clearing out areas designated for development so  that

all  our  national development projects may be carried out smoothly. If one  day

there  is  nothing for the resettlement department to do, then  our  development

will also come to a stop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong is unhappy about the reallocation of land for farmers

and  about the maximum compensation of $1,500 per acre of fruit trees.  Sir,  on

the  question of reallocation of land, our policy is this. If the  person  is  a

genuine farmer, he will get between half an acre and two acres of land. As  land

is   becoming  increasingly  scarce  in  our  country,  there  must  be  certain

limitations  imposed on our policy of reallocation of land. On the  question  of

the  maximum compensation of $1,500 per acre of fruit trees, this figure is much

higher than that prevailing before 1964. The maximum compensation is based  upon

the  maximum number of fruit trees which can be cultivated in an acre  of  land.

The  fixing  of  the maximum figure also ensures that corruption does  not  take

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in regard to compensation for buildings, if the owner can produce

documentary  evidence  to  show that he has followed  legitimate  procedures  in

applying  for  building approval, he will receive compensation at  the  rate  of

$2.50  per square foot. In addition, I wish to mention that special cases  which

were  brought before the relevant department by Members of Parliament have  been

given special consideration after due investigation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the problems of damage to roads, blocked drains and larger houses

for  farmers, all these problems can be solved administratively by  the  various

departments concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although our resettlement areas cannot be compared with those under the Housing and Development Board, at least most of them do have roads, drains and supplies of water and electricity. Furthermore, a certain portion of the resettlement area is set aside for schools and other purposes. However, the construction of schools is not the responsibility of the resettlement department. If the Ministry of Education can support the building

of  schools in the resettlement area, then our resettlement department  will  be

willing to offer assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of temples, those which were affected by resettlement projects

have been relocated in various resettlement areas. There are also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



community centres in these resettlement areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I wish to point out that for the last few years our

farmers, under the care of our Government, have made a considerable contribution

to our country. As a result of the rapid expansion of our economy and the growth

of  industrialisation, it is true that a certain number  of  farmers  have  been

affected by resettlement. But, on the whole, our farmers have contributed to our

Gross  National Product to the tune of 2.9 per cent. In terms of monetary value,

their annual production exceeds $100 million. This, then, is the fact which goes

to  show  that  the picture painted by the Member for Jurong is based  upon  his

subjective point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.
