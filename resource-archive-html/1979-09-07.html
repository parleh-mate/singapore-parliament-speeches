  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education if he can state the reasons why the University of Singapore discontinued its part-time evening undergraduate courses and whether the University will consider re-introducing them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font>

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering this question on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two part-time evening undergraduate degree courses were formerly offered by the University of Singapore. The Bachelor of Accountancy Course was started in 1965-66 and was discontinued with effect from 1969-70. The Bachelor of Laws Course was started in 1957-58 and was discontinued with effect from 1960-61.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part-time evening courses were discontinued because:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the drop-out rate was high;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the courses were uneconomical to conduct; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the recruitment of part-time teachers was difficult.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics on the part-time evening Accountancy and Law undergraduate courses are given in the Tables (Cols. 423 - 424) which have been circulated. Twenty-six candidates were admitted to the Bachelor of Accountancy course in 1965. Of these, only three completed the course in minimum time, and one completed the course in the seventh year. Three of the 84 candidates admitted to the LLB course in 1957 converted to the full-time course. Of the remaining 81, only 11 completed the course in minimum time, and one completed the course in the seventh year. Results in subsequent years were also discouraging.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University is planning to introduce a part-time evening course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Technology. The course is aimed at upgrading technological skills of persons in relevant employment, in particular, Engineering diploma holders of the Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Technical College. The University has no immediate plans to reintroduce part-time evening undergraduate courses in the other faculties.

   <b>TRANSFER OF HAWKER STALLS</b>
  </div>

  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for the Environment whether he will allow the transfer of hawker stalls for those hawkers who have moved to Housing and Development Board estates which are far away from their place of business, and who, for reasons of age, physical handicap and family responsibility, are faced with considerable hardship to maintain their present stalls.

  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Sir, the Sentosa Development Corporation has several plans to make Sentosa Island more attractive to both Singaporeans and the tourists.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to encourage the private sector to participate in the development of the Island. One such development is the construction of resort hotels of world class standard. Tenders for the hotel sites are being drawn up and will be called sometime this year. The Ministry of Trade and Industry is finalising the incentives to be given to the first one or two hotels.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second private development is the construction of a seafood restaurant on a kelong. Tenders for the sites have just been called.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty hectares of the northern foreshore of Sentosa are being reclaimed. When completed, the reclaimed land will form part of a site to be leased to the Sentosa Golf Club for the development of a second 18-hole golf course. This course will be of championship standards and will be suitable for the World Cup.

   <b>SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FUND</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, in view of the dissatisfaction of certain categories of employers at having to pay 2 per cent of monthly wage into a Skills Development Fund, if he will state the rationale of this levy, and why this contribution should be made by employers whose businesses do not require the use of skilled labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Sir, the Prime Minister, at the National Day Rally on 19th August, 1979, has explained fully the rationale for the Government's wage policy this year. Nevertheless, I would like to briefly restate the rationale in the context of the training cess and the Skills Development Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to upgrade and restructure our economy promptly, if our economy is to continue to grow at 8% per annum, with the available labour supply. We cannot afford to continue with low-wage, unskilled and labour-intensive activities. In a full employment situation, we simply do not have the abundant labour that is required to satisfy the needs of labour-intensive industries and services. The rapid inflow of foreign workers cannot be our solution, as large scale entry of such workers creates social and other problems. The only real solution is to encourage economy in the use of labour and to shift away from low value-added, labour-intensive activities to higher value-added industries and services that employ less
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> labour, use more machines and have a higher skill and technological content. Moreover, our fully employed relatively better educated and trained population should be deployed in activities that are able to maximise their fullest potential.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External factors are also a crucial consideration in our restructuring policy. More and more developing countries with plentiful labour are adopting the strategy of rapid industrialisation through exports. China is also following this path of economic development. In the not too distant future, we will not be able to compete with them in unskilled, labour-intensive exports.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an open free-enterprise economy. The only effective way to induce employers to economise on workers and produce higher value-added products and services is to have correct wage signals. We could have closed the door to foreign workers and let the free market push up wages. The effects of such a course of action would have been traumatic. We have, therefore, adopted the more gradual alternative of guidelines setting a higher wage increase phased out over three to four years to give time to our employers to adjust.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages for the lower paid workers must go up by around 20% annually over three to four years to induce employers to optimise the use of labour and to restructure their business. The package of wage cost increases comprises an average 14% increase in wages for workers, a 2% training levy and a 4% increase in employers' CPF contribution. This package provides a buffer of 6% which in the event of a deep recession could be removed or lowered to moderate wage cost increases of employers. Moreover, if the wage cost increase of 20% were to be passed on fully to workers, the sudden jump in purchasing power will be too inflationary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides providing the buffer, the training levy serves as an economic tax. It is not a fiscal tax, as its purpose is not to raise public revenue. It is an economic tax to penalise employers who make no effort to reduce their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> dependence on cheap labour and improve their methods of production. Such employers will pay more for excessive use of our limited manpower and uneconomic employment of our relatively better educated and trained workers in unskilled jobs. On the other hand, employers can minimise their manpower cost increases by cutting down excessive employment of workers. Employers who are prepared to upgrade and restructure their operations and train their workers to do enlarged jobs and in new and higher skills will be able to benefit from the Skills Development Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training levy, as an economic tax, must therefore be applied across-the-board. This is not merely for administrative convenience. Exempting any particular sector or business from the training levy, simply because it employs unskilled workers, will undermine the basis of our restructuring policy. Moreover, as the wage increases in this sector will then have to be higher by the amount of the exempted levy, this unskilled sector or business will attract more workers to do unskilled work. Furthermore, no industry in Singapore can claim that they have reached the peak of efficiency such that there is no room for further improvement or that their operations are so rudimentary as to defy introduction of more skill-intensive methods or labour-saving devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what will the employer benefit by paying this levy of 2% if his company does not require skilled workers?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said that it is an economic tax. I have also said that I do not believe there are workers whose skills cannot be improved. Therefore, I feel that this levy is of benefit to the whole economy. In the case of the Government, it might also be claimed, for example, that there is not very much that we can do in the way of improving skills. In the legislation which I am going to introduce today, it is prescribed that Government bodies and statutory corporations will also contribute to this 2% levy, and I hope that the Government would, by initiating training schemes, also benefit by disbursements from this levy.

  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I thought I have made it clear that the answer is no, and that while we do not want to have the restriction imposed immediately, the intention is to gradually increase the restriction on workers entering into Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, what is the likely nature of this restriction? In other words, what is the percentage decrease? Can the Minister give us some order of magnitude?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I think the administrative problem is that there will be applications and that the Economic Development Board will assess the necessity of any particular numbers of workers which may be required and which cannot be found from either increasing the skills of the workers in Singapore and therefore reducing the numbers employed. The administration of this particular restriction will be, of course, done with considerable prudence so as not to disrupt the economy of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, the question really at the back of my mind is how effective the new wage policy is going to be if, over the

Secondly, if such is the case, then would there not be greater wage distortions in the economy? Thirdly, because of these wage distortions might the employers not have the incentive of getting rid of more senior workers in favour of immigrant workers so as to save their wage costs?

  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what steps are being taken to ensure that the wage-earners' take-home pay in real terms, taking into account the recent increment recommended by the National Wages Council, will not be eroded by excessive and unjustifiable price increases in goods and services.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, excessive and unjustifiable price increases in goods and services, i.e., profiteering, will occur when there is inadequate competition, short supply or inadequate market information. In general, we can ensure that the wage-earners' income is not eroded by profiteering by giving attention to several conditions. First, there should be genuine competition, without monopoly or cartel practices, especially in the production and sale of essential commodities like rice, sugar and wheat flour. Secondly, there should be adequate supply and, if possible, alternative sources of supply. Thirdly, the public should have sufficient knowledge of price and quality. Last but not least, the consumers must spend wisely and not excessively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the basic principles guiding the Committee on Profiteering and Inflation in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The work of the Committee is being stepped up. It is now monitoring very closely the prices and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> supply of essential commodities as well as some semi-essential commodities. If the situation warrants it, the Committee will establish an information system in the press and over radio and television to inform the public daily of the prices of common household consumption items such as rice, flour, bread, cooking oil, vegetables, fish and meat. The Committee will also work with INTRACO and other organisations to look always for cheaper sources of supply. It will study the market structure of relevant commodities to see whether there are cartel or monopolistic practices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee is working closely with organisations such as CASE and the NTUC Welcome and other Cooperatives in their efforts to curb profiteering and educate consumers.

   <b>DIESEL SHORTAGE</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what are the causes for the apparent shortage in the supply of diesel oil recently; whether there is any truth in the allegation of hoarding; and what measures are being taken to ensure continuity of supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the shortage in the supply of diesel in Singapore is the direct result of the global oil shortage. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has issued a statement to the public in the earlier part of this week explaining the causes of the shortage and the measures that have to be taken. I will now elaborate on this Statement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diesel sold at the pumps for the first half of this year has gone up by 27% over the same period last year. This is much faster than the average rate of increase of 9% for the previous three years. The surge in demand is due to a number of factors. Firstly, the economy is growing at a faster pace than last year. Secondly, more Singapore registered diesel vehicles are on the road. As at January 1979, the number of such vehicles totalled 33,200, an increase of 15%
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> as compared with the increase of 9% a year before. Thirdly, more lorries are also coming into Singapore from across the Causeway because of increased trade with West Malaysia. This trade has grown by 27% this year as compared with 6% last year. The increased number of lorries coming in is compounded by their abnormal purchases of diesel from Singapore because of a diesel shortage in Malaysia. Finally, prices at the pumps are lower than the prices paid by industrial consumers. Some industrial users are suspected to have been buying from the pumps.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply side, the world's supply of crude oil has fallen short of demand by about 5% since the Iranian crisis at the beginning of the year. Oil companies have in recent months been unable to supply sufficient quantities of diesel to the pumps to satisfy the surge in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Hoarding</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoarding occurs whenever there is a shortage of any goods. I therefore believe that there is some truth in the allegation of hoarding.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Measures</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked the oil companies to try and supply additional diesel to the pumps. In the short term, they can be expected to meet our request. In the longer term, we cannot expect to obtain additional supplies easily and cheaply because of the global oil shortage. We must, therefore, adjust our consumption to the available supply in future and change our life-style accordingly. The customs duty of 6 cents per litre imposed on diesel sold at the pumps in the earlier part of this week will help to encourage economy of consumption as well as eliminate the price differential between industrial diesel and diesel sold at the pumps.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As oil companies are restricting supply of diesel to the Singapore market, we have to control purchases by non-Singapore registered vehicles to ensure that they do not buy abnormal volumes of diesel from Singapore. They will be allowed to buy limited quantities from a few licensed petrol kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is a global oil shortage, we cannot expect supply to be always adequate to meet our requirements. However, the above measures should help to ease shortages if we adjust our life-style accordingly, and curtail our consumption.

  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, 18 applications for change of use of premises into association offices were rejected in 1977 and 12 in 1978. Three were rejected in the first seven months of 1979.

  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether he is aware of the seizure by the Building Control Division of fittings and furniture belonging to a certain civic association in spite of the discontinuance of any meeting or activity since its application for change of use of the premises into association office had been rejected; (b) which section of the relevant law empowers the Director of the Building Control Division to order seizure of the association's property; and (c) if he will instruct the Building Control Division in future to exercise more flexibility under the circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, I presume the hon. Member is referring to the Hwa Siah Musical Association at No. 86A, Lorong 25A. Geylang Road. An application to use the premises as an association was disapproved in August 1978 because the use of residential flats for non-residential purposes cannot be allowed. There were also complaints from neighbourhood residents about the excessive noise caused by the playing of musical instruments until late at night. The Building Control Division gave the Association a grace period till April 1979 to look for alternative premises. However, the BCD found subsequently that the flat was still being used as association premises. A removal exercise by the BCD was scheduled for 20th July 1979. However, the exercise was not carried out because of an appeal from the hon. Member. The BCD team did not seize any property.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Director, Building Control Division, is empowered under section 7 of the Building Control Act to seize all movable property found in a building that has been converted to an unauthorised use.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building Control Division has always exercised flexibility in carrying out enforcement action. The operator is always given ample time to cease the unauthorised use. Seizure of property is carried out only as a last resort.

  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, the Changi Point Jetty was reconstructed and the jetty deck extended as recently as 1978. The Ministry, therefore, has no plans to expand further the facilities at the Changi Point Jetty. Dredging work, however, will be carried out to deepen the navigational channels within Changi Creek. Work will start in September and will be completed by November 1979.

  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, the Animal Infirmary treats about 18,000 pet cases a year. There are no plans to provide a mobile unit, as it will be too costly. Furthermore, a mobile unit will not efficiently utilise professional staff which is in short supply in the Primary Production Department.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet treatment services are also offered by licensed private veterinarians. Some of them make house calls to treat pets which cannot be conveniently transported.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dog Control Unit regularly visits areas which are affected by development schemes to collect pets abandoned by people who have been resettled. In 1978, the Unit collected 21,000 abandoned dogs and cats. Mobile teams from the Unit will continue to patrol affected areas.

  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng</b> asked the Minister for National Development, in the light of current complaints received by the Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE), if he will explain why no provision was made in the Sale of Commercial Properties Act, 1979, to protect purchasers of commercial properties where such properties had been fully paid for but where purchasers had not yet been issued with strata titles although a certificate of fitness for occupation had been issued by the Building Authority; and if he will consider a cut-off date for strata titles to be issued to purchasers of commercial properties already fully paid for before the Act came into operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, the Sale of Commercial Properties Act and Rules came into force on 20th July 1979. It requires developers to use a prescribed form of agreement which, among other things, stipulates a

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font>

Where developers are considered to have unduly delayed the issue of strata titles, a cut-off date will be set for the issue of such titles. Appropriate action will be taken against developers who fail to meet the cut-off date.

  <b>Haji Rahmat bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for Social Affairs whether there is sufficient manpower for the ambulances as, when an ambulance attends a call from a flat resident, usually only one attendant goes up to the flat and the sick person is carried down on a canvas sheet instead of on a proper stretcher.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Acting Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai may like to know that the Singapore Fire Brigade has sufficient staff for the manning of 16 ambulances to cover the whole of Singapore. From 15th April this year, there are three officers for each ambulance instead of two. Each ambulance

  <br> is manned by an ambulance officer who is a staff nurse, an attendant and a driver.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The canvas sheet which the Member for Geylang Serai mentioned is actually a specially designed stretcher which is also used in the Accident &amp; Emergency Departments of hospitals. This type of stretcher is ideal for use in Housing &amp; Development Board apartment blocks. As it is not rigid like a normal stretcher, it permits the ambulance crew to manoeuvre narrow corridors, sharp corners, staircases and small lifts and lobbies. The patient is transferred to the normal stretcher at the ground floor. Each ambulance is equipped with at least two normal stretchers which are used to transport patients to hospitals.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Pharmacists Registration Act provides, inter alia, for a Pharmacy Board which has the Director of Medical Services as its President and Registrar. It has been considered that the pharmaceutical profession ought to be self-governing. Hence the Pharmacists Registration (Amendment) Bill seeks to alter the composition of the Pharmacy Board to comprise members of the profession only. The Chief Pharmacist of the Ministry of Health will, therefore, be the President and Registrar of the Board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act provides that any person who holds any qualifications recognised by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain can be registered as a Pharmacist in Singapore. The Bill seeks to discard this dependency on the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain by establishing our own
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sine qua non for registration. This will enable us to control the type and quality of Pharmacists in Singapore. This Bill re-defines the registration requirements of Pharmacists, so that registration is restricted to persons who have obtained pharmaceutical qualifications from the University of Singapore and persons who possess qualifications approved by the Minister for Health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sections in the existing Act which pertain to the Pharmacy trade. These provisions, which control the trade and the safety, quality and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, have been made in the Medicines Act of 1975. This Bill seeks to update the present Act by a deletion of those sections which have been adequately covered by the Medicines Act.

  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "Thai"the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a short Bill which deals with the taking of evidence in Singapore for use in civil or commercial proceedings abroad. At present, the law governing this matter is contained in certain United Kingdom Acts of Parliament of the last century - the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act of 1856 and the Evidence by Commission Acts of 1859 and 1885. It is desirable to replace these old statutes with our own legislation and at the same time modernise the law. In the United Kingdom itself the old statutes have been replaced by the Evidence (Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions) Act, 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for this Bill is to enable us to give effect to Singapore's recent accession to the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters of 1968. The main objective of this Convention is to facilitate the taking of evidence in member countries for use in civil or commercial matters. The Convention enables evidence to be taken in one member country for use in another member country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will empower our High Court to take evidence of witnesses present in Singapore for use in civil proceedings pending or contemplated in a foreign country. "Civil proceedings" is defined in clause 2 of the Bill to mean proceedings in any civil or commercial matter but the definition specifically excludes proceedings arising out of any fiscal, monetary or revenue law or measure. The exclusion is to ensure that our courts will not be obliged to render assistance in the enforcement of the customs, foreign exchange, taxation and other fiscal or monetary measures of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not deal with the taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings. This will continue to be governed by the unrepealed provisions of the United Kingdom Evidence by Commission Act, 1885, so far as Commonwealth countries are concerned, and by section 43 of the Extradition Act in respect of non-Commonwealth countries.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Bill, 1979, is to remove the requirement to register joint surnames for illegitimate children. Section 10(1) of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act requires an illegitimate child to have the surnames of both the father and mother if they are joint informants of the birth. This provision was introduced more than 40 years ago with the enactment of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act on 1st July, 1938. However, it was not strictly enforced until October, 1973, when the Registry of Births and Deaths began to check the marriage certificates of parents because of the marriage restriction policy for work permit holders. From October 1973 to April 1979, 1,109 children were registered with joint surnames.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint surnames are an unnecessary stigma to children born illegitimately. The Amendment Bill before the House will enable an illegitimate child to be registered under the father's surname if the father is an informant of the birth. Where the father is not an informant, the mother's surname will be given to the child. This is to prevent mothers from fraudulently declaring a person to be the child's father.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also enable any parent or guardian of an illegitimate child, registered under either the joint surnames of the father and the mother or the surname of the mother, to change the child's surname to that of the father where the father was an informant of the birth of the child. When the child comes of age at 21 years, he may apply for the change himself.

   <b>STATE IMMUNITY BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>3.30 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker (Minister for Law and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law and Science and Technology (Mr E.W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill deals with a highly complex and technical area of law important to international trade and finance. It codifies the law on sovereign immunity whereby foreign States can claim immunity from the jurisdiction of civil courts and tribunals in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the matter is governed by common law, where under the doctrine of absolute immunity, a foreign state or any of its agencies is immune from virtually all legal proceedings before our courts. This doctrine has been the subject of a great deal of criticism in the courts in the United Kingdom as well as the Privy Council. These courts have shown a tendency to modify the doctrine to prevent injustice and to bring the common law more in accord with present-day conditions. Many states and agencies of state are nowadays engaged in commercial or trading activities and there is little justification to preclude persons dealing with these states or state agencies in such activities from any legal redress.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the United States and the United Kingdom have enacted legislation to replace the common law rules of sovereign immunity in application to foreign states or state agencies when engaged in commercial or trading activities. It is considered desirable, not only as a measure of law reform but also to promote Singapore as a financial and commercial centre, that the law on the subject, so far as it concerns commercial or trading activities by states or state agencies, should be clearly established by legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be noted that since section 5 of our Civil Law Act provides that the law of England is to be applied in all questions or issues which arise or which have to be decided in Singapore with respect to commercial matters, it is possible that the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> United Kingdom State Immunity Act can be held to apply to Singapore. As there are certain provisions in the United Kingdom Act which are not appropriate to Singapore, particularly those concerning the European Convention on State Immunity, it is preferable to enact our own legislation so as to preclude the application of the United Kingdom Act to Singapore. This Bill is based on the United Kingdom State Immunity Act, 1978, but has been modified to suit our needs and circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that the Explanatory Statement to the Bill sets out clearly and fully the cases and circumstances in which foreign states or state agencies will not be able to plead immunity before our courts and tribunals. Lastly, I would draw attention to the fact that this Bill is not concerned with diplomatic immunities and privileges or immunity from criminal jurisdiction.

  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the liberalisation of exchange controls on 1st June, 197 8, money-changers and remittance shops were licensed annually by the Monetary Authority of Singapore under the Exchange Control Act. Licences and permits were last issued in April 1978. Following liberalisation of exchange controls, the Authority no longer has the legal power to license such institutions. As a result, money-changing and remittance businesses in Singapore are now not regulated by any law.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary that the Authority should continue to license money-changers and remittance shops in order that undesirable persons are precluded from the conduct of such businesses. There were 139 licensed money-changers and 55 licensed remittance shops operating in Singapore last year. A proliferation of money-changers, especially in favoured locations, may cause them to become a nuisance to tourists. In the case of remittance shops, regulation is necessary as they are handling funds of the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Money-changing and Remittance Businesses Bill now before the House provides for the licensing of persons who carry on money-changing or remittance business. The terms "money-changing business" and "remittance business" are defined in clause 2 of the Bill. Clause 3 specifically exempts retail shops and others who customarily accept foreign currency notes in payment for goods and services from the requirement of a money-changer's licence. Under clause 19, banks are exempted from the provisions of the Act. Apart from these categories, the Authority is empowered to exempt any person or class of persons from the provisions of the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides that the Authority may grant a licence with or without conditions or refuse to grant a licence without giving any reasons. In granting a licence, factors such as the character and financial position of the applicant, the quality of management of the company, if the applicant is a company, and the public interest will be taken into consideration. The Authority is empowered to vary the conditions of a licence or impose new conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who carries on money-changing or remittance business without a licence or who contravenes the conditions of a licence granted to him commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $5,000 or to imprisonment for a maximum term of six months or to both such fine and imprisonment. The Authority may appoint officers to inspect premises carrying on or suspected of carrying on money-changing or remittance business. Any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to admit
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> such officers to inspect the premises or fails to provide books or documents required by the officers in the course of investigation, commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $2,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides that a licensee who fails to comply with the conditions of his licence may have his licence revoked. Such a person may, within 21 days of the receipt of the notice of revocation or within such extended period of time as the Minister may allow, appeal in writing to the Minister whose decision shall be final.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitional provisions have been made in the Bill to enable a person who has been carrying on money-changing or remittance business, before the coming into force of this legislation, to continue doing so without a licence for a period of three months. Before the expiration of this period, he must apply for a licence to enable him to continue his business.

   <b>WOMEN'S CHARTER (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendments in the Bill before the House deal with divorce. Other amendments deal with maintenance provisions for wives and children and with offences relating to women and girls. Opportunity has also been taken to amend certain sections of the Act to remove anomalies which have been observed in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> applying the law since its inception in 1961 and to improve administrative procedures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 12 of the Bill provide for the renaming of the certificate for marriage issued by the Registrar to marriage licence. This will remove the confusion existing now between the certificate of marriage issued to couples after their marriage has been solemnised and the certificate for marriage which is the licence to marry. The licence to be issued by the Minister under section 20 of the Act for a marriage of a minor is to be called a Special Marriage Licence. The language used in the present solemnisation address in section 22(2) of the Act is archaic and not easily understood. It has been simplified in clause 10.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 empowers the Registrar of Marriages to compound the offence of late registration of marriage for a sum not exceeding $400. Presently, the penalty prescribed under section 33 for the offence of late registration is one ,year's imprisonment or a fine of $1,000, or both. This penalty, I feel, is unduly harsh.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, any married woman may apply to a District or Magistrate Court for her husband to make a monthly allowance for her children and herself under certain circumstances, e.g. if he has deserted her, is living in adultery with another woman or is a habitual drunkard. An additional clause has been included in the Bill which provides a husband with a defence against such a claim for maintenance by his wife in a District or Magistrate Court if he can prove that she has committed adultery or that she has deserted him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing procedures for the enforcement of a maintenance order in favour of a wife and child have been revised. Provisions to expedite the enforcement of maintenance orders made by the High Court and to make such proceedings less expensive for the wife or divorced wife have been introduced in the Bill, Clause 14 allows a District Court to enforce a maintenance order made by the High Court, and clause 15 enables the District Court to make an attachment of earnings order to secure
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> payments which the defendant is required to make under a maintenance order made by the High Court. The defendant is also required to inform the Court which made an attachment of earnings order against him of any changes in his employment and earnings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts Part IX of the Women's Charter which deals with divorce. Under the existing law, divorce is only granted when the petitioner proves that the erring spouse has committed a matrimonial offence such as adultery, desertion or cruelty. Parties to a marriage, however, have no difficulty in securing a divorce by collusion and by fabricating evidence. There is thus a cynical disrespect for the law and the institution of marriage. When the petition is contested, the system leads to unnecessary bitterness and has harmful effects on the children. We have studied law reforms in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia, and in all these countries the "fault" concept of divorce has been abandoned in favour of the principle of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House introduces new grounds for the dissolution of marriage, for divorce, judicial separation and for a decree of nullity of marriage. Two main changes are proposed. The first is that a couple can jointly petition for a divorce by mutual consent, provided they have been married for at least three years. The second change is that, where one party petitions for a divorce, it is necessary to prove that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. The grounds for establishing that a marriage has broken down irretrievably are similar to those provided in the existing Act, e.g., adultery, cruelty, desertion, etc. But the principle to be satisfied is that the petitioner finds it intolerable or cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant. Other proposed changes of the grounds for divorce are:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the reduction in the desertion period from three to two years:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the reduction of the period of separation from seven to three years if the respondent consents to the divorce; and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the reduction in the period of separation from seven to four years if the petition is contested.
  <br>
  <br>These proposed changes are necessary to meet the prevailing social mores in Singapore. The amendment will allow for the termination of a marriage with minimum bitterness. It simplifies divorce proceedings and will be less costly to all parties concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a marriage may be dissolved when it has irretrievably broken down, some constraints have been provided.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petitions for divorce will normally not be entertained within three years of marriage. Section 84 re-enacts the repealed provisions of the Women's Charter requiring the court, in which a petition for divorce or judicial separation has been instituted, to give consideration to the possibility of a reconciliation of the parties, and either to interview the parties separately himself or to nominate a Conciliation Officer to endeavour to effect a reconciliation. The interests of the children of the marriage who may be affected by the divorce may also be taken into account by the Judge in the divorce proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments have also been made to Part X of the Women's Charter which deals with offences against women and girls. Clause 18 of the Bill seeks to make it an offence for any person to detain a woman or girl against her will on any premises with the intention that she may have carnal connection, except by way of marriage, with any male person. The Bill also specifies offences relating to unlawful sexual intercourse. It is an offence for a person in charge of any premises to permit a girl under the age of 16 years or a mental defective to use his premises for sexual intercourse. An offence will also be committed if any person causes or encourages the prostitution of, any unlawful intercourse with, or indecent assault on, a girl under 16 years for whom he is responsible. Another amendment provides that a place is used as a brothel or a place of assignation if any evidence to that effect is given by a police officer not below the rank of Sergeant.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 proposes to amend section 138 to prohibit any newspaper report on any proceedings under Part X of the Women's Charter from revealing the name or address of any woman or girl in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed, or the name or address of any witness, or the particulars of any evidence given in such proceedings which may lead to the identification of such woman or girl. Provisions in the new Bill also provide for the Director of Social Welfare to detain any woman or girl in need of protection in a place of safety for such period as the Director may determine, even though the lawful guardian of such girl has refused to give his consent for her detention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 26 contains provisions to allow petitions presented before the date of commencement of the Women's Charter (Amendment) Act 1979 to be heard. It also provides that collusion is no longer a bar to relief in matrimonial proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the changes recommended are extensive, I therefore propose to refer the Bill to a Select Committee so that it can be examined in greater detail.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection." - [Dr Ahmad Mattar].

  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <pre>
*New sub-clauses (3), (4), (5) and (6) read as follows:

    "(3) The Registrar shall, on receipt of a reference
under subsection (1), have regard to the nature and
complexity of the dispute, and decide whether -

    (a)  to settle the dispute himself; or

    (b)  to recommend to the parties to the dispute to
         refer it to arbitration in the same manner and
         subject to the same terms that an aggrieved party
         under subsection (4) may refer a dispute to
         arbitration.

     (4) Where the Registrar decides to settle the dispute
himself and gives a decision thereon which aggrieves a party
to the dispute, that party may, within thirty days of the
date of the Registrar's decision, refer the dispute to
arbitration by a referee appointed by the Chief Justice,
who shall not be an official of any Government department.

     (5) The relevant provisions of the Arbitration Act
(Cap. 16) shall apply to any dispute referred to arbitration
under subsections (3) and (4).

     (6) Where a dispute has not been referred to arbitration
pursuant to subsection (4), the decison of the Registrar that
settles the dispute under pararaph (a) of subsection (3) shall,
on the application of the party in whose favour it is given,
be enforced by any Court which would have jurisdiction in civil
suits between the parties to the dispute in the same manner as
if the decision had been the decision of a District Court.".
</pre>
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern co-operative societies are large and complex. The types of disputes that arise among themselves and between them and their members can involve large sums of money or interpretations of their constitutions and by-laws. Attempts to settle the disputes could entail extensive analyses of the societies' business operations. In some cases, points of law may even be called into question. In such disputes, it would be desirable to ensure that the High Court is able to exercise the procedural and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> jurisdictional powers laid out in the Arbitration Act over the matters referred for arbitration under this clause of the Bill. I am therefore recommending this amendment so that parties to a dispute could refer the dispute to arbitration by a referee appointed by the Chief Justice if they are advised to do so by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, or if they are dissatisfied by the Registrar's decision concerning their disputes. Where such arbitration is resorted to, the provisions of the Arbitration Act will apply.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1965, the Botanic Gardens was a unit under the Ministry of National Development. In 1973, the Botanic Gardens and the Parks and Trees Unit of the Public Works Department were integrated to form the Parks and Recreation Division of the Public Works Department. In 1976, the Parks and Recreation Department became a separate department, i.e., the Parks and Recreation Department, under the Ministry. Consequent to these changes, the titles of office have been re-designated. Hence it is necessary to amend the old titles to the new titles.
