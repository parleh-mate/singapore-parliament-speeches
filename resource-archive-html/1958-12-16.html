<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee

of Supply [2nd Allotted Day]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (15th December,

1958) proposed to Head 25 in the First Schedule of

the Bill,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allotted for Head 25 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 31

therein."-(Mr Lim Cher Kheng).





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>FIRST SCHEDULE</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 25-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

at  the  close of yesterday's sitting,  I  started

saying  that  some  argued whether  Mr and  Mrs

Singapore  should have a fixed limit  of  children



because  of economic reasons. Sir, do the majority

of Singaporeans believe in this? It is for them to

judge.  Personally, I would say that  anybody  for

health  reasons can take advice; but, on principle

if the Government are going to give a donation, it

should  be  a token donation to a private  body - as

the  Government  are giving to others - but  if  the

Government  are going to be very beneficent,  then

they  should run this department under the General

Hospital  division or the Health Department.  Some

say  that  religious  objections  should  not   be

respected.  I say respect them. Government  should

not  do what is objected by others. But if it were

a Government department, no taxpayer would raise a

protest that Government is doing this or that. The

protest is against giving such a big sum of  money

to a private body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, I do not question the integrity

of  these welfare workers. Many of us have  worked

in private bodies and associations for the welfare

of  the people and they can help the Government in

that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I want to ask the Hon, the Financial

Secretary some questions. This $100,000  is  given

from  the  rate-payers' money, to which  many  are

objecting on religious grounds; first, what  voice

have  the  Government got as to how and where  the

Family  Planning  Association  should  spend  this

money? Secondly, have the Government any financial

check as to how the money is being spent, where it

is  being  spent  and  so on?  Thirdly,  have  the

Government any nominee on this Association? If the

Government  have not got sufficient  control,  the

best thing is to place this Association under  the

control of the Health Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I went through the statistics yesterday and I

am   now  going  to  a  different  aspect  of  the

question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be interesting to know what is really

behind the whole question of family planning.  Are

those  who  urge  and  organise  these  activities

activated  by  the love for children?  If  so,  it

seems a strange expression of that love that  they

should  endeavour to stop the coming  of  children

into  the  world.  Are  they  inspired  with   the

ambition   to  procure  for  everybody  a   higher

standard  of living? There are factors in  society

of  far  greater importance than a higher standard

of  living.  The Chinese squatter, who  tills  his

little patch of land on the hillside in the island

of  Singapore, or who raises chickens and tends to

his  egg-producing hens in the district of Mandai,

is a happy man. His standard of living no doubt is

not  high. He and his family are no drain  on  the

economy of Singapore. He sells his produce to  his

neighbours  and buys theirs in return. Above  all,

he  is  a  happy man. His children are  happy  and

carefree.  Their  names  are  not  on  the  police

records.  If  I  am told that in ten  years'  time

Singapore  will  have  another  million  of   such

children, I am not worried at all. But when I  see

one family growing up with the understanding that,

when  the age of puberty comes, they shall be free

to  give full rein to their sex instinct,  then  I

will really and truly be worried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has shown that with the release of the

sex  instinct  come  all  sorts  of  vices.  Man's

instincts  cannot  be isolated from  one  another.

Release one and all break their bonds. Release sex



and  man's  principles of right and  wrong  become

confused. His judgment becomes confused.  Let  sex

release  become  general and the weakness  of  man

becomes  a weakness of the community. The delicate

balance needed for social adjustment is thrown off

and  we  have confusion - family confusion,  social

confusion,      national     and     international

confusion - all leading eventually to a horrid  fear

of   war,   or  to  actual  war,  and  our   total

destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, what danger are a million

babies  in ten years from now if they are  decent,

well-educated babies?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Where to get the money from?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> It is up to the Government!

Might  we  not  direct  our efforts  towards  that

direction? Might we not invite our family planning

friends to change their names and become character-planners instead?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Idealist!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Would the $100,000 not be

better spent on advertising the benefit of leading

an  honest life according to the standard laws  of

old-time conduct? Have we ever thought of trusting

the  people of Singapore, of asking them  to  come

forward  with ideas on how Singapore may  be  made

morally  better?  If we have never  tried,  it  is

useless  to  throw up our hands and  say  that  we

cannot succeed. Family planning will stop a  baby,

but  it  will  not  stop wars. It  will  not  stop

gangsterism in Singapore. It will not relieve  the

police of one single headache.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Sir, I rise early

this  morning to endorse every word just delivered

by  the  Member for Bukit Panjang. He has supplied

us  with many details on the subject which he  has

touched on so learnedly, especially from the moral

point  of  view.  In my opinion, seldom  have  the

speakers  touched on the moral point  of  view  in

this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the Catholics are only

against  family planning. I think  that  is  quite

wrong.  Last  night I had a chance  to  meet  many

church and community leaders and we discussed this

subject. They said they objected not only from the

religious  point of view, but also from the  moral

point  of  view. They said, "Family planning  will

easily    lead    our   people    into    becoming

irresponsible." Sir, I will quote  an  example  of

how  irresponsible people can be. For example, the

Member for Tanjong Pagar - why has he not turned  up

this morning? Why did he not yesterday -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That, of course, is touching

on  the personal conduct of an hon. Member, and no

comment  can be made as to why a Member is absent,

whether we are on family planning or not!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, what I mean to say is

that  they make sure as to whether they will  have

any  responsibility or not. For example, in family

planning, they teach you a lot of art; how to  get

everything free without any responsibility, and so

sure  of  getting all the pleasure you  want.  And

there  is no burden to shoulder later on. That  is

why   I   like   to  ask,  "Why  are  the   P.A.P.

representatives not interested in taking  part  in



the  debate?" Because, Sir, they are not  so  sure

they  will  succeed  in  wooing  the  support   of

U.M.N.O.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> But they are so sure that

regarding  the Constitution the "piggies"  are  on

their side, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the hon. Member will not

confine  himself to the debate, then of  course  I

will  have  to  stop  him. We are  now  on  family

planning, and not on politics.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock):</b> Political

planning!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am sorry! I beg your

pardon! I was only quoting an example to show  how

human    nature   can   easily   be    led    into

irresponsibility.  A practical  example  for  this

House   to   consider  is  the   Family   Planning

Association.  If  you  go to the  Family  Planning

Association, you know you will get everything, any

advice  you  want, and then the danger can  arise.

Therefore, I purposely quoted an example  to  show



that when a person is not so sure that he can  get

what he wants, he is not interested at all. I  say

that  the  Family Planning Association can  easily

bring  up  the divorce rate and cause more  mental

patients.   In  the  so-called  higher   developed

countries unclaimed children are quite common. But

that  is not so common in Eastern countries.  Why?

Because we do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



believe  in family planning. We believe in morals.

We  live  on a spiritual rather than on a material



plane.  The  Family  Planning  Association  is   a

contrast to our Eastern culture and beliefs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have this

morning  been assailed with lectures on sociology,

sexology and moral standards. Yesterday,  we  were

told  to be confident. I had not intended to speak

this  morning but for the fact that  I  have  been

misrepresented as saying that the figure  of  $975

million  I  mentioned was the cost of running  the

Education Department. I wish to make it clear that

the   figure  of  $975  million  is  the   capital

expenditure required to build the 290 odd  schools

if  we  were to absorb one million children  under

the age of 14.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the estimated cost required to educate

all these children, I have taken the present basis

and  multiplied it by four - that is, we need  about

four  times  the teachers. Therefore,  the  annual

recurrent expenditure and personal emoluments will

rise by about four times, which means that we will

have  to  spend  $256 million on annual  recurrent

items  and on personal emoluments, and that is  in

excess  of the capital expenditure required.  That

brings me to another point, and that is we have to

have  about 34,000 to 35,000 teachers. At present,

we  have  about 9,000 teachers and if  we  have  a

population  of one million children in school,  we

will have to have about 34,000 to 35,000 teachers.

That will again lead to the provision for training



of  these  teachers  and  the  provision  of  more

training   colleges.  At  present,  the   Training

College that we have can take 3,000 teachers at  a

time for training. That is the maximum. Now, if we

are going to have about 34,000 or 35,000 teachers,

we  will  need  12 colleges. Has  the  Member  for

Changi  suggested any practical means to meet  all

this expenditure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, with the number of children in school,

there   will  be  need  for  more  trade  schools,

vocational schools, polytechnics and universities.

Does the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



Changi realise that one trade school will cost  at

least  $2  million to build and equip?  These  are

facts staring at us in the face. The speakers  who

have  opposed  this grant to the  Family  Planning

Association have not touched on how to  deal  with

such  problems. These are the problems  that  will

come  and face us, as I said, in about ten  years'

time.  The Members have given nothing but abstract

ideas - ideas  of confidence and moral standards.  I

have  yet to hear one person say how we are  going

to  face such serious problems in about ten years'

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  when I rose yesterday  to  support

this   motion,  I  specifically  said   that   all

arguments for and against had been fully discussed

previously and that there was hardly any necessity

for a prolonged debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard some of the fallacious arguments put

forward yesterday and today - and that by some of my

colleagues - I feel it incumbent upon me  to  answer

some  of these. Hon. Members will remember that  I

had previously repeated that on a subject such  as

this, one voted according to one's conscience, and

that  religion should not be introduced as a basis

for argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, my colleague the Minister for

Commerce and Industry sought to introduce religion

and advanced the argument that although the Muslim

religion  forbade anything to do  with  pork,  yet

money was being spent on pig-rearing.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of information,

Sir, It is very clear that I did not introduce the

religion  motive in the debate. It was  introduced

by  an  Opposition  Member and  I  was  only  just

pointing  out  that it was all very  confusing  to

introduce religion into this sort of a debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> But he did say that although the

Muslim religion forbade anything to do with  pork,

yet  money was being spent on pig-rearing.  May  I

remind him that, because Government recognises the

fact that anything to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



with  pork  is  against the  tenets  of  Islam,  a

special   slaughter  house  is  built  for   those

professing the Muslim faith? Furthermore, although

there  is a shortage of land, Government does  not

force cremations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another colleague sought to confuse hon. Members

by  the  introduction of figures to show how  many

schools  he thought it was necessary to  build  to

cope  with  what  he again thought  would  be  the

increase  in  school children. He  probably  based

this on the assumption that the present number  of

school  children would remain school children  for

the  next  twenty years. Could not an argument  on

figures  be  advanced in favour  of  crematoriums?

Every  grave occupies a portion of land.  At  some

time or other, if mathematically calculated, every

inch  of  land would be used by the departed  with

the  increase of the death rate. There is  nothing

more confusing than to introduce mathematics.  The

same colleague has on many occasions stressed that

the Family Planning Association does not, in fact,

advocate  birth  control  but  only  advises  when

advice  is  sought on the spacing out of families.

Is   he   not   tying  himself  up   in   hopeless



contradictions?  In one voice  he  proclaims  that

birth  control  is  necessary, otherwise  a  large

number  of schools will have to be built. He  then

urges  support of the Family Planning  Association

because   this  body  acts  only  in  an  advisory

capacity and only when advice is sought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Members going to be impressed with the fact

that  the number of persons seeking advice in  the

spacing out of families has increased from  a  few

hundred to a thousand or even three thousand? What

does  it  matter  whether 5,000 people  visit  the

Family Planning Association? What we who are asked

to  give money are concerned is how that money  is

being  used. We should have a breakdown  of  these

figures. How many of the 3,000 are from the better

placed financially; how many are from the literate

class and, most important, how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



many  are  from  the illiterate  and  impoverished

classes?  Does  the Hon. the Financial  Secretary,

whose   obsession  and  pet  baby  is  the  Family

Planning  Association, give a breakdown  of  these

figures when gladly doling out $100,000 of  public

money?  He is so eaten up and enchanted  with  the

idea  of  family planning that he does not  even

seek to satisfy the House on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other matters, as hon. Members know full well,

such  as the building of another hospital, outdoor

clinics,  increase of medical staff, the expansion

of   medical  and  social  services,  he  is  most

meticulous  and  every  cent  that  he  spends  he

justifies - and   ruthlessly  axes  every   possible

project  or  increase  of  staff - but  now  he   so

generously   offers   $100,000   without   factual

statements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the hon. Members are naturally impressed

with  the  words "family planning"  and  therefore

quite  rightly in their minds agree  to  help  the

cause with the firm belief that this will help  to

prevent  an  increase of the Singapore population.

But do let us be practical and realistic. Have  we



any  genuine  evidence, by  even  a  breakdown  of

figures  showing who are benefiting by our  money,

to satisfy us that our money is being spent in the

right direction and the right class of people  are

being  reached? Remember that in the U.K. and  the

U.S.A. and in fact many countries, the F.P.A. is a

voluntary organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again, if I may be forgiven for repeating

what  I  said  before, Sir, when  this  point  was

brought up by the World Health Organisation in the

House  of  Commons,  the Minister  of  Health,  on

behalf of Her Majesty's Government, replied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The British Government has no intention of

imposing  birth  control on any  native  territory

under its jurisdiction."



<br><br>And the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of

Health went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have also great responsibilities of our own

towards native populations under our jurisdiction.

Her   Majesty's  Government  have  set  themselves



against  imposing anything of this nature  on  any

territory under our control."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member identify the

document?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am reading, Sir, from Hansard, Vol.

1, column 1134.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan where there is only one set of people to

deal  with, experiments have been carried  out  in

villages where contraceptives are given to married

couples  and  a  certain  amount  of  pressure  is

brought  to  bear for the use of these.  And  even

abortion  is legalised. Although these experiments

have  shown a reduction of the birth rate  in  the

villages experimented on, there has been no effect

whatsoever on the overall birth rate in Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore, no such compulsion could ever

be exercised and a drop in the mighty ocean hardly

justifies    the    expenditure    of    $100,000,

particularly at this time when there is  a  crying

need for other projects which have been curtailed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refuse to be an ostrich, and I plead for a

little sane thinking. I ask Members not to be  led

away  by emotion or enthralled by the nomenclature

"family   planning"   without   more   sound   and

convincing  proof. That is the  reason,  Sir,  why

Government has always allowed a free vote  and  we

on this side are allowed amicably to criticise one

another.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no

intention of prolonging this debate. We have had a

rather  lighthearted  debate  at  times  on   this

subject,  but  some  of the  remarks  made  by  my

colleague call for clarification because they  add

more  confusion to the whole issue.  Sir,  let  me

make my stand clear, first of all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On principle, I am against any forced family

planning.  However,  this  is  not  forced  family

planning. On principle, Sir, I would say that each

man  has a right to live his own life, to  have  a

family  of  a  size that he feels he should  have.

Therefore,  I will be the first person  to  oppose



anywhere  any talk of any forced family  planning.

It  does  not  mean that even on  this  particular



issue,  I  support this grant. As I have expressed

myself clearly, I have no views either side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the remarks which I made in my speech

yesterday  about the susceptibilities  of  Muslims

and so on, my hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



colleague  says  that special slaughterhouses  are

provided  for  pigs and that Government  does  not

force the use of crematoriums on those who do  not

wish  their  dead to be cremated. That is  exactly

the  point, Sir - that there should be no  force  in

matters    in    which   there    are    religious

susceptibilities,  and  in this  particular  case,

there  is no force. This is purely voluntary  work

carried out by an Association and I said yesterday

that I do not know whether they do their work well

or  not,  and  nobody  is forced  to  go  to  this

Association and get advice if he does not want it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the other point and that is - I

said it very clearly and I think that I should put

it  clearer still - I am against family planning  in

principle; but what I said was that it is not  bad

as  a temporary expedient in our present difficult

economic circumstances. I also made it clear  that

if   certain  areas  of  the  world,   which   are

underpopulated, were to be opened up so  that  the

surplus population of other areas could be settled

there, then family planning would not be necessary

at all.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me, Sir, to another point raised by

the  hon. Member for Telok Ayer who said  that  if

family planning were carried out by Government, no

one would raise any objection to it. Sir, that  is

difficult  to  reconcile with  his  objections  to

family  planning  as  such.  Family  planning,  if

carried out by a Government department, would cost

more  money; and those who object to it  on  their

own  grounds  or on religious grounds  would  have

stronger  objections because, instead of  $100,000

which  the  Government gives as  a  grant  to  the

F.P.A., probably a million dollars would be  spent

on  it if the work was carried out by a Government

department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is that once a Government

department does this work and allocation has  been

made  in the Budget for it to spend that vote,  it

becomes  the duty of every Government Back-bencher

to  pass  it  through this House  and,  therefore,

there can be no free vote; in which case those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



on  the  Government  side who are  against  family

planning cannot oppose and those on the Opposition

cannot  lobby  the  Government  Back-benchers   to

support  them and there can be no free  expression

of  opinion.  Sir, free expression of  opinion  in

this  House will be curtailed once family planning

comes  under a Government department. It  will  be

under  the Whip then, which means that there  will

be no hope of a chance for those who oppose family

planning  to  have the decision reversed,  because

the Government always have a majority in the House

and they will have to carry it through under their

Whip.  As  it now is, Sir, this is a  grant  to  a

voluntary organization, and it is a free vote,  so

those   who  oppose  family  planning  have  ample

opportunity to try and get sufficient  Members  on

both sides of the House to say "No" to this grant,

in  which  case  the  grant  will  not  be  given.

Therefore,  Sir, this gives those who are  against



it a better opportunity to oppose it than it would

if  it  were  under a Government  Department,  and

under the Government Whip in that case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr  Chairman,  Sir,  my eloquent  colleague,  the

Minister  for Health, made it out that I  invented

mathematics and invented figures. Sir, the figures

I  quoted  were  not mine. They are  in  the  1957

Census   Report  and  I  read  it   properly   and

carefully.  He  further said that I  assumed  that

many  children would stay in school for 20  years.

Now,  I  said  that the statistics prove  that  in



about  10  years'  time there will  be  about  one

million  children under the age of 14. I  did  not

for a moment mean to say that the present children

will  remain in school for another ten years. What

I  meant to say was that in another 10 years,  one

million children will need education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also accused me of contradicting myself by

saying   that   family  planning  is   merely   an

institution  giving  advice when  sought,  and  in

another  breath  saying  that  I  advocate   birth

control.  If I have a say in this policy,  Sir,  I

would   advocate  birth  control   to   stop   the

perpetuation of human miseries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, I did not want to speak

on  this  subject,  but  was  prompted  to  do  so

because, of all the debates we have ever heard  on

family  planning,  this appears  to  be  the  most

interesting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said in this House before that the

question   of  a  grant  to  the  Family  Planning

Association should not be connected with religion,

because  it  would be wrong to argue on  religious

grounds.  I also said, three years ago, that  tax-paying   Hindus   would  surely  object   to   the

construction   of  abattoirs  where   cattle   are

butchered;  likewise  the people  who  believe  in

various  religions are prone to raising objections

to all kinds of public expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only want to touch on one or two points

which were expressed yesterday by Members opposing

this grant to the Family Planning Association. The

hon.  Member for Changi mentioned that this  money

should  not  be  handed to a private organization.

Sir,  I am sure the hon. Member is aware that  the



Association    is    a    registered     voluntary

organization,  having good objects and  aims.  All

its  accounts  are  produced  every  year  to  the

Financial  Secretary when it applies for  a  fresh

grant.  I  do not think, Sir, that it is right  to

argue  that  this  money should be  handed  to  an

organization like this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also suggested: why cannot the

office-bearers  of this Association  subsidise  it

with  their  own money? He implied that  they  are

rich  people  and  that the rings  they  wear  are

valued  at about $1,000 each. Sir, I think  it  is

quite  wrong  to ask the officers of  a  voluntary

organization to pay their own money for  a  public

purpose. This organization exists for the  welfare

of  the  people, and it is wrong to say  that  its

officers  should  spend their own  money  for  the

public   welfare.   Sir,   the   Family   Planning

Association has always helped and is still helping

people  in  the lower income group.  I  am  indeed

surprised that the champions of the poor  in  this

House  are opposing it because, by doing so,  they

are  denying  to the poor the privilege  which  is

offered by the Association. Sir, I think it is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



very  deserving  organization  and  it  needs  the

fervent support of all Members of the Assembly and

of all the people of Singapore in general.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  cannot  see  why we should be flogging  a  dead

horse year in and year out. This issue appears  to

me now to be more or less of a routine nature, and

every  year, when this question of family planning

comes  up,  there must be someone to  introduce  a

debate  on the subject. I am very happy that  this

is  the  last  Budget on which  we  are  debating,

because  this  is  the last term  of  the  present

Government. Only those who are re-elected to  this

Assembly under the new Constitution will  have  an

opportunity to introduce this subject, while those

who are very much against family planning would be

sore that they are not re-elected and will not  be

able to bring this subject up again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I expected this subject to come up

again  for  debate this year, and my  expectations

have come true. But another surprise to me is  why

hon. Members cannot accept defeat. Every year that

it  comes  up - this is the third time, I presume - it

is  defeated, and if we are considered  honourable

enough to he able to introduce legislation in this

country, let us be honourable and sporting  enough

to  accept defeat. Let us not try and flog a  dead

horse year in and year out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point why I am very glad, Sir, is

because  the Government have made some changes  to

the  vote  to the Association. Last year  we  were

asked to vote for $120,000. This year it has  come

down to $100,000, a figure which was approved  the

year before last. This is what I said last year - it

appears in the Hansard Vol. 2, No. 44, dated  18th

December, 1957 col. 3162:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what I notice, Sir, is the question of the

increase   in  the  grant.  I  think   we   should

concentrate  more  on the increase  in  the  grant

rather  than  on the actual grant itself.  In  the

year  before  last,  the Association  was  granted

$80,000. Last year, it came up to $100,000. It  is

now $120,000. As one Member pointed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



out  just now, where is this all going to end? Are

we  going to increase again the grant next year to

$140,000, and so on?"



<br><br>Sir,  I  am rather happy that the Government  have

not increased the grant from $120,000 to $140,000,

which  was  the expectation of Members last  year.

Contrary to that expectation, the Government  have



now reduced it to $100,000 which was the figure in

the previous year's Budget. This was my suggestion

and  I  am very glad that it has been accepted  by

the  Government. Every year I have abstained  from

voting on this item. This year I am going to  vote

for  it, not because of family planning itself but

because Government have accepted my suggestion and

stuck to that figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not reduce or increase that sum, because

this  subject has become so controversial that  it

has  been debated every year. Sir, I am voting for

it  solely  because of the figure of $100,000  and

not  because  of  the  merits of  family  planning

itself,  and also not because I have come over  to

the Government benches and therefore I should vote

for the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  hope,  after  me, only the Chief Minister  will

speak,  because we have gone far too long on  this

very  stale  subject. However, I cannot  let  this

debate end without expressing my opinion on family

planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are three types of men who find

themselves unable to support family planning.  The

first  type  is  the man - especially  if  he  is  a

Chinaman - who, having married for the purpose  of

having  a  son and heir, finds himself  unable  to

have  a  son and heir, for every time a  child  is

born  to him, it is a girl. Such a man has no  use

for family planning, because he must try again and

again to get a son and heir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of man, Sir, is a man who has no

child  at all. I understand one of the objects  of

family  planning is not to help to procreate,  but

to  help not to procreate. The third type of  man,

Sir, is rather a regrettable type - an old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



man  having reached the age where he finds himself

no longer interested in procreation at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a different type of man - a man

like  myself - who  has  suffered  great  hardships,

because  at  one time, Sir, I had to support  four

children  who,  at  the same time,  were  studying

abroad. Sir, if family planning had existed thirty

or  forty years ago, I am quite sure I would  have

made  use  of  it,  especially  in  view  of   the

experience which I have had. Sir, may I advise the

younger  generation that they  should  go  to  the

Family  Planning Association and make use  of  the

services  offered, so that in the  years  to  come

they may not suffer what I have suffered?



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I had not intended taking  part  in

this  debate.  I thought yesterday that  the  best

thing  for  anyone  to  do was  to  refer  to  the

Hansards for the past three years and take them as

read  and  then vote as usual! Sir,  I  have  said

every year that as this is a matter of conscience,

the  Government allows a free vote. Every year  we

have the spectacle of Ministers, who work together

under  collective responsibility, taking this  one

opportunity to let their hair down and go at  each

other's throats!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed surprised that every speaker on

this  motion  has not stood up and said,  "I  have

consulted my wife, and this is what we feel!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I have!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, my friend there has

consulted his wife and he has persuaded her  that,

according to his calculation, it is cheaper by the

dozen! And he admitted that it was cheaper by  the

dozen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us here, Sir, talk of morals. I would ask

hon.  Members  to  search their own  conscience - as

this is a matter of conscience - and think of their own

morals. Someone has just talked of sexual lust.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first started this in 1955, the gallery

was  packed with women, and the debate which  took

place then went to the extent of nearly describing

the sexual act! Sexual lust! I think it is because

women have to satisfy men's sexual lust that  they

have  to  be protected! And what is this? Just  to

protect  women?  "Mary, thou shalt  not  have  thy

sexual lust." But go ahead and have yours! Sir, we

want  to protect the health of our wives. Have  we

ever  thought of the pains, the fears and  worries

in  the minds of women when they give birth?  Have

we ever thought of that? We have not. All we think

is,   "Wonderful,   the   factory   is   in   full

production!"  And when the factory  is  unable  to

produce,   "All   right,  let  us   have   further

factories!"  That  is not the  way  to  carry  on.

Family  planning is not forced on anyone.  If  you



feel that family planning is going to help you, go

ahead and get the benefit. If you feel that it  is

not  going  to  help  you,  or  if  you  have  any

religious opposition to it, do not go to it. Every

religion teaches us to be tolerant. Let us all  be

tolerant of women's pains and tribulations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want

to draw the attention of the hon. Mr R. C. H. Lim

that there is no such nationality as Chinaman.  We

are Chinese, and not Chinamen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, the absence of the hon.

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar,  who  seems  to  have

boycotted  this debate has afforded us  plenty  of

time  to debate on this subject. So, let us  be  a

little more patient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our clever Chief Minister tried to impress us

with  a  wonderful,  fluent and  emotional  speech

about  protecting  women. Sir, his  speech  cannot

move  me  a  bit. Why did he not look at  it  from

another aspect? Is it because the F.P.A. gives the

husband  a sense of security? If so, what will  be

the  result?  Intimacy will increase.  The  result

will  be  many unwanted children. This is  evident

even  in  countries where birth  control  is  much

practised.  There will be many divorce cases.  Why

did the Hon. the Chief Minister (who is also the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for  Labour and Welfare)  not  think  of

that?  What  we  want is to maintain  our  Eastern

morals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir, I

would  like to ask the hon. Member for  Changi  to

give  the figures of unwanted children and divorce

cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, when I said "unwanted

children" I meant unclaimed children. Nobody dares

to  claim  them. We can take the figures  in  West

Germany, London and New York. Of course, to obtain

the  exact  figures, the Chief Minister  will  say

there are too many complications. Why did he  fail

to  answer the question I put to him? Why  did  he

not  consider these two aspects - firstly, unclaimed

children;  and  secondly,  morality - before  making

such  an emotional speech which, as you say, is  a

waste of time?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I never did say that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am so sorry, Sir, but to me

the  Chief  Minister has wasted  his  efforts  and

failed  to  impress anyone at all.  Unfortunately,

the   Minister  for  Education  is  not  here   to

challenge  me  when  I  say that  we  should  have

confidence  in  being  able  to  provide  so  many

millions of dollars in the years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a financial expert, but I can say

something  on the Budget. I want to point  out  to the  Financial Secretary this fact: for  the  year

1948 on the item of income tax, the then Financial

Secretary  collected $2,822,524.51. Did  the  then

Financial  Secretary ever dream that in  1957  the

collection  on the same item would be $65,208,000?

How  much more? I want to say this - if a person  is

confident, the future is his.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote another example - the revenue from

petroleum.  In 1948 it was $9,309,507.54.  Compare

that  with 1957, how much, Sir? $25-million.  That

is  enough  for  me  to answer  the  Minister  for

Education!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member gave way!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I gave way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I do not mind answering

the   question  raised  by  the  hon.  Member  for

Seletar.  I never said I doubted the integrity  of

the Family Planning Association. He said I doubted

the accounts and the management of affairs. Sir, I

categorically deny that I have any doubts  at  all

about  its registration, or the integrity  of  its

office-bearers. What I said was that many  of  the

office-bearers  belong to the very wealthy  class,

and it is easier for them to collect $100,000 than

anybody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, the Minister for Commerce and

Industry,  since  he  supports  the  principle  of

opposing  family planning, he will  not,  I  hope,

change his mind, but stick to that principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

regret  deeply  that this matter has  been  raised

again and dealt with ad nauseam each time for  the

last  three  years. A great deal which might  have

been  better left unsaid has been said. After each

deplorable  episode in the history of this  House,

one  has thought that perhaps that will be the end

of  it. But one has always been mistaken, and each

year the matter again comes up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  who have passed  in  a  matter  of

minutes Heads of Expenditure involving many,  many

millions of dollars suddenly decide to spend hours

debating  a  matter of a hundred thousand  dollars

for  a  service which anybody in his  senses  will

realise  can only be for the benefit of Singapore.

Furthermore.  Sir, hon. Members who have  remained



coyly silent for a year, even hon. Members who are

responsible  for  portfolios  in  the  Government,

suddenly  find  their  voices  and  criticise  the

conduct of the Financial Secretary in this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to take this opportunity of

expressing,  if I may, what might be  regarded  as

the  official view about this matter. Speaking for

the  officials of the Government, I regard  family

planning   as  one  of  the  most  potent   agents

available  to governments of the present  day  for

the  alleviation of one form of human  misery  and

suffering,  and for the control of the population.

This   has  been  appreciated  by  all  countries,



particularly  those in Asia where  the  growth  of

population   presents  a  serious   problem.   All

possible  steps are taken either by the Government

themselves, or with their blessing and assistance,

financial  and otherwise, to propagate a knowledge

of  the  virtues of family planning. It  has  been

appreciated   by  the  Government  of   Singapore,

because  the  problems raised  by  the  growth  of

population in Singapore are as serious as, if  not

more so than, those raised in other countries.  It

is  the  policy of the Government to  support  the

principle  of family planning and to give  it  all

possible  financial assistance. It  is  with  much

regret that it was decided to reduce the grant for

1959.   This   was  done  because  all   essential

recurrent services had been cut to the bone in  an

effort   to  balance  the  Budget,  and   it   was

considered  only  right  and  proper   that   this

recurrent  service,  being no  more  and  no  less

important  than the others, should be cut  in  the

same  way.  I can assure you, Sir, that the  grant

would  be  substantially increased if we  had  the

money.  Indeed  I am not at all certain  that  the

best   solution  would  not  be   to   take   this

Association  under the wing of,  say,  the  Social

Welfare  Department,  or the  Medical  Department,

provided that this can be done without losing  the

most  valuable voluntary support in terms of  cash

and  services which the Association obtains at the

present  time.  But  this is a  question  for  the

incoming Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, Sir, if I may say so, does an

outstandingly  good  job,  and  those   who   give

voluntary  service to it are a most devoted  band.

To them, the highest praise is due. As I said last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



year, the Association is run most efficiently  and

no fault can be found with its expenditure policy,

or  the control of its activities and expenditure.

We  have  no  representative on the  Committee  of



Management of the Association, but I am  perfectly

certain  that  if we ask for one to be  appointed,

our  request will be granted forthwith. But we  do

not  consider it necessary. We are satisfied  that

the  people  who are in control of the Association

are   people   of   the  highest  reputation   and

integrity,  and  they manage the  affairs  of  the

Association   in   a  most  efficient   way.   The

Association  itself  has  made  very  considerable

progress   over  the  years,  as  the   statistics

contained in its Annual Report will reveal. Nobody

ever   expected   its   achievements   would    be

spectacular,  but  progress has  been  steady  and

continuous  and  would  be  even  more  rapid   if

additional  funds  could  be  made  available,  as

undoubtedly they will be in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as I think I said last year, hon. Members

would be doing a great disservice to Singapore  if

they voted for a reduction of this grant.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have not spoken last year on this subject,  but

this  year I am prompted to say a few words  after

hearing  so much talk about it. In fact,  with  so

many  views that should not have been voiced here,

I want to say something on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is to ask the Financial Secretary

about  the grant in comparison with assistance  to

other   charitable  organizations.  Let  me   read

through  Head 25, choosing only a few of the  more

important items:



<pre>

<div align="center">

                                             $

   "British Red Cross Society              3,500



    Maintenance of St. Andrew's            5,000

    Orthopaedic Hospital



    Red Cross Home for                    25,260"

    Handicapped Children



</div>



and for a big hospital -

<div align="center">



   "St. Andrew's Mission Hospital        119,000"



</div>

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



Look at-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family Planning Association $100,000"



<br><br>The  sum  of  money given is as much  as  Planning

Association  with  that of a full-scale  hospital!

Talking  about the amount of good that is  brought

to society and humanity as a whole, can we compare

the  good work, or whatever work you call it, done

by the Family Planning Association with that of  a

full-scale  hospital? If we cannot,  and,  if  the

people of Singapore cannot agree that it is  doing

more  important work than the hospital, then I  do

not  see  why that figure should come so  near  to

that  involved  in the running of a hospital.  Now

let us again look at the other items:



<pre>

<div align="center">

                                     $

   'Boy Scouts' Association

    (1) Handicapped Groups         3,350



   After-Care Association          5,000



   Little Sisters of the Poor      5,800



   Malayan Association for

        the Blind                  2,500".

</div>

</pre>



To  cure opium addicts - $3,000. Now when we compare

all  these  figures, we can say  that  the  amount

granted to the Family Planning Association is  out

of  proportion to all the work done. It is  public

money, and it has to be spent wisely. We must give

it  in proportion to the work it is able to do.  I

bring  up  this point, Sir, because I  am  of  the

opinion   that  the  Government  have  not   given

sufficient  money for other welfare organisations.

If  the Singapore Youth Council, looking after the



youth of Singapore were to go to Government for  a

little  increase  in the grant, nothing  would  be

given. All other youth movements -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

going  too  far  away from the motion  before  the

House,  which is confined to family planning.  All

his  present  remarks could well be said  when  we

come  to the main Head, that is, the whole of Head

25,  when  he  can draw comparisons between  other

subheads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, Sir, I am speaking the

trend,  that this $100,000 (a large proportion  of

it, in fact)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



could better be used for the other sections.  Sir,

I  will  content myself with that because,  having

drawn  the  attention of the House to the  varying

sums, I can leave them to judge for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Chief Minister about

the protection of women, that is, helping them not

to be bullied by men, I think that is unnecessary.

We in this House have always declared that men and



women now enjoy equal rights. In fact, in a matter

like   this,  women  have  more  say   than   men.

Furthermore,  although we say that men  and  women



are  equal,  yet we give them a lot of protection!

We have many laws that are in their favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not happy about this grant of $100,000

to  the  Family Planning Association  for  another

reason,  and the reason was given by the Financial

Secretary just now. It is the official policy. The

official  policy  is to cut down, where  possible,

the  growth of population in Singapore. I know why

that  sentiment has been expressed  and  why  that

official policy has been pursued. In the West  the

population  has always been either at a standstill

or, as in England, on the decline. In the East the

population  is  always  increasing.  In  the  East

again, with the increase in population, as we have

seen  in  the  last War, land becomes  scarce.  In

Japan, for example, there are more men than  land.

Japan  could  not  possibly live  on  their  small



island,  and  they have to find land elsewhere  in

order to feed themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living in a very selfish world today.

Those  who have, say: "We will keep what we  have;



and  if you do not have, try to be contented;  try

to  live  within  your means; try  any  method  of

keeping  alive,  but  do  not  come  to   us   for

anything."  People  in  the  West  say:  "We  need

manpower  to  develop the land,  but  we  are  not

prepared  to  give it to anybody.  We  have  large

tracts  of land. We will keep Australia as  thinly

populated  as possible; we shall exclude  Asians."

If  the  official policy is going to  be  in  that

direction, I certainly see reasons there, and good

reasons too! If we can keep the population of  the

East right down to the bare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



minimum, then there need not be any giving because

there would not be people to ask! There need be no

war  because people there will not be wanting and,

therefore, the official view supports this  family

planning.   For   that  reason  I  oppose   family

planning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, there are two significant points I notice  in

the  debate  on this subject. One is that  no  one

seems  to  have  criticised  the  Government   for

cutting  down the sum from $120,000 last  year  to

$100,000  this year. The second point is that  the

Minister  for Health has opposed this  grant  very

strongly, which, I believe, is his primary duty to

do   so.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  he   has

represented  Singapore  at  the  Family   Planning

Conference  in Tokyo, he has still not learnt  his

lesson.  So I presume his visit is more  concerned

with  the  admiration of the snow in Fujiyama  and

the cherry blossoms in the streets of Tokyo!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family planning, Sir, is not, as many people

think,  just trying to prevent babies from  coming

into  the  world. Family planning  is  to  plan  a

family according to the needs of an individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is only an island of 224 square miles.

If  the  population is increasing  at  this  rate,



then,  I think in ten to fifteen years' time,  the

problem  facing us today will be very much  worse.

It  is  very  easy to say that the people  of  the



world are selfish. They have the land and they  do

not  help other people. They want to keep  it  for

themselves. But no amount of talk in Singapore can

persuade those people who have the land to give it

to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is situated in a very difficult

position  compared with other parts of the  world.

First,  we  do  not have enough  land  for  us  to



cultivate and grow food. Then we find we have very

little resources to promote industries here, as we

are  in the midst of the cheap labour area. It  is

not  easy  for  us  to supply only  the  needs  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people may argue about the present cost of

living  in Singapore. They say the cost of  living

in America is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



high;  may be ten times as high as Singapore.  Yet

their  industry survives. Why cannot Singapore  do

the  same? They do not realise that America has  a

population  of more than 150 million  people,  and

due  to the resources in the land they can provide

one  of  the  highest standards of living  in  the

world. Their industry is geared not only to export

to  other  countries, but also to home consumption

Take  for instance American cars, especially  cars

in  the  higher  bracket. The motor car  companies

there  are  not  interested in manufacturing  cars

with  a  right-hand drive because the number  that

can  be produced for export is very small compared

with what they can produce for home consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised by the Member for Changi is

that  family  planning is not a  policy  of  Asian

countries. I do not know what he is referring  to.

We  know very well that in India there are  family



planning  associations. When I was in  India  last

year,  I  heard a speech over the radio  given  by

Pandit  Nehru.  He said that India wants  more  of

everything  except an increase in the  population.

Communist  China today has family plan fling,  and



so  has  Japan  too.  I cannot recall  seeing  any

country  in  the  East  that  is  opposing  family

planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the remarks made by the Member for Changi

that  those  who  are now members  of  the  Family

Planning  Association and other voluntary  workers

should contribute to the $100,000 themselves,  and

that  the  Government should not spend this  money

themselves, I can assure him that those people who

are  working for the Association voluntarily  have

contributed not only much of their time and labour

but   have   also   contributed   money   to   the

Association. In this respect, I can say of someone

who  is  very near to me, that he is working  hard

everyday to achieve the aims of the Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think if there are any criticisms against the

present  Government,  it is  that  they  have  not

granted   enough  money  to  the  Family  Planning

Association.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I was surprised to learn this morning that  I

had  not  been spared the ordeal of the debate  on

family  planning. I was alarmed when I  looked  at

the  Order  Paper that we could well go  on  until

3.30  this  afternoon on this subject. I  suddenly

thought  that  somebody  must  have  discovered  a

magnificent new theory about either how to produce

more  food with more people, or some revolutionary

discovery  which makes family planning  completely

unnecessary!  But, unfortunately, no such  miracle

had  taken place. I think we would well be advised

just  to take the vote. Those who want to say  no,

let them say no. But to those who want to see some

effort  at  least  being  made  not  to  let   the

population of Singapore go out of hand - not because

people  want more babies, but because they do  not

know how to stop them - well, let us help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,399,230 for Head 25 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, under this Head, I find so

many contributions made to different bodies, small

and   big.  May  I  ask  the  Hon, the  Financial

Secretary what has happened to the request of  the

Chinese  Young  Men's Christian Association  which

officially asked for help in writing last year? In

the debate on the Budget last year, I remember the

Financial  Secretary said that he would look  into

the matter. When so many contributions are made to

so many bodies, I do not see why another deserving

body   like  the  Ramakrishna  Mission  has   been

omitted.  A  request was made in  writing  to  the

Financial  Secretary. Why was also a request  from

the  Sultan  Mosque for a grant to  cover  repairs

omitted,    when   I   see   under   subhead    30

"Ecclesiastical   Grants...  $12,700"   which   also

concern religious institutions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hundreds and thousands of dollars have been

spent  on  entertainment  and  travelling.  Should

Government  not  lend  a  helping  hand  to  these

deserving bodies who do a lot of social  good  for

the  benefit  of the people? They support  orphans

and  subsidize their education. Would  it  not  be

more  worthwhile for the Government to  invest  in

these   bodies   rather  than   spend   money   on

entertainment and travelling?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not have the

money at the present time to meet all the requests

for  assistance which are presented to  us.  As  I

said  last year, we would consider the application

of  a grant for a sum of $320,000 from the Chinese

Y.M.C.A. That was considered, but we felt that the

financial  circumstances at the present  time  did

not  justify our making a grant. I think the  hon.

Member  for  Telok Ayer did raise  last  year  the

question of grants to the Ramakrishna Mission  and

the  Sultan Mosque, and the answer I gave on  that

particular  matter,  that  we  did  not  have  the

necessary  funds  to give assistance  to  all  who

asked for it, holds good in this case.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the statement that vast sums of money

are   squandered  every  year  on  travelling  and

entertainment, that, Sir, is quite false.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,399,230 for Head 25 ordered to

<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my  intention was to move  an  amendment  to

increase the amount of individual relief and  also

to  increase  company tax, but this would  involve

getting  the consent of the Governor, and  I  know

that  it  is  not  possible. I would  not  do  it.

However,  I  shall  state  my  objection  for  the



record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the income tax in the lower income

group  is  unreasonable.  Personal  relief  to  an

individual  should be increased from  the  present

$3,000 to $4,000.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think hon. Members were

given a full opportunity to debate personal income

tax  when  the Financial Secretary moved a  motion

the  other  day, and it is out of order to  reopen

that subject in the Committee of Supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I do not know whether I can make

some observations, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

lost  his opportunity. The opportunity was  given,

as  I  said,  when  a  motion  was  moved  by  the

Financial  Secretary in regard to personal  income

tax  and when he moved the Second Reading  of  the

Income  Tax (Amendment No. 2) Bill, so that  those

two  subjects  in  so  far  as  this  Session   is

concerned are closed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, I have given notice of this

item  and the notice has been accepted. Of course,

Sir,  when  we  want to speak on  any  subject,  I

understand  notice must first be given. Therefore,

Sir, I was under the impression that, having given

notice  of this item, I would be allowed to  speak

on it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is perfectly

entitled  to speak, but what I am trying  to  tell

him  is that there are two subjects under the Head

of  Income Tax which have been dealt with in full.

There  has  been  a decision of this  Assembly  on



those two subjects, and, therefore, once there  is

a   decision  of  the  Assembly  on  a  particular

subject,  that subject cannot be re-opened  during

the same session. But if the hon. Member has other

subjects on which he wishes to speak, he can do so

by all means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry, Sir, but I am not

ashamed to admit that I am not versed in the rules

of  procedure and I would be very grateful if  you

would  advise me. My intention was just to express

my  comments - to  say  that company  tax  could  be

increased  a little more and personal  tax  relief

could  be  increased  from $3,000  to  $4,000.  My

intention was to speak on that, but if that is out

of order, I have no objection to it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am very sorry. The rules of

procedure  are,  perhaps,  complex.  If  the  hon.

Member  had the intention of moving amendments  to

the  suggestions of the Government in  so  far  as

personal income tax and company tax are concerned,

he  ought to have done so when those subjects were

discussed  in the Assembly. Does the  hon.  Member

still wish to move his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry. What I understand from

you,  Mr Speaker, is that it is out of order  for

me to take this subject at this particular moment.

Naturally I cannot say anything about it now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,953,880 for Head 29 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this

session  we have passed two Bills - one to  increase

the percentage of tax on chargeable income and the

other one on company tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I am coming back to ask the Government

whether  it has considered, throughout the  years,

the  plea  by so many Members in this  House  that

relief  be granted to the parents of taxpayers.  I

am certain we have heard arguments on this subject

for  the last three years and I would say that the

arguments still stand. If Government can  consider

granting relief to parents, I am certain  that  it

will be welcomed not only by those who pay tax but

also  by those who are at present not paying  tax.

Whether  a person is paying tax or not,  he  looks



after his parents. This is the set-up in the East.

It  is the duty of the children to look after  the



parents and, as we have heard many times before in

this  House, in Eastern families the care  of  the

parents is sometimes placed on a higher plane than

even  that  of the care for the children.  In  the

West,  we  may have the parents sent to the  homes

for  the  aged or sent to an institute  under  the

care  of the Government. But, in the East,  it  is

unheard of that such a step should be taken by the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to repeat all that was said

before.  I  would  ask  Government  seriously   to

consider the granting of relief for the parents of

taxpayers.  Even a small relief - a  token - would  be

accepted   by   the  people  as  indicating   that

Government  is aware of the request of the  people

and that it would look into this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in

supporting the Member for Serangoon, I  must  draw

the  attention of the Financial Secretary and  the

Government to the fact that this is not the  first

year  that this appeal has been made. Just  as  in

the  case  of  family planning, this  question  of

income  tax  relief comes into  the  picture,  and

appeals  have been made by Members of  this  House

for reliefs to be granted to the parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Member for Serangoon, it is

traditional for the Chinese - all Eastern  people - to

look  after  the parents far more than  after  the

children. The parents, when they grow old, rely on

the  children  to maintain them.  It  is  only  by

providing   full  education  for   the   children,

providing  them  with  everything,  that  the  old

people  look forward to the time when  it  is  the

children's duty to look after them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will again make this appeal to the Government,

on  behalf  of the people of Singapore, an  appeal

for an allowance for parents. It is most essential

and, as the Member for Serangoon has said, it will

not only be welcomed by those who pay tax but also

will be welcomed by those who do not pay tax.  Let

me make this appeal once and for all.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> My appeal to the Government is to

increase  the tax relief for individuals from  the

present  $3,000  to  $4,000,  and  the  relief  in

respect  of  women  from  the  present  $2,000  to

$3,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to make up for the loss by this relief for

individual  tax,  the  Government  could  consider

increasing company tax from 40 per cent to 45  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 45 per cent could be obtained from

chargeable incomes of $100,000 and over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I am not out of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

It  was actually not my intention to speak, but  I



saw  other  hon.  Members were  speaking  on  this

subject, so I thought I would be allowed to speak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

probably  treading on very thin ice. If he  wishes

to   debate  on  company  tax  (which  is  40  per

cent) - his   suggestion  is  that  it   should   be

increased  to 45 per cent - then, of course,  he  is

out  of  order. But if he is content with what  he

has said up to now, then he is just in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. I know that

almost  all  the Members who spoke on company  tax

attacked  the  Government for increasing  the  tax

from  30 per cent to 40 per cent. Well, my  appeal

is  for a further increase of from 40 per cent  to

45  per cent. My reason, of course, as I told you,

is to make up for the increased tax relief for men

and women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my argument in favour of raising company tax

to  45 per cent is, of course, the same defence as

that  put forward by the Financial Secretary  when

he  replied to the attack by those Assemblymen who

thought  that  that  company  tax  should  not  be

increased to 40 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

now  embarking on a debate on company tax. He must

understand  that  he  is out of  order.  The  hon.

Member cannot embark on a debate on company tax at

this juncture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I am sorry. Mr Speaker, Sir. You

have  cautioned me several times. I  just  do  not

want to make things look awkward. I really thought

it  was  in  order when I gave notice.  I  thought

there would be an opportunity for me to speak,  in

the  first  instance, but since it was going  into

Committee,  I thought I could take up this  matter

by giving notice. Since I know it is very delicate

to  dwell on a subject that has already been taken

up, I do not want to say anything further.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps I could be of some

assistance  to  the  hon.  Member.  If   he   will

consider,  perhaps,  sending  in  a  question   or

questions  on the subject of company tax  for  the

next  sitting,  he  could be able  to  ask  a  few

questions on it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Thank you, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,953,880 for Head 29 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 30-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

R. Jumabhoy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 30 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1

therein.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have given notice of an

amendment  but since I have taken up the  question

of  salaries  for Ministers as a whole  under  the

Head of Chief Minister, I have nothing further  to

say on salaries.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is not moving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Lim Cher Kheng -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 30 be

reduced  by  $10  in respect of item  (1)  (i)  of

subhead 10 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Lim Cher Kheng's absence, the amendment

was not proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $805,330 for Head 30 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, if as much

time  were to be spent in this House in discussing

the commerce and industry of Singapore as has been

spent on the Family Planning Association, we might

perhaps be making some contribution to the  future

welfare  of  this country. But I doubt  very  much

whether  we  shall in fact have a debate  of  that

magnitude on this particular subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a feeling of concern and anxiety, I am

quite  certain, on all sides of this House at  the

position of Singapore as a trading centre and,  as

we  would  like  to  see it, a growing  industrial

island.  As I pointed out last week, we are  faced

with the position of a declining number of workmen

employed  in  manufacturing and in all industries;

and I made the point that in March 1958 there were

51,000 workmen employed in manufacturing, which is

almost equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



or  about equal to the increase in population year

by  year. That is a most alarming position  to  be

in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also pointed out that the yield from income tax

does not go up except through the artificial means

of  increase in rates, and that also reflects  the

fact that there is no expansion of industry in the

way that we would like to see.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just recently passed the Pioneer

Industries and the Industrial Expansion Bills, and

I  would  like  to  know from  the  Minister  what

effect, even at this early stage, these have  had,

and  how many applications he has received for the

setting up of new industries and new factories. We

have  heard that already the Federation expect  40

new factories to be built next year, although they

have    only   just   recently   passed    similar

legislation.   We  should  like   to   know   what

indications  there  are regarding  the  future  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to know how many industries

have   been   launched  through   the   Industrial

Promotion  Board. When the Board was formed,  this

Assembly  approved a sum of a million dollars  for

the  promotion of industries. We said it  was  not

enough and the Minister said that more money would

be   forthcoming  if  it  was  required.  But  the

financial  situation is such that we do not  think

that  this  is  so now. In fact, we  are  spending

under the estimates for next year, $68,500 to  run

the  Industrial Promotion Board. We would like  to

know  what success the Board is having and whether

we are getting value for money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to know further what progress the

Minister  has been able to make with his cigarette

factory  which has had so much publicity. When  it

was  announced, we assumed that the  Minister  had

already got the support of tobacco companies,  but

this  apparently is not the case, and the cart  is

being  put before the horse. Sir, we would like  a

review from the Minister of just what progress  we

are  making,  as  the impression is  that  we  are

slipping backwards and not going forwards.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know, and we all appreciate, that we are

faced  with  this dilemma of wanting to encourage,

or  at least maintain, our free entrepot trade  on

the  one  hand and at the same time we  are  faced

with the need for protection of our own industries

on  the other hand. The dilemma as to whether, for

example, we should let in torch batteries made  in

China,  selling now in the city at  15  cents,  or

protect our own production of torch batteries at a

higher figure of 20 to 25 cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the life of the present Government, this

problem  has not been solved. I do not  place  the

blame  entirely at the door of the Government.  On

this  side  of  the House, though we have  pressed

this  matter continually - and I hope that  we  have

made  some contribution - it is significant that  we

have had no single constructive word in this House

from  the  People's  Action Party  on  industrial,

commercial  and economic matters. If they  have  a

policy,  they  have  never  disclosed  it.   Their

interest  in the future of Singapore seems  to  be

clearly political.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it may be, the future of Singapore

depends  on trade, commerce and industry,  and  we

hope  that the Singapore electorate will  remember

that when the general elections take place.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, this Ministry of Commerce

and  Industry is most important for the  existence

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other day in my Budget speech I said

that  the previous Council left $200,000,000 which

is  now  reduced to $83,000,000 in liquid  assets.

The  duty on petrol was 68 cents a gallon when the



present  Government took over, and it is  now  $1.

Then  I  went  on  to the duty on cigarettes.  But



there  is in the Press a story to the effect  that

the Minister for Commerce quoted me as saying that

I   liked  the  previous  Government.  Why   twist

statements which a Member has never made?  What  I

only  said,  Sir, was this. The last Council  from

which  the present Government inherited was  this,

this  and  that. I never praised or said  anything

against or for the previous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



Council.  I  hope  a  person in  that  responsible

position should not twist the statements  made  by

Members.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, all these three years, Sir, as

far as possible, I have refrained from speaking on

this  subject  for  obvious  reasons,  though   I,

personally, have been the founder and President of

the Indian Chamber of Commerce for 12 years. I was

twice elected by the Indian Chamber of Commerce to

the  Legislative Council. With that experience,  I

would  not  be  talking  to  injure,  but  talking

something   constructive.  But   if   the   people

concerned are not willing to admit their mistakes,

well, what could be said?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Minister also made this remark: "Look,

the  Members opposite are not taking an  interest.

They are not there."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the life of the present Government is

ending. What we have said has fallen on deaf ears.

We  are not willing to hear any more bluffs.  This



is   a   Ministry  on  which  Singapore   depends.

Responsible  words  should be uttered.  I  am  not



criticising, Sir, I am asking. During these two or

three years, did the Minister not appoint a Select

Committee  on luxury tax? This caused  uncertainty

in  the minds of small and big traders for months.

The  Council of Ministers was responsible for this

instability  in  trade. The trader thought,  "What

items  will  be taxed or restricted?" He  did  not

know where he was standing for months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then also this same Minister made a statement

that  sooner or later there might have to be  some

import duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a merchant of 45 years'

standing.  Though I retired a few years  ago  from

active  business, I still could gauge the feelings

of   the   merchants.  What  are  the   goods   or

commodities to be taxed by import duties? Shall we

hold  on or shall we import? Shall we not do  this

trade  or  that?  Now, such statements  from  this

Ministry should not have been made in the way they

were made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the cigarette factory and the Bill in

Select  Committee concerning it. Sir,  that  is  a

department which is the life-line of Singapore. My

remarks are for the incoming Government - that  this

Ministry  should  be run in such  a  way  that  it

should safeguard the interests of trade, on  which

our existence, employment, and everything depends.

I have no further comments than that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it looks

as  if I have to repeat the question which I  have

already  asked  the  Minister  for  Commerce   and

Industry.  Sir,  the  question  is  this:  Can  we

achieve  a Pan-Malayan economic policy? Without  a

Pan-Malayan economic plan, Sir, all the efforts of

the  Minister  for Commerce and Industry,  despite

his  energy  and  ambition to set  up  a  people's

cigarette factory, would be in vain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just cannot understand how to reconcile this

fact:  on  the one hand, Singapore should maintain

an entrepot status, and, on the other hand, how to

solve the unemployment problem of this country and

to speed up industrialisation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have been entirely cut away,

politically,  from the Federation of  Malaya.  And

yet  one  of  the Ministers in the  Federation  of

Malaya has admitted that we must look after  their

interests, because they are the life-line  of  the

entrepot  trade. Sir, the so-called  one  economic

unh  for  Malaya and Singapore is  just  on  paper

only.  It is mentioned in political gossip but  it

is not practised. There is no Pan-Malayan economic

plan  in  practice, which shows  that  Malaya  and

Singapore are really and truly one economic  unit.

Can   the   Minister  for  Commerce  and  Industry



honestly tell us how he can maintain Singapore  as

a  prosperous entrepot and, at the same time,  his

long-time  dream  of  industrialisation  in   this

country? Let us have a firm assurance that  he  is

not  coming back to this Assembly and saying:  "We

failed because we could not get the Federation  of

Malaya to understand us. We could not get their co-operation."  In  other  words,  do  not  say  that

everything has failed on account of the failure to

merge with the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have purposely emphasised this important

topic.   It   is   high  time  for   the   elected

representatives  of  the people  of  Singapore  to

decide  Singapore's future relationship  with  the

Federation of Malaya. Merger seems to be a popular

slogan  of all the political Parties but  only  in

Singapore. In the Federation of Malaya it has been

openly  and  officially denied. Also it  has  been

opposed  by  one  of the very important  Ministers

there.  The  proposed constitution of the  M.C.A.,

the  governing  Party  of the  Federation,  has  a

clause to the effect that if Singapore is going to

merge with the Federation of Malaya, they say that

they  are  going to cause a split in the  Alliance

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not sufficient for us, the people of

Singapore, to know why the Federation Minister  of

Commerce,  the  Hon. Mr Tan Siew Sin,  so  firmly

believes that if there is a move to boost a merger

between  Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya,

they are going to have a serious split. Do you not

think  that that is a sufficiently serious warning

to  Singapore, not only to the people but  to  the

Government as well? Hope of a merger is  far  away

from  us. So how can our own Minister for Commerce

and  Industry  still come to this House  and  say,

"Yes,  we  must co-operate with the Federation  of

Malaya. We must co-ordinate with the Federation of

Malaya. We must believe and have confidence  in  a

merger.  If there is no merger, we die.  Singapore

will be finished. If things fail us, it is because

we   could  not  get  the  co-operation   of   the

Federation  of Malaya, and because the merger  has

not arrived yet."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said that 1958 has been a year of

instability and insecurity - instability in politics

and  in  economy. I also said that 1958 has opened

the  eyes of the people of Singapore, or at  least

it has sown some doubts in the minds of the people

of  Singapore  that the merger will  really  be  a

reality.  What  is the cause of the split  between

Singapore  and Malaya? Everybody says it  is  man-made.  Even our Minister for Commerce and Industry

has  admitted  that  there  is  a  man-made  split

between  Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya.

Since there is this man-made unnatural separation,



bow then can there be a natural merger?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



12.00 noon



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we not analyse the actual cause of

this   split,  this  separation?  In  one  of   my

speeches,  I said that even if Mr Chin Peng,  the

Secretary-General of the Malayan Communist  Party,

were  to  become the Prime Minister of  Singapore,

the  British  would have no fear at  all,  because

they have the Lennox-Boyd Constitution and not the

Rendel  Constitution. That is enough  to  tell  us

that  the cause of the separation is in the  hands

of  the  Rt.  Hon. Mr Lennox-Boyd,  Secretary  of

State  for the Colonies. So the situation is  like

this - although we say we are the champions  of  the

people we are genuine nationalists; we must  admit

that we have earned our so-called national freedom

not  through  a  single blow or a single  drop  of

blood  or  a bullet. So if we expect such  a  nice

gift  from a well experienced imperialist colonial

power,  without  any  safeguards  for  their   own

interests, then we are fools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is high time for us to tell the

people  the truth - that a merger between  Singapore

and  the  Federation of Malaya is not by agreement

between  Tunku Abdul Rahman and Tun Lim Yew  Hock,

our  Chief  Minister. We must rely on developments

in  Asia, even international developments. We  can

predict, we can say that in ten or 20 years'  time

as  long  as  the  situation  in  South-East  Asia

remains  much  the  same as it is  today,  then  a

merger  between  Singapore and the  Federation  of

Malaya   will   not  be  realised.   The   interim

Government,  during  this  period  must   take   a

realistic policy - that politically we are separate,

but  economically we must try our very best to co-operate  on equal terms and to our mutual benefit,

and not have a one-sided beneficial arrangement as

in  the  past three years. The people of Singapore

are getting sick of hearing that the Government of

Singapore  are  always going to  Kuala  Lumpur  to

listen  to  or  to  receive  orders  that  we  can

introduce this Bill, but we cannot introduce  that

Bill. And all to protect whose interests, Sir?  If

the  Federation of Malaya really have the interest

of  the  people of Singapore at heart, they should

recognise  the  importance of Singapore  and  they

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



appreciate  the  continuation  of  the   port   of

Singapore  which renders a great  service  to  the

Federation of Malaya. They should not try to build

another  port  in  the  Federation  of  Malaya  to

challenge  Singapore. By building Port Swettenham,

the  people  of Singapore have no doubt  that  the

Federation  of Malaya have made up their  mind  to

forsake  Singapore, to throw away  Singapore.  Why

should  the Federation of Malaya dump millions  of

dollars  in  building  Port Swettenham?  Sir,  the

reason  is  obvious.  If the leaders  of  the  two

territories have Pan-Malayan interests  at  heart,

they  should  realise that a loss to Singapore  is

also a loss to the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember touching on this subject. If an

industry in Singapore is forced to shut down,  you

simply  say,  "You  apply  to  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  They  are going to give a lot  of  vacant

land in Petaling Jaya. That is an industrial area.

There  is plenty of vacant land for you." Sir,  it



is  very simple to get a piece of vacant land  and

offer it to Singapore manufacturers, but how about

the expenses of installation? Whose loss is it? It

is not the common loss of the Federation of Malaya

and  Singapore. The Federation of Malaya go  along

with  their own economic development. They woo  as

much  as  they can Singapore's existing industries

to shift to the Federation of Malaya. Do they care

what  is going on in Singapore? They do not  care.

They   can  borrow  money  much  easily  from   an



international body. I am not surprised, Sir,  that

very  soon  they are going to seek  American  aid,

Sir,    when   Port   Swettenham   is   completed.

Singapore - where does she stand? She  has  been  an



outlet for the tin and rubber in the Federation of

Malaya.  Piece-goods will not be imported  through

the Johore Causeway any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I deeply regret that I have touched on such

a   serious  question.  The  people  of  Singapore

generally  have  lost faith and  confidence  of  a

merger   with  the  Federation  of  Malaya.   Only

ambitious and selfish political leaders,  as  soon

as they come into power, try to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



bluff the people that merger is a must and that it

is  going to be very soon. Sir, it is very  unfair

for  the  people  of Singapore who  are  not  well

informed  of  the situation. The actual  stumbling

block to a merger is not the language problem,  to

make  Melayu  the  lingua  franca.  Merger  is  an

economic and political affair.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, on a point of order. I

think the hon. Member has spoken at length on  the

impossibility  of  merger and backed  it  up  with

evidence. But as I have got to answer him, I would

like him to say what his suggestion is, or what he

expects the Government to do.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, my humble advice to the

Minister  for Commerce and Industry is  this - stand

up  and  fight for our survival. We must not  wait

and preach, "Merger. Without merger, we die." If I

say  to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Member for

Changi  can fly, you will say, "Yes, just show  me

how  you can fly." I will say, "Wait until I  feel

both  my arms have turned into wings, then  I  can

fly." Sir do you believe it? Of course, I can  say

I can fly. The same also applies to the merger, to

this  economic  problem.  Every  political  leader

tries to put every excuse on this merger. They  do

not  try  to find their own solution. They  simply

say,  "Wait  until  there is a  merger."  And  the

merger, as I have already analysed, is very,  very

far  away.  It is not in the hands of  either  the

Singapore  Minister for Commerce and  Industry  or

the  Federation Minister of Commerce and Industry,

the Hon. Mr Tan Siew Sin. Sir, the merger between

the  Federation of Malaya and Singapore lies  with

Whitehall  and if we go a little deeper  into  the

matter,  even  the  White House  is  going  to  be

involved.  If the international situation  demands

that   Singapore  must  remain  a   military   and

strategic base, then the merger will be just  only

in our dreams. And if so, Sir, why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



do  we not choose the right time to tell the truth

to  our  people - that it is time to  stop  thinking

about the merger? I am not for one moment going to

deny  that  it  is natural that the Federation  of

Malaya  and Singapore must be one unit,  based  on

historical,  economic, political,  and  especially

cultural  factors. But what can we have? Our  fate

is  in somebody else's hands. We are a weak and  a

small  nation and we just have to be at somebody's

mercy. Let us admit it. Let us tell the people  of

Singapore  that we are at the mercy of some  other

powers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think this is an

appropriate time to suspend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

continue  with my speech this afternoon,  I  would

like  to place on record the deep regret over  the

attitude of certain Members of this House  towards

the  debate on such an important Budget.  I  stand

corrected if I am wrong. I think it is the duty of

an  elected  representative to take a  keener  and

closer interest in the Budget. Yet the turn-out of

the  Assembly today and even the spectators in the

gallery -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member may just

confine  his  remarks very briefly to  Members  of

this  House, but I do not think he should turn  to

the  gallery - he is speaking to the Chair,  not  to

the gallery.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, on such an important

debate,  I  wonder why hon. Members of this  House

should show a cold attitude towards this debate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

said  enough,  because now he is  approaching  the

personal  conduct of hon. Members of this  House,

and he knows under Standing Orders he ought not to

do  so.  I  think  he ought to continue  with  the

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, may it please you, I

withdraw.  Sir,  this morning  I  touched  on  the

serious point of merger. Many times I have  stated

in  this House that, despite the efforts put up by

the energetic, ambitious Minister for Commerce and

Industry,  he has never achieved what is  expected

of him or what he had promised us - that he is going

to  provide a full-grown entrepot trade,  a  full-grown  programme  of  industrialisation.  I   have

analysed the fundamental dead-lock, and found that

the  cause  of  the  failure of the  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry  is  closely  linked  with

merger. As long as we cannot achieve what we  want

and what we expect - a Pan-Malayan economic plan  or

policy - then,  no matter who is in the  Government,

no  matter  who is the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry,   economic   instability   wilt    still

overshadow  Singapore. Therefore. I now especially

wish  to emphasize the question of merger. Now  is

the  right  time for us to adopt an  entirely  new

approach to the question of merger. It is now time

for  all  the leaders of this country to tell  the

people  the truth - that the question of  merger  is

neither in the hands of Tunku Abdul Rahman nor the

Hon.  Tun  Lim Yew Hock; but, Sir, it  is  in  the

hands of the Rt. Hon. Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd, who is

so very far away from here.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is not the hon. Member repeating

himself? There is a Standing Order which says that

repetition, if it becomes tedious, is not allowed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. The

key  to  merger  is in the hands of  Whitehall  in

London.  To  go a step further, Sir,  the  key  is

shared  between the White House in Washington  and

Whitehall. To go yet a little further,  it  is  in

the hands of the whole Commonwealth, the so-called

free  world. Therefore, if it is so, why  are  our

people  not  entitled to know the exact  position - that merger is very far away, I dare to say in ten

or  twenty  years' time? When will that  be,  Sir?

Until  South-East Asia is stabilised; until  peace

is  achieved for the whole world, and the conflict

between the East and West is settled; when we  can

say that the people of this region hold their fate

in their hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not be hypocrites. A hypocrite fools

himself  and  others. Everyone in  this  House  is

fighting  for freedom. Were they ever  in  prison?

Had  they  ever fired a single bullet, or  shed  a

single drop of blood? No, Sir. Therefore, this so-called political freedom, the so-called symbol  of

national   aspiration,  is  given  at  a   certain

discount.  And if so, then why should we  continue

to  fool our people and say, "You vote for me. You

return  me  to power, and then I will promise  you

everything - everything which you  can  see  in  the

papers,  or  hear during the election  campaign."?

But  it  is  not so in practice. No  matter  which

government is in power, the same failure is  going

to be met with; the same mistake which the present

Government has made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to details, Sir, on the entrepot trade.

We  are lucky to have a few commerical leaders  in



this  House  to  tell  us how  badly  hit  is  our

entrepot  trade.  Imports of  raw  materials  from

international ports get less and less as time goes

on.  Has  this  Government  made  any  attempt  to

negotiate  or  find  a  solution  to  improve  our

international trade?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the subject of smuggling. With

this  invisible  trade going on, I cannot  imagine

what kind of a port Singapore is going to be.  Why

cannot  we  have  regular, normal trade  relations

with  Indonesia? Could the Minister  for  Commerce

and   Industry   tell  us?  This  already   famous

invisible trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



still continues but the people do not like to hear

of smuggling between Singapore and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any approach to bring in more raw materials is

most  welcome. Many of our rubber mills have  been

shut down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading local rubber mills like Lee Rubber, Nam

Lee,  Kah Hin have had to shut down completely  or

have been forced to operate part-time just to keep

them  going and to maintain the minimum employment

for its workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for our copra oil mills - when can we secure

sufficient copra to supply our coconut  oil  mills

in this country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of our soap factories, I am very happy

indeed to learn that the Minister for Commerce and

Industry  is going to introduce a Bill to  protect

our  local industries. We have not sufficient  raw

materials  to keep our soap factories running.  We

are faced with two evils - one is the tariff imposed

by  the  Federation of Malaya; and the other,  the

bigger  evil,  is  the  dumping  of  soap  by  our

neighbouring brother, the Federation. We know they

have  a  multi-million dollar capital,  and  their

dumping  of soap into Singapore is, if  I  am  not

mistaken, much worse than the dumping of  textiles

from  China.  We quickly placed a ban  on  Chinese

textiles when this happened, even though Singapore

is  without a single textile factory - if I  am  not

mistaken, these factories have already moved  from

Singapore  to  the Federation. Yet no  steps  have

been  taken to stop this dumping of soap from  the

Federation into Singapore, although we  have  many

soap factories of our own.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take off my hat to the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry, because he is going to introduce  a

Bill  in  time  to  protect our  fast  dying  soap

factories.  When we put two and two  together,  it

will  be  seen that the Minister for Commerce  and

Industry  has  very little to boast about  in  his

efforts  to  improve  the  trading  conditions  of

Singapore  in 1958. I am sure he has not  realised

his  ambition to bring about an improved state  of

affairs in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early this morning, I asked the Minister for

Commerce and Industry whether it is time  for  him

to  decide  on the question of a merger  with  the

Federation  of Malaya, and whether it is  possible

to  evolve a Pan-Malayan economic policy, and  how

he  is  going  to  maintain  Singapore's  entrepot

status. Well, really I do not know myself! It  may

either  be by co-operation with the Federation  of

Malaya  in our trade policy or we go along on  our

own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech on the motion for the Adjournment

dated  3rd December, 1958. I purposely touched  on

the  importance of trade with China. I  am  deeply

concerned  with the new amendments to the  Banking

Bill  in  the Federation of Malaya. One result  of

this new legislation has been the closing down  of

the Bank of China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask a straightforward question. Is

it  not  the  right  time now  for  the  Singapore

Government to declare that it will not follow  the

Federation of Malaya in closing down the  Bank  of

China  here? Singapore cannot follow suit, because

it  must  admit that its lifeline is its  entrepot

trade.  Even the Minister of Commerce and Industry

in  the  Federation of Malaya has openly  declared

that  Singapore's lifeline depends on its entrepot

trade. Singapore therefore cannot afford to create

animosity with any customer who wishes to trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider the year 1958 as the biggest failure

in our commerce, particularly regarding trade with

China.  Despite the good work done by the  Chinese

Chamber of Commerce in sending a Trade Mission  to

China in 1956 to improve our trade relations,  all

the good results achieved have been shattered, and

our  trade relationship with China has now reached

a dangerous point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my conclusion, I will confine myself to

these   considerations.   First,   the   Singapore

Government should make a clear-cut policy decision

as to what it will do in the event of a failure to

achieve  a  Pan-Malayan economic policy. Secondly,

how is Singapore going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



improve the trade relationship with Indonesia,  so

that  our raw material supplies from that  country

are not jeopardized? If there is co-operation with

our  neighbours in the economic field, we  can  be

assured that factories will spring up in Singapore

from  time  to time. There will be sufficient  raw

material supplies coming from Indonesia; also  our

exports  of piece-goods to Indonesia can  flourish

as the years pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the question of trade with China. Is it

the  policy  of  `this Government  to  follow  the

drastic  action taken by the Federation of  Malaya

which,  in the name of anti-Communism, has  closed

down  the Bank of China? If so, this is tantamount

to a breaking of trade relationship with China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not for a moment against merger with

the Federation of Malaya. What I am saying is that

now  is not the time to talk about merger.  It  is

better  to keep quiet. Talking and shouting  about

merger  has not brought about any reaction at  all

from  our brothers over the Causeway. We know that

the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya  is

a sincere and honest national leader. I would like

to  address  him  as "Bapak Merdeka",  as  do  the

people  in the territories of North Borneo, Brunei

and Sarawak. We should therefore not embarrass the

Tunku by pressing for a merger with the Federation

of Malaya now. The people there know too well that

Singapore cannot merge with the Federation at this

juncture, not with the present unstable conditions

prevailing in South-East Asia. However, they  feel

somewhat reluctant to tell Singapore that they  do

not  want a merger at the present time. The right-hand  man  of  the Federation Prime Minister,  the

Minister   of   Commerce  and  Industry   in   the

Federation, has already given an open  warning  to

the  M.C.A. that  no  merger  clause  should   be

included in the M.C.A. Constitution. But it is not

sufficient  for the Federation to hint  that  that

they  do not favour a merger. They should give  an

official  answer to the Singapore  Government  and

the people of Singapore - "No merger."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, based on these points, the Government should

face up to the facts courageously and confidently,

and  then  try  to  find a solution.  But  do  not

embarrass the Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul  Rahman.

Do   not   embarrass  the  Federation  of  Malaya.



However,  do not fall into the error of  accepting



the  popular slogan favoured by those who wish  to

champion  the  merger - that we can only  achieve  a

merger if we adopt Melayu as our lingua franca. We

must   not  allow  these  ambitious  and   selfish

politicians to fool us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, this is the right time for the

Singapore  Minister for Commerce and  Industry  to

speak  from his heart and tell the people  whether

Singapore  can stand alone or not. This morning  I

have  been criticised, "Oh, you only know  how  to

criticise, but you never put up a solution."  Sir.

I  have  mentioned this many times - why  cannot  we



declare  Singapore  an open city?  Why  cannot  we

raise money through the issue of industrial bonds?

The  Minister  for Commerce and Industry  has  had

letters referred to him from time to time  by  the

Immigration   Department  from   people   in   the

neighbouring countries of South-East Asia who have

plenty  of money to invest in Singapore. But  they

will only invest their money here if we grant them

permission to stay here permanently. However,  the

Minister for Commerce and Industry has always said

that,  unless these investors first invest in  our

local industry, he cannot issue a permanent permit

to  them  to  stay here. Sir, it is not sufficient

simply  to  ask foreign companies to invest  here.

Before  they  invest their money here,  they  will



first want to survey the market. Do you think they

will   have  confidence  in  Singapore   if   this

Government  is half-hearted? Merger or no  merger?

And  they know the Federation do not want a merger

at  the present time. It is an open secret. It  is

only  our  political leaders who try to hide  this

secret. They say we can achieve merger. We must be

patient  and keep quiet and not spoil the  chances

of a merger by rash actions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



You  just  adopt Melayu as the lingua  franca  and

then you will get a merger with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for the leaders to tell us once and

for  all that we can raise money; that we can make

Singapore  a  stable and the safest  city  in  the

East.   We   are  going  to  make  the  Federation

appreciate  the  value  of  this  great  port   of

Singapore. When this happens, the time will not be

too  late  to  say to the Federation that  we  are

ready  for a merger. If the Minister for  Commerce

and Industry has the courage; if he believes in  a

merger,  how  and when is he going to achieve  it?

For without a merger, we cannot have a Pan-Malayan

economic   policy;  and  without   a   Pan-Malayan

economic  policy, his Ministry  is  just  only  an

empty trunk.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before

replying  to  the few points raised  by  the  hon.

Member for Changi, which he took almost an hour to

deliver in today's debate, I will first touch upon

the  comments  made by the hon. Member  for  Telok

Ayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he took me to task for saying at the last

Assembly  sitting  that  I  could  not  understand

whether  he stood up for the old colonial form  of

government  or for the elected form of government.

He  said  that he mentioned only facts. But  as  I



understood him, his whole speech implied  that  in

the  old  colonial system of government, Singapore

had achieved a sound economy. But now, however, we

have  squandered  almost all the  money.  We  have

brought this island to the verge of bankruptcy  by

having  spent all the reserves. We have taxed  the

people  higher and so on. That sort  of  criticism

did imply that, comparing the former colonial form

of  government  with the present  Government,  the

former Govvernment was better. But, Sir, the point

at  issue  is this. The old Government might  have

built  up  a lot of reserves. They might not  have

imposed such a high rate of taxation on the people

who   could  be  taxed.  But  had  they   supplied

sufficient social services? Had there been at  any

time, before this Government took over, sufficient

schools  for the children of Singapore? Had  there

been  sufficient medical facilities for the people

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



Singapore?  Had there been sufficient unemployment

relief schemes and other similar social amenities?

Naturally  if  you  do not provide  enough  social

services,  you do not have to spend your reserves.

Neither  have  you  to impose  a  higher  rate  of



taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, in the previous Government, the

Chambers  of  Commerce  were  represented  in  the

Legislative Council. The Member himself  confessed

that he was twice returned to the old Council as a

representative of the Indian Chamber of  Commerce.

Well,  naturally, if a Councillor was representing



a  strong Chamber of Commerce, he would see to  it

that  the  rich people were not taxed. The  people

who  could  afford  to  pay  tax  were  not  taxed

heavily, and the Councillors did not care  if  the

poorer section of the community did not enjoy  the

benefits  of  social services  which  they  should

enjoy in a civilised community.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then referred to certain remarks made by me.

He said that a man in the position of the Minister



for  Commerce and Industry should be very  careful

of how he commented on things. Sir, he said that I

supported  the Luxury Tax Bill. I would  say  that

even now if we had no need for revenue, luxury tax

would  still be an equitable tax, because it would

be  a  tax that could be collected from those  who

can  afford to buy luxury goods. However,  it  was

not  because of my support of luxury tax that  the

confidence  of  the  merchants  had  ebbed   away,

because  they did not know when to hold stocks  of

goods  and  what  items were going  to  be  taxed.

Believe  me, a merchant is not so frail as  to  be



scared of talks of taxation. What he is scared  of

is  an  extreme left-wing government, and when  he

sees  that,  then there is no chance of  making  a

profit. But so long as he can make a profit, he is

never scared. He will take risks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member said that I had talked about

import duties. I deny that, Sir. At no time have I

ever talked about import duties. What I did was to

announce the Government's policy on protection  of

industries.  Protection  of  industries   can   be

achieved in two ways, as I have expounded in  this

House, by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



quantitative restrictions or by the imposition  of

tariffs. Now, imposition of tariffs cannot, by any

stretch of the imagination, be described as import

duties  because  import duties  specifically  mean

duties imposed to earn revenue. And it is not  the

intention  of this Government to use duties  as  a

source  of revenue. If we do impose tariffs,  they

are  only for the sake of protecting some  of  our

industries which are in a bad state at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member mentioned the cigarette

factory   and   the   Bill  in  Select   Committee

concerning it. Sir, there is no Bill in the Select

Committee about the cigarette factory, and  by  no

stretch  of  the imagination can I understand  how

the hon. Member for Telok Ayer could ever think of

a  Bill  in Select Committee which refers  to  the

cigarette factory. In fact, the Bill has not  even

been introduced yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ministry should safeguard the interests of

trade," he said. Exactly, and that is what we  are

doing. In fact, if the Ministry had not worked  as

hard  as  it  has - I will later on give  a  bit  of

recital  of  what  the Ministry has  done  and  is

doing - we  would have been much worse off  than  we

are today. Behind the scenes, the Ministry does  a

lot  of work - a lot of discussions and negotiations

go  on,  which the members of the public  are  not

aware  of,  because,  at  most  times,  we  cannot

disclose many of these negotiations. But  they  do

happen. However, I will give later on a small list

of some of the things that we have done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one main point that the hon. Member

raised - and  that is that he did not  criticise  my

Ministry,  as  he  said  previously,  for  obvious

reasons. I, Sir, have had to exercise a great deal

of restraint for obvious reasons too; but I always

welcome  constructive criticisms because I believe

in  the  democratic system, and  constructive  and

fair criticism is the essence of democracy. And  I

will always welcome any constructive criticisms - at

my  policies  but not at my person.  If  any  hon.

Member  thinks that my policies are wrong, he  has

every  right  to  criticise  them,  provided   the

criticism is constructive and not personal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, going on to the Member for Tanglin. He

did quote figures of employment previously, and he

also   mentioned  them  today  in  passing - figures

employed in industry - and he pointed out that these

figures   were  diminishing.  He  asked  me   what

progress  had  been  made in  the  setting  up  of

industries  in  Singapore. I will  give  him  some

figures which might possibly satisfy him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these are figures of registration and

closure of industrial companies:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, 74 industrial companies were registered;

75  closed  down. In 1956, 93 were registered;  54

closed  down.  In  1957, 140 were  registered;  58

closed down. Then there is a dip. In 1958, 78 were

registered, and I have not yet got the figures  of

those  closed  down. This is up to 30th  November,

1958. But I admit that there has been a dip and  I

will deal later with the reasons for this downward

trend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, some of the industries registered are quite

big.  They  include  the  manufacture  of  various

items. For instance, there is a company registered

with  a  million dollars, who are going  into  the

manufacturing   of  educational  and   advertising

films.  Probably the hon. Member is aware of  that

company.  There is another company going into  the

sawmill  industry.  There is another  one  with  a

million  dollars  dealing in  iron  foundries  and

mechanical  engineering.  A  half-million   dollar

company - brick        manufacturers.        Another

company - chemists and pharmacists - a  million-dollar

capital. Ice-cream and wafer manufacture, $300,000

capital.   Manufacturing  ready-mixed   concrete - a

million-dollar  capital,  and  so  on.   I   could

probably  go on and on. There are quite a  lot  of

such  companies  now. There are  no  multi-million

dollar  companies  that I can quote  of,  and  the

reason there, I come again -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I wonder if the Minister for

Commerce  and  Industry would be kind  enough  not

only  to  inform  us how many new industries  have

been  built  up, but also how many  factories  and

industries have been shut down?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have given figures for

1955,  1956,  and 1957 of those that  were  closed

down. For 1958 I am afraid I have not had time  to

get  those  figures and, therefore. I cannot  give

the  figures. It will be misleading if I just said

that  there  were very few shut downs,  because  I

myself have not got the figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason for the decline in industrial

development  is  three-fold, as I  explained  last

week in the Assembly. One is that there has been a

recession  and  that also applies to trade - decline

in  trade; secondly, there has been this political

uncertainty as to which political party  will  win

the  next  elections and that has acted as  a  big

restraining factor to those who wish  to  go  into

industry  because they would like  to  know  where

they  stand with the Government in power when  the

factories are going up. And the third big  factor,

of  course, as I always have said - and I have never

hidden this fact - is the Federation tariff. I  said

that even two years back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the hon. Member asked me about the

industrial   Promotion   Board.   The   Industrial

Promotion  Board  has  approved  loans   to   five

industries  out of which, I think, two have  taken

the  loans; the other three have not yet  complied

with  certain conditions under which loans can  be

made. I think one of them is probably waiting  for

machinery, and when it arrives, they will get  the

loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Promotion Board has so far not

sponsored  any  new  industry,  but  it  will   be

assisting the Government in the sponsoring of  the

cigarette  factory and other ventures to  which  I

shall come later.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another big industry which I had hoped

we  could  have  set  up last  year.  In  fact,  I

mentioned  two  or  three at  last  year's  Budget

sittings.  One  was a flour mill. Sir,  they  have

still  not made up their minus, because what  they

want  is  protection from competing flour imports,

and,  frankly,  I  am not prepared  to  give  that

protection.  Flour is a basic commodity  which  is

used  for  good purposes and I am not prepared  to

give  a monopoly on flour to anyone, because  they

could  then  force the price up and your  loaf  of

bread  would cost you more. That is what has  been

holding  them  back.  Then  there  was  the  sugar

industry  which I had hoped would  utilise  a  big

capital  of  five  or  six  million  dollars.  The

sponsors  tried  their very  best  to  find  local

capital  to go into partnership, but local capital

was  not forthcoming, and that was the end of  the

venture.  We  had  even gone  as  far  as  finding

suitable  land  for  them,  giving  them  all  the

facilities,  and making arrangements  for  leasing

this  land  at reasonable terms. But because  they

could not find local capital to participate,  they

were  not  willing  to come  in  with  their  full

foreign capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third one, Sir, is a big tuna project. That I

have  been  doing my best to promote. I  have  had

preliminary  talks on this project  two  or  three

times.  My  Permanent Secretary,  on  his  way  to

Seattle to attend a Colombo Plan conference,  also

stopped over in Tokyo and had further discussions,

and  recently  they  came  here  and  had  further

discussions.  That  would be a  $2,000,000  scheme

with  joint  local capital. Now, the  question  is

whether  local  capital can  be  found.  If  local

private  capital  is available,  that  scheme  may

materialise, probably next year. They will have to

build   factories,  ice  plants,  and  a   canning

factory. But the whole project revolves round  the

availability of local private capital. If that  is

not  forthcoming,  probably that  scheme  may  not

materialise, because they are not keen  to  go  in

entirely by themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the cigarette factory, Sir, the hon.

Member  asked  me what I have done.  If  the  hon.

Member had only contained his curiosity for a  day

longer, he would have seen in tomorrow's Order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



Paper  that  I  have given notice  of  a  Bill  to

incorporate  the People's Investment  Corporation,

and   it  will  be  introduced  tomorrow  morning.

Therefore, I am afraid since it is going to be the



subject of a debate at a later date, I will not be

allowed  by  you, Mr Speaker, Sir, to  anticipate

the  debate at this stage, and therefore I refrain

from speaking further on that subject today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we come to the hon. Member for Changi.

He   belaboured  the  point  that  a   Pan-Malayan



economic  unit  is  not  possible,  and  that  the

Federation is not going to accept the concept of a

Pan-Malayan  economic  unit.  I,  Sir,  am  in  no

position  to anticipate what the Federation  might

do  or  might not do. At the moment, I agree  that

they  have  not  accepted the concept  of  a  Pan-Malayan economic unit. But that does not rule  out

the possibility that in a few months' time or in a

year's  time, they may come round to believing  in

the  concept  of a Pan-Malayan economic  unit  and

accepting it. The fact that they have not done  so

need  not  necessarily put us in  an  antagonistic

attitude  towards Malaya, because that  would  not

serve  anybody's  purpose. In fact,  it  would  be

detrimental to both. We, Sir, believe in extending

to  the Federation of Malaya co-operation wherever

we  can  and  telling  them frankly,  whenever  we

cannot, "We cannot do it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The co-operation we gave them on the banning of

certain   Chinese  textiles  was  on  the   strict

understanding  that  that  was  for  a   temporary

period,  and I said so in my reply; and I repeated

it  twice in this Assembly two weeks' back.  I  am

going  to review the situation at the end of  this

month,  and  I do not think, therefore,  that  any

purpose  will be served by belabouring that  point

any further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the trade figures. Hon. Members

must  admit that trade has gone up and up  and  up

and that it is only this year that trade is coming

down; and I know the reasons why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just quote the figures first. For 1951,

which was the boom year due to the Korean War, the

total  trade  was $7,610,000,000. If hon.  Members

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



not  read  them, the trade figures are:  In  1952,

$5,393,000,000; 1953 $4,305,000,000; 1954

$4,505,000,000; 1955 $5,647,000,000; 1956

$5,831,000,000; 1957 $6,050,000,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1957 was the best trading year in Singapore's

history,  barring 1951, and 1956  was  the  second

best,  barring 1951. In 1958, trade  has  taken  a

dip.    January/October    1958    figures    show

$4,676,000,000 as compared to January/October last

year  at $5,116,000,000. Trade has taken  a  dip,

and  the  reason for it is because the effects  of

the  recession  in the United States,  which  were

felt  world-wide, are being felt in  Singapore - but

at  a  later stage. We always feel the effects  of

any recession, or boom, not immediately but always

later, because of our peculiar economic situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the dip in trade has been due to the

fact   that   exports  of  tin  have  been   under

restriction  by  the International Tin  Agreement.

Tin exports are curtailed now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, as I have pointed out to this House

on  various occasions, what worries me is not that

the  trade figures have not gone up, but that  the

export  figures have not kept pace. I  have  drawn

the  attention of hon. Members many times to  this

situation, that our deficit is increasing. In 1955

our deficit was $83,000,000; that is, imports were

in  excess of exports by $83,000,000.    In  1956,

the deficit was $366,000,000; in 1957 the deficit

was   $504,000,000.  That  means  that  we   are

consuming  more  and more. We are  importing  much

more than we are exporting. In 1958, I am sure the

deficit will be greater than in 1957. Now that  is

what I do not like frankly.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I have always been trying to show as

a  danger  mark. I know the hon. Member for  Telok

Ayer  has been President of the Indian Chamber  of

Commerce   for  several  years.  He   has   always

belaboured the point in this House that trade must

be free. There should be no restrictions on trade.

Sir, with due respect to him, that is an old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



school  of  thought, a school of thought  which  I

once  described as "those who have  not  seen  the

writing  on the wall". Sir, there must  now  be  a

reorientation of ideas. We know for  certain  that

trade will go on at that level possibly, but there

is  no  possibility  of increasing  trade,  unless

there  are some emergency circumstances,  such  as

the  Korean situation in 1951. Therefore, we  have

to  find  some other economic factors  which  will

take  care of our increasing population.  That  is

why I am trying to encourage industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you see in the newspapers every day? Take

today's Straits Times, for instance:



<br><br><div align="center"><b>"American company opens local office</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westinghouse Electric International Co., of

America,   has  now  established  an   office   in

Singapore,   in  order  to  expand  its   business

activities  in  the Colony and the  Federation  of

Malaya."



<br><br>Then lower down the page:



<br><br><div align="center"><b>"French company plans to double its car sales".</b></div>



<br><br>Sir,  every  day  you will find  various  concerns

trying to expand their sales here, and those sales

are  not  for  entrep�t but for local consumption.

With  a high-pressure sales campaign, you are made

to increase your wants. You buy more and more, but

you  do  not  sell more and more, with the  result

that  you have got a lopsided economy. As for  the

merchant,  Sir, with due respect to him,  he  does

not  care tuppence what happens to the economy  so

long  as  he can go on unrestricted and  make  his

profit.  But he shouts if his income tax  goes  up

and  if  he  has  got to cough up a  part  of  his

profit.  The hon. Member for Telok Ayer represents

that  sort of opinion. Many of the big firms  have

agencies  for  goods, and if we  manufacture  them

here  and  give them protection, these firms  will

lose  the  market  because the imported  goods  of

which they are the agents will not be allowed,  or

they  will  be  subject to tariff, and  the  firms

cannot   sell  them  openly  and  make  a  profit.

Therefore, Sir, they fight me hard. I  know  I  am



very unpopular in certain business circles, but  I

look to the interests of Singapore, Sir,I do  not

care if I tread on somebody's toes, even though he

is a "big gun" in the commercial world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ever read in the newspapers of somebody

coming out with an intensified buying campaign for

Singapore  and Malaya? Now most of the goods  that

are  sold  to us are not for entrep�t  trade,  but

they  are for local consumption. I do not say that

there is anything wrong in what they are trying to

do - that is quite normal commercial practice - but it

is  bad  for our economy if you buy more and  more

and  you  cannot  sell  more  and  more.  But  the

merchant does not care, so long as he can buy  and

sell  and  make  his profit, whether  somebody  is

exporting  more or not. It is the Government  that

has  got  to take care of the balance of payments,

and  in no country do you have a government  which

does not take care of the balance of payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said two weeks back in this House that we

are  living in a cold, hard and competitive world.

You  will  see  allies, not only in the  political

field, but also in the military field fighting one

another. Today's Free Press has this headline:



<br><br><div align="center"><b>"U.K. bid to avert trade war starts bitter clash</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British and French ministers clashed in the

Council  of the Organisation for European Economic

Co-operation in Paris...".



<br><br>The  whole  idea of getting colonies and  fighting

wars  is to obtain a better economic standard  for

your  people.  Therefore, when  it  comes  to  the

question of economy, even old friends - friends  who

have  fought  side  by side with  each  other - will

clash,  to  try and get the better of each  other.

That  is what happens, Sir. Can you blame me, Sir,



if  the  Federation think of their economy  first?

You cannot also blame them for that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member asked me, "Can the Minister

honestly  tell us whether entrep�t  trade  can  be

maintained?" I have said many times honestly  that

the  entrep�t trade increase cannot be maintained,

and  if  the hon. Member will refer to the Hansard

of two years back, he will find it there. I am not

trying  to shield myself, Sir. That is the  actual

position today, and I have said it often and quite

openly.  Then  he said. "How can the Minister  say

that  if  there is no merger with the  Federation,

then we die?" I never said we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



die, Sir; we will not die, but our economic future

will  not be bright. What are we going to do  with

that surplus population that is increasing year by

year?   We  cannot  absorb  them  in  trade:   the

industrial expansion is not big enough to  do  so.

So  what  do  we do? If we are one unit  with  the



Federation,   probably  some   of   this   surplus

population could settle down there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said some politicians would

promise anything to be returned to power.  Sir,  I

have  not  done that. I have openly and truthfully

stated  that we have a bad economic future  facing

us. If I wanted, I could say, "Everything is dandy

in our camp. We are all right." I can paint a rosy

picture and get everyone to clap and say, "What  a

good  Minister!  So much has been achieved."  That

will  pave  the way for getting myself  re-elected

easier. But I have painted a gloomy picture in the

past,  even  at  the  risk  of  being  called   an

alarmist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have explained why the entrepot trade is

bad.  It  is  not  because of the  fault  of  this

Government.  The  hon.  Member  asked,  "Did   the

Government   negotiate  to  improve  international

trade?  Why  cannot  we  have  normal  trade  with

Indonesia?" At this stage, I may take a bit of the

time  of the Assembly to say something about  what

my  Ministry has been doing in this respect.  Hon.

Members  will recollect that I led a trade mission



to  Indonesia  in  October 1955 and  that  we  did

initial  an  agreement between our  side  and  the

Indonesian  side which was to be ratified  by  the

Cabinets of both sides within three or four months

of  the initialling. However, before that could be

done,   there  was  a  change  in  government   in

Indonesia  and nothing came out of the  agreement.

Then about a couple of months back an official  of



my  Ministry  went to Indonesia and  had  informal

discussions   there   with   various    government

officials and trade and commercial leaders.  As  a

result, the Indian Chamber of Commerce decided  to

send  a trade mission to Indonesia in December  in

which  the Singapore Chamber of Commerce  and  the

Chinese   Chamber  of  Commerce  were   going   to

participate.  However, later on we  came  to  know

that   there  was  not  much  response  from   the

Indonesian side, and so the mission was postponed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will also remember that when certain

vessels  were detained at Pulau Samboe  and  other

places  early this year, it was my Ministry  which

took  up the matter very strongly, and as a result

several vessels were released, I think in February

or March. Again, Sir, the Scudai, the Hong Tat and

a  Siamese vessel from Pulau Samboe were  released

because  we took up the matter with the Indonesian

Consulate-General here. We are constantly in touch

with  the  Indonesian  Consulate-General  here  on

trade. For instance, barter trade: Sir, when there

was  some  trouble between the merchants here  and

those on the other side in the log trade, we tried

to  smoothen matters out. We have succeeded  in  a

lot  of  instances when difficulties arose between

both sides. There are times when we cannot release

this  sort of news, because neither side wants  it

to be released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken up through our Trade

Commissioner in the United Kingdom the question of

freight  on  timber,  copra  and  coconut  oil  at

various  times  and  we have partly  succeeded  in

getting a reduction in the freight on copra.  Sir,

the hon. Mr Tan Siak Kew knows about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken up the question of the customs

duty on coconut oil in the United Kingdom, but  we

have  not succeeded in getting a reduction of that

duty.  But  there  again  it  is  a  question   of

unfairness. Coconut oil from Singapore has to  pay

a  non-preferential rate when it enters the United

Kingdom. That was not so in 1950, but after  that,

they  suddenly decided on a non-preferential rate.

All we could do is to write to them, to appeal  to



them, and to negotiate with them; but if one  side

is not willing to come down, what are you going to

do  about it? You have got to take it lying  down,

because there is no other way out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member expressed his happiness at

my   introducing  measures  to  protect  the  soap

industry;  but what I can gather from the  earlier

part of his speech is that he was against any sort

of  protection  or any sort of impediment  to  the

free flow of trade. So I was rather surprised when

he said that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



was  happy that I was going to introduce  measures

to  protect  the  soap industry. Sir,  that  is  a

question   that   is  being  considered   by   the

Protection  Advisory Committee now, and  I  cannot

anticipate     their    findings     nor     their

recommendations  to me. But that  is  certainly  a

matter which is being considered. In fact, we have

received  applications from  about  eight  parties

altogether on different items for protection,  and

all of them are being attended to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that my Ministry has nothing

to boast of for 1958. Sir, I have never boasted. I

have  worked, and I can say this without boasting,

that  if  my officials had not worked as  hard  as

they  have,  there  might  probably  have  been  a

further  fall  in trade, because the  negotiations

which  they  had carried out might not have  borne

fruit;  in  which  case the assistance  which  was

given to trade would not have been there and as  a

result  there  would have been a decline  in  that

particular trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member asked me, "If the Minister

fails to achieve a Pan-Malayan economic unit - which

is  an ideal - what will he do?" Sir, I have said  a

couple  of  weeks back that I do  not  believe  in

letting  things slide. I believe in fighting  hard

to  survive,  and all the measures  which  I  have

introduced in this House - the protection policy  on

which,  incidentally, a Bill has been  introduced;

the  Customs  (Amendment No. 3)  Bill,  which  was

introduced  on  12th December, 1958;  the  Pioneer

Industries Bill; the Industrial Expansion Bill and

so  on - are designed to meet a situation  where  we

have to stand on our own feet. The effect of these

Bills  will  be felt, probably not today  or  next

year,   but  a  couple  of  years  hence,  because

developing an industry is not something  that  can

be  achieved overnight. It takes time. A  man  who

thinks   today  of  starting  an  industry   would

probably have his factory ready after three years.

First  he has to make a market survey; he  has  to



find  out  about  his  raw materials,  labour  and

various  other factors; and he has got to  satisfy

himself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



that  the Government in power - or if there is going

to  be  a change in government in the near future,

that  the government coming in would be favourable

to  his  industry.  It is only then,  when  he  is

satisfied  with  all the angles,  that  he  starts

taking  concrete steps to set up an industry.  The

ordering  of  machinery and putting  up  buildings

will take another year at least.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my main point is this, Sir, that we must try

and stand on our own feet, and the only solution I

can  see  is to try and industrialise as  much  as

possible. Now there will be a conflict between the

trading  interests  and the  industrial  expansion

interests. That is bound to occur. That is  why  I

have  stressed selective protection.  We  have  to

balance the two - which is the more beneficial to us

in that particular item. There cannot be a rule of

thumb procedure in such matters.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the last point that the hon. Member made was,

"Will the Government declare its policy about  the

Bank of China and whether it is going to close  it

down?"  I  am not aware, Sir, that the  Government

has ever said anything about closing down the Bank

of China, and I do not see from where the fears of

the hon. Member arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, Sir, which the Member for

Tanglin raised, and that is, he mentioned that the

Pioneer  Industries  and the Industrial  Expansion

Bills  have  been  approved by this  Assembly  and

asked  how  many new industries are  going  to  be

opened up. Firstly, those Bills have not yet  been

approved  by this Assembly. They only have  passed

their  Second  Reading and they have not  received

their  Third Reading and will not receive it until

14th  January, 1959. So they have not passed  into

law  yet.  Therefore, you cannot have applications

under those Bills yet. However, in anticipation of

those   measures,  I  have  received  about  eight

applications and we have replied telling  them  to

await  the  passing of the Bills. We  cannot  tell

them yes or no at this stage, because,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



legally, once the Bills become law, they  have  to

apply   under  the  law;  and  there  are  certain

procedures  which the Minister has to  carry  out,

such  as  gazetting and so on, and  therefore  the

Minister cannot prejudge the issue and say,  "Yes,

when the Bills become law, I will give you pioneer

industry  status."  That  is  not  right  for  the

Minister  to  do. Sir, we have told them  to  hold

their  horses  and to apply only  when  the  Bills

become law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, if I am not mistaken,

the   Minister  for  Commerce  and  Industry   has

categorically admitted that (1) the entrep�t trade

of  Singapore  cannot  be maintained:  (2)  he  is

determined  to introduce protection  measures  not

only  for  the  soap industry but also  for  other

selective industries; (3) the Singapore Government

will  definitely  not  follow  the  Federation  of

Malaya in taking drastic measures against the Bank

of China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it would be quite unfair of me to

give such a lengthy criticism of this Ministry and

never make any constructive suggestions. So I have

these suggestions to put forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is it difficult for this Government to

negotiate  with the Federation of Malaya,  to  sit

down  at a table quietly to plan and agree on what

type  of  industries the Federation of Malaya  are

going to promote and what type of industries  they

will  allow Singapore to carry on with?  In  other

words, if the Federation of Malaya decide to carry

on with the textile industry, then in an agreement

let  the  Federation of Malaya supply textiles  to

Singapore  and  Singapore must not  allow  textile

factories  to be set up. If the Federation  decide

that   Singapore  can  carry  on  with  the  light

industries,  for example, matches, then  Singapore

can carry on and Singapore matches will be allowed

to  be  imported  into  the Federation  of  Malaya

without  any tariff, and the Federation of  Malaya

also will not set up any match factories. In other

words,   although  politically  we  cannot   merge

straightaway - it  is  a long-term  policy -  what  I

would  like  to  emphasise  is  that  politically,

economically  and historically,  we  must  be  one

unit. Unfortunately, not at our own wish, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



have  been cut into two, but at least what I  have

suggested  can  be achieved. So  the  question  is

whether  the  Minister for Commerce  and  Industry

will  be able to approach the Federation of Malaya

and  come  to  an agreement to develop  particular

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second suggestion is to raise money

which  is  badly  needed to  boost  up  industrial

promotion. How are we going to raise the money? We

should  not rely only on our chicken feed national

revenue,  but  we can find other  means.  I  think

quite a number of countries, even those as rich as

Britain   and   America,   have   industrial    or

development bonds. The bond issues will be  for  a

particular  industrial development. Sir,  we  must

fully utilise Singapore's position today. When the

unemployment  problem is brought up,  many  people

think   the   solution  is  to  merge   with   the

Federation,  and  then our  people  can  get  into

Malaya.  But,  Sir,  many Federation  workers  are

seeking jobs here, and many Federation businessmen

like  to  invest  in real property  in  Singapore.

Singapore is nearest to the Federation of  Malaya.



How  about Indonesia, Thailand, Hongkong  and  the



Philippines?   There   are  many,   many   wealthy

businessmen   who,  either  for  racial   conflict

reasons,   racial   discrimination   reasons,   or

political  reasons, become refugees and they  seek

every way to set up a permanent home, and they are

more  practical than our people in Singapore. They

know  that Singapore will remain quite long  under

the  Union  Jack, and therefore there is political

safety  at  least  in  Singapore.  So  many,  many

wealthy men seek to settle down in Singapore.  And

if  I am not mistaken, many applications have been

in  the  hands  of the Minister for  Commerce  and

Industry and if they can conform to the conditions

laid  down  for setting up industries  here,  then

they can be accepted and their applications for  a

permit  to  stay here permanently can  be  issued.

Therefore,  Sir, if the Government can issue  such



bonds,  they  can  use the money for  development.

Many times I have quarrelled with the Ministry  of



Labour   and  Welfare  which  is  in   charge   of

immigration. It is quite stupid to say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



"As soon as you have set up an industrial factory,

then  I can issue you a permit for permanent stay.

You  can bring in as many wives as you want."  But



these  people  are not sure that,  after  settling

down  here,  they can sell their factory  if  they

have to. So the purpose of encouraging the setting

up  of  industries here goes like a circle,  round

and  round  and round. Sir, if the Government  can

fully  and wisely utilise the situation and  issue

industrial  or  development bonds then  I  do  not

think  there  would be any difficulty  at  all  of

getting  many investors to come here,  because  (I

would   like  to  be  straightforward)  they   are

refugees from the unstable neighbouring countries.

But  we  must make sure that those bonds  are  not



transferable. If they have faith in this  country,

if  they want to enjoy the benefits of our  social

services in this country, then those bonds  cannot

be  transferred.  If you buy a certain  amount  of

bonds, your permanent stay permit can be granted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I earnestly and sincerely put forward these

suggestions  in support of what the  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry has promised - that  we  are

going to stand firm and we are going to fight  for

survival alone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore

will  be better off if it is part of the whole  of

Malaya as one political and economic unit, but  as

far as we know, it is not going to be possible for

some  time  to come, because of many factors,  the

main  thing  being  the  political  situation   in

Singapore. When we talk about Singapore we  always

recall  to  our minds that it is an  entrepot,  it

lives  on trade, and that is why a great  deal  of

discussion has taken place from this morning until

now,  centering on the most important  subject  of

this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want Members of this Assembly to note

that  Singapore,  by  itself, must  adopt  certain

attitudes if it is going to survive. It is just  a

middleman.  From  the  West,  we  have   the   big

countries to supply us with goods. Around  us,  we

have   other  countries  supplying  us  with   raw

materials. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



are  a  centre for distributing manufactured goods

to  them. We are in a very vulnerable position. If

the West or the big manufacturing countries refuse

to co-operate, we cannot survive. If the countries

around  us are going to ship direct to the various

manufacturing countries, we too will lose a  great

deal  of our trade. No matter what it is, we  have

to  think  clearly what we must  do  in  order  to

retain our position here as the middleman.  It  is

easy to say, "Let us encourage entrepot trade. Let

us encourage manufacture." But all this will be of

no  avail if the other countries are going  to  go

out of their way to sabotage us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just quote one important section of this.

I  will  talk  about shipping. I have always  been



interested in shipping and I have always said that

it  is the most important line that we must depend

on.  We  know that goods may be shipped  from  the

West  to Singapore to be distributed to South-East

Asia,  but  if  the big shipping lines  under  the

control of the nations of the West are going to by-pass Singapore, then we will not have the entrepot

trade  that  we are now having. There  will  be  a

ganging-up  of  all  these shipping  companies  in

order  to make sure that their interests  are  not

affected. I will also say this. If you ask what is

the  freight from Singapore to the United Kingdom,

you  will be quoted a certain rate. If you ask for

the  freight rate from, say, Borneo to the  United

Kingdom,  it  will not be a great  deal  more.  In

fact,  it  will be much cheaper. They do  it  this

way.  It  is  not possible for the large  shipping

lines  to  send large ships to the small countries

in  South-East  Asia  to collect  enough  freight.

Therefore  they  make  use  of  Singapore   as   a



collecting centre.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freight from Borneo, Sarawak or any of the

neighbouring countries to Singapore will  be  done

by  the subsidiary lines. They can pass the  goods

on  to them. They handle it for the large shipping

companies and, all in all, the cost is less.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, in this instance, is being made use of

by  these  large  shipping  lines  for  their  own

interests! The large shipping companies,  to  make

sure  that  no  shipping  lines  should  establish

themselves  firmly  in Singapore,  undercut  their

rates. They tell the shippers of their goods, "You

have  to  ship  with  the  companies  we  appoint,

otherwise we shall not accept your goods at  these

reduced  rates."  Now this hits  at  the  existing

industry - our local shipping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, many other ways whereby the

West can force Singapore to render service to them

without repaying this island anything at all. If a

company refused to do what they tell them  to  do,

they   would   gang  up,  get  the   manufacturers

together,  and  say, "We will  cut  you  off  from

there."  I  remember a story that was said  before

the  war  about  a  large  European  company  that

stifled the growth of a local company. This  local

company  was going to import goods and  distribute

everyday-use  wares imported from  Australia.  The

local  company knew that the goods  were  sold  at

very high profits and that they could make-do with

even  lesser  profit and yet reap a good  harvest.

They started a company. First, this large European



company  informed the suppliers, "You are  not  to

supply goods to this company. If you do, we  shall

boycott  you:  we  shall not buy from  you."  Some

companies  agreed  and  withdrew  supplies.  Other

little companies kept on supplying, so it was  not

quite  effective.  They went a step  further.  The

director of the large European company also had an

interest  in shipping companies and he, therefore,

told  the shippers, "You must not carry any  goods

supplied  to this company in your ships; otherwise

we  will boycott your ships." In that manner  they

were  able  to  stifle  the growth  of  the  local

company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking about this, Sir, because I feel that

there  are only two ways whereby we can  keep  our

own  entrepot trade. The first way is to  be  very

courteous and polite to all the people around  us,

to  do  what all the manufacturers want us to  do,

and make whatever profit they permit us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



to  make.  The  second way  is  to  adopt  a  more

independent attitude and say, "If you are going to

compete   with   us,  we  will  put   up   stiffer

opposition, and we will try to help ourselves." We

have one reason why they must rely on us, and that

is   that,   geographically,  we   are   centrally

situated.  We  have  good  port  facilities   that

attract  the sending of goods to us. If the  large

shipping  lines  are going to undercut  our  local

trade,  then we can say we will put up our storage

and  handling fees for the transhipment of  goods,

and  we will help our local shipping companies  to

establish   themselves.  Shipping  is   the   most

important  industry  in  Singapore.  If   we   can

establish  a  Singapore-owned network of  shipping

running  regularly throughout the whole of  South-East  Asia,  we  will be able to face  up  to  the

competition  from  the West. We  can  do  that  by

giving  our own local shipping protection  in  the

matter  of handling at our harbour here.  Then  we

have  a  system that is ready for distribution  of

goods  or for the collection of goods. If  we  are

not  able  to  do  that, then we  must  adopt  the

attitude of kowtowing to all around.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are manufacturing companies in the West, powerful

organizations  that  almost  dictate  policies  to

their  Government, going to help us? No, they  are

only  utilizing us for their own ends! I think  to

adopt  the  attitude of becoming more  independent

and  more  self-reliant would be better,  and  the

Ministry of Commerce and Industry should encourage

this  form  of  shipping. There are  a  few  local

shipping  companies in Singapore.  They  have  put

forward  their complaints to the Minister,  asking

him  to  help them so that they may not go out  of

business.  I think the Minister should  help  them

seriously,  because  if  he  does  not,  then  our

network   of  supplies  and  transport  would   be

jeopardized.  I feel that this network  should  be

further strengthened by the addition of more ships

to  our  own shipping companies, by expanding  the

routes so that they not only ply between Singapore

and Hongkong, Borneo and Sarawak, but also ply  as

far  down  as  Australia. If  they  can  do  that,

possibly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



with  Government help, even make it like  the  one

proposed   by   the  Minister  for  Commerce   and

Industry - a  local  cigarette  factory  with  local

interests  in it - it will help our local trade:  it

will help our entrepot trade. Short of that, there

is no remedy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly feel, Sir, that only after that is

established can we consider other measures to help

ourselves. One of these would be what the Minister

has   told   us - the  establishment  of   factories

locally.  And  if we are going to establish  those

factories locally, we will face competition  again

from  the  West. They will not let let  us  go  at

that.  They will dump their goods here. You  might

say that China has dumped goods here. But you also

have  evidence  of  European companies  in  Malaya

dumping  goods  here,  in  order  to  kill   local

industries.  If  we  have  local  companies  which

affect  the  interests of the West, I  know  these

European companies will also dump their goods here

in  order that these local companies may be killed

and that they will have a clear field for all that

they manufacture. We are only called upon to do  a

job  for  them. If we do not fulfil their purpose,

then  they will cut us off. It is clear to us that

because  we have not been co-operating very  fully

with them, they are trying to cut off part of  our

trade and they are going to use Hongkong and other

ports  for  their purpose. Instead of transhipping

in Singapore, they are transhipping from Hongkong.

Although  the distance involved will  be  further,



yet  they  are happier because Singapore  will  be

brought  to  her knees and will have to co-operate

with  them! The Minister should fully realise  the

intentions of these people, and measures should be

taken so that our local people are assisted in all

possible   ways  in  order  that  they  may   help

Singapore to retain its prosperity. An answer from

the Minister will oblige.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

hon. Member for Serangoon this: "How much does one

ocean-going  steamer cost?"  Can  he  give  me  an

answer to that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

what the Member for Telok Ayer, the President  (or

office-bearer) of the Indian Chamber of  Commerce,

was  talking about when he asked for the  cost  of

one  ocean-going steamer. Nothing  in  this  world

starts off with a big bang. Everything must  start

in  a natural way. I would just like to ask him  a

question in reply to his, "What is the capital  of

his company?"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think that is completely

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> All right, Sir. I would say,

take  any  big firm in Singapore that is  locally-owned.  What I know is that they came to Singapore

with  just a basket and a change of clothes. Today

they  may  be  millionaires or multi-millionaires.

Things can be done that way.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I forgot to mention

earlier  that  we  had carried out  a  preliminary

survey of industries. We were so encouraged by the

results of the survey that we are now carrying out

a  full-fledged  survey  of  industries,  covering

nearly  700 industrial and manufacturing  concerns

each  employing 10 persons or over. We  expect  to

complete  this  survey in two  months'  time.  The

survey  has  indicated  possibilities  of  further

expansion  of  a  number  of  industries  and  the

assistance required from Government so that  these

industries could expand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to soap, Sir. Soap production has gone up,

in  fact.  The figures are: January /August  1955,

173,000  cwt.;  the same period for 1956,  170,000

cwt.; the same period for 1957, 165,000 cwt.;  and

the  same  period  for  1958,  199,000  cwt.  Sir,

actually soap production has gone up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming to the point raised by the hon. Member

for  Changi:  first, is it difficult to  negotiate

with  the  Federation of Malaya on what industries

they  should  have and what industries  we  should

have?  I  answered  him, Sir,  that  we  have  had

negotiations  with  them.  We  have  raised   this

question before with them, and I am sorry  to  say

at this stage, Sir, that it has not yet been found

possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



to  have  a formula of that sort. The hon.  Member

must realise that the question of merger is more a

political question than an economic one.  Then  he

raised the point whether we could issue industrial

development bonds to raise money for industries. I

do  not  think that the rich persons in  Singapore

are  anxious  to invest in such bonds  which  only

yield  5, 6, 7, or 8 per cent. They want to go  in

for bigger profits; but it would be tantamount  to

selling  immigration permits to refugees who  have

got  money -  if you force them, "You  buy  half  a

million  dollars worth of bonds, and you will  get

an  immigration permit." That is not the right way

to trade on your immigration permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the expansion of shipping - the point

raised   by  the  hon.  Member  for  Serangoon - our

companies are still too small to undertake  longer

voyages, but I hope in time they will expand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> May I, Sir, just make a point

of clarification? I have not suggested the selling

of our immigration permits. I only said that since

they  have applied for a permit for permanent stay

here  and have also promised to invest their money

here,  why should we not utilize that promise  and

get them to buy government issue bonds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I asked the Minister for

Commerce  and  Industry  what  measures   he   had

regarding shipping and I have no answer to that as

yet.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I beg to report that the Committee

of  Supply have made progress on the Appropriation

Bill and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tomorrow it will be.
