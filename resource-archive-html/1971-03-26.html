<div align="center"><b>BUILDINGS IN EXCESS OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>900 SQUARE FEET</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Building plans)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law and National Development if he will consider waiving

the  Chief  Building Surveyor's  requirement  of  a

registered   architect's  building  plan   for   an

existing or new temporary building of more than 900

square feet; and if he will consider requesting the

Chief   Building  Surveyor's  Department  to   sell

standardised building plans for a three-room  house

of  more than 900 square feet to the people in  the

rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, building by-laws provide that sketch building plans may be

accepted  for  erection of temporary  houses  of  a

floor  area  not exceeding 750 square  feet.  Where

this  area  is exceeded, this restriction  has  not

been  applied too rigidly. In many cases where  the

floor   plan  submitted  for  a  dwelling  is   for

accommodation  of a single family unit,  the  Chief

Building Surveyor allows the use of sketch building

plans  for the erection of buildings even in excess

of   900   square   feet,  without   requiring   an

architect's  building  plan,  provided   that   the

structure is a simple structure and that  the  span

of  the  roof  trusses does not  exceed  the  usual

permissible length of about 20 feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the sale of standardised building

plans for a three-room house of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



more  than  900  square feet  in  area,  the  Chief

Building  Surveyor is presently  looking  into  the

matter,  and  it  is  hoped  to  make  these  plans

available for sale to the public very soon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>POULTRY SHEDS IN EXCESS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF 900 SQUARE FEET</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Waiving of building plan requirements)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development  if  he  is  aware   that   a

temporary poultry shed which covers an area of more

than 900 square feet requires a building plan to be

drawn   up   by   a  registered  architect   before

consideration for its approval can be made  by  the

Chief  Building Surveyor's Department;  and  if  he

will take steps to have this requirement waived and

to   allow   the   Primary  Production   Department

Veterinary   Extension  Centre   to   handle   such

applications.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, poultry sheds are

not  always small structures. Some of them are more

than 25 feet wide, 100 feet long, and 15 feet high.

The  covered area of the shed is not the  criterion

used  in determining whether architect's plans  are

required. The main consideration is the span of the

roof  truss  and its design. If, in the opinion  of

the  Building Surveyor, the service of an architect

is  required to ensure structural safety,  he  will

advise the applicant to engage an architect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Primary Production has drawn up

standardised  plans  for  poultry  sheds.   Poultry

farmers who wish to dispense with the service of an

architect  for erection of poultry sheds in  excess

of  900 square feet in area, should make use of the

standardised  plans  prepared by  the  Director  of

Primary  Production  which  conform  with  all  the

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development is presently

considering transferring the control of erection of

temporary  farm structures from the Chief  Building

Surveyor's Department to the Primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



Production Department. Details are being worked out

between the two departments.

<div align="center"><b>HAWKERS' CENTRE AT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>JALAN TENTERAM</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Facilities for motorists)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and  National Development if it is planned  to

provide  car parking facilities along, and  bridges

across, the canal adjacent to the proposed Hawkers'

Centre to be built near Block 8, Jalan Tenteram, as

those  facilities  will help to bring  in  business

from motorists going along Jalan Toa Payoh.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Sir, it is considered undesirable to

provide  car parking facilities along, and  bridges

across, the canal adjacent to the proposed Hawkers'

Centre to be built near Block 8, Jalan Tenteram, to

link up with Jalan Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Jalan Toa Payoh will in due course form part

of  the  proposed  Pan-Island Expressway,  and  our

traffic  experts  are  against  allowing  too  many

ingresses and egresses to and from the expressway.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RECREATIONAL PARK ON LAND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BETWEEN ST. MICHAEL'S ESTATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND JALAN TOA PAYOH</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and  National Development if it is planned  to

build  a  recreational park on the land  along  the

canal  between St. Michael's Estate and  Jalan  Toa

Payoh.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Sir, I regret to say that there are

no  plans to build a recreational park on the  land

along  the  canal between St. Michael's Estate  and

Jalan  Toa Payoh. The reason is that most  of  this

land  is  a reserve for drainage. In fact, part  of

the land is being used as an access to the canal in

order  that  the dredging of silt and  clearing  of

rubbish from the canal can be carried out. A



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



larger  part  of the remaining land  is,  in  fact,

earmarked for future widening of the canal.

<div align="center"><b>CATERPILLARS IN MADRAS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>THORN TREES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Remedial measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development if he will ascertain from

the  Housing  and Development Board  what  remedial

measures will be taken to relieve the residents  of

the  nuisance  caused by caterpillars which  infest

the  Madras  Thorn  trees in  the  Guillemard  Road

Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Madras Thorn trees are liable to be  infested

with caterpillars when new leaves begin to grow. As

soon  as  any tree is discovered to be so infested,

action is taken to destroy the caterpillars with  a

solution of insecticide. Some Madras Thorn trees in

Guillemard Road Estate were recently infested  with

caterpillars    and   they   were   treated    with

insecticide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  can  the Parliamentary Secretary  inform  the

House  how many such trees are there and  how  many

are infested with caterpillars?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there are

99  such  trees  and  only  12  are  infested  with

caterpillars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can the Parliamentary Secretary inform the House whether

these  infested  trees will be cut  down  and  new

ones planted in their place?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  when  the estate is redeveloped, I think  the

problem  of cutting down those trees will  then  be

solved.

<div align="center"><b>VAUGHAN ROAD, LORONG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PATONG AND LORONG ZAITUN</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Metalling)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Law

and   National  Development  if  he  will  consider

metalling the inner portion of Vaughan Road, Lorong

Patong and Lorong Zaitun and, if so, when the  work

will commence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

proposal for metalling of Lorong Zaitun is with the

Urban    and    Rural   Services   Committee    for

consideration. It is suggested that the  other  two

proposals  be  likewise referred  to  the  U.R.S.C.

which will no doubt give them due consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have already submitted my proposals

for the metalling of Vaughan Road and Lorong Patong

to  the  U.R.S.C.  Can the Parliamentary  Secretary

inform  the  House whether or not  these  proposals

will be approved in the near future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if the

Member  for  Thomson  has  already  submitted   his

proposals  to the U.R.S.C., we will bring  them  up

for discussion at the next meeting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ST. MICHAEL'S MARKET</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Accommodation for unlicensed hawkers and staircase to upper storey)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan</b> asked the Minister for

Health (a) if he has plans to enlarge St. Michael's

Market  to  accommodate the unlicensed hawkers  who

are  presently hawking in the concourse outside the

Market;  and  (b) if it is proposed  to  provide  a

staircase  leading directly from the  concourse  to

the  upper  storey of that Market, so as  to  bring

better business to the stall-holders upstairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there are no plans to  enlarge  St.

Michael's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



Market.  All  unlicensed  hawkers  plying  in   the

concourse  in  the  vicinity  of  the  market  were

resited and given a place within the market on 18th

November, 1970. Subsequently, through lack of  firm

enforcement, more unlicensed hawkers have  gathered

there.  There are 42 vacant stalls and  pitches  in

the  market.  It  is  not possible,  therefore,  to

resite within the market all the unlicensed hawkers

outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has, however,

prepared  plans  for  the  construction  of  a  new

hawkers'  centre at Jalan Tenteram.  Those  hawkers

who  cannot be resited in the existing market  will

be moved into this new market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two existing staircases within St.

Michael's Market which already afford access to the

upper  storey.  It is, therefore, not  proposed  to

provide  a staircase leading directly to the  upper

storey of the market.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, may I ask the Minister what will happen to the

unlicensed  hawkers  in the  meantime,  before  the

completion of the proposed hawkers' centre?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, it is proposed to

license  them, which means that they will  have  to

pay  licence  fees. These fees are  at  the  moment

being  paid  by the hawkers or stallholders  inside

the  market,  and therefore the present  unlicensed

hawkers,  when  licensed, will not have  an  unfair

advantage over those inside the market.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, in view of the numerous

complaints that I have received regarding the  high

rentals  of  the market stalls, will  the  Minister

consider  lowering them not only  for  the  present

stallholders  but  also for the unlicensed  hawkers

who will be given licences?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, sir, as far as I

am  concerned.  I have not heard of  complaints  of

high  rentals in the market. But I am hearing  this

for  the first time in this Chamber from the Member

for Whampoa. May I say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



that  the rentals in Government markets are  highly

subsidised. They are very reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as St. Michael's Market is concerned, I

think the major complaint is the unfair competition

which  the  unlicensed hawkers are  giving  to  the

stalls  inside the market. I remember my  visit  to

the  market  - you will be surprised, Sir,  that  I

myself  do  visit markets - during the  last  "Keep

Singapore  Clean"  campaign. The stallholders  came

out  to  see me and their main complaint was,  "We,

the  stallholders  inside the market,  pay  licence

fees  and  it  is  unfair of  you  to  allow  these

unlicensed  hawkers  in the concourse  outside  the

market to get away without paying any fees at  all.

Therefore,  there  is this unfair competition."  In

fact, that was the major complaint they made to me,

but they made no complaint about high rentals.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Minister  consider allowing the market stallholders

to  pay  their rentals on a monthly basis, as  they

did  some  time  ago? They have to  make  quarterly

payments  right now, and this constitutes  quite  a

burden on them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, when we introduced these

quarterly payments for market stallholders  at  the

beginning  of last year, there were complaints  and

grumblings  about  it.  But these  complaints  have

stopped  now.  It  is  quite human  for  people  to

grumble  when there is some change. But may  I  say

that if there are any genuine cases of hardship, we

do consider each case on its merits or demerits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, is the

Minister aware that this market is within a Housing

and  Development Board estate? It is not the policy

of  the Hawkers Department of the Housing Board  to

license unauthorised hawkers outside or within  the

concourse of the market. If it is, this will create

a problem for me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

question  is very relevant, The problem  with  this

market is due to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



division of jurisdiction. In fact, the market comes

under the control of my Ministry, but the concourse

outside  is  under the control of the  Housing  and

Development Board. Anyway, since both of us are  on

the  same  side,  the Ministry of  Health  and  the

Markets  Department  of  the  Housing  Board   will

jointly decide on the policy. But if the Member has

problems, perhaps he can convey them either to  the

Hawkers  Department or the Housing and  Development

Board, as we do have liaison with them, and we will

take joint action.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, when all

the  unauthorised hawkers in the concourse  outside

St. Michael's Market have been licensed and resited

in  the  new  market  at Jalan Tenteram,  will  the

Minister  allow  more unlicensed  hawkers  to  come

along?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, my common

sense tells me no. I think I shall follow my common

sense.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that

is  the Minister's common sense, why does he  allow

the present unlicensed hawkers to trade outside St.

Michael's  Market, as a result of  which  there  is

unfair  competition between them and  the  licensed

hawkers? Is that common sense?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did

explain in my answer that it is because of the lack

of   effective  enforcement  that  the   unlicensed

hawkers have gathered in that area. May I say  that

common  sense  is wanting, but perhaps  the  hawker

inspectors  did have a heart and so  they  did  not

take effective action. That is why this problem has

arisen.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Will the Minister explain

whether  the  Hawkers Department will  continue  to

have  a  heart when dealing with all the unlicensed

hawkers at that particular market?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Common sense again tells me

that they will continue to have a heart!

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Exemption for persons earning $6,000 per annum or less)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if    he   will   consider   introducing   amending

legislation  to exempt a person, who  earns  $6,000

per  annum or less from payment of income  tax,  in

view  of the increase in the cost of living  during

the last few years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the burden of income tax in Singapore is  low

because  of the generous personal reliefs  and  the

graduated  rates of tax. At present  about  120,000

out of 650,000 working persons are liable to income

tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Income Tax Ordinance a taxpayer is

allowed  personal relief of $2,000 plus  an  earned

income relief of 1/5th of his earned income up to a

maximum  of $1,000. A relief of $1,000 is given  in

respect  of his wife, $750 in respect of his  first

child,  $500  each for the second and third  child,

and  $300  each for the fourth and fifth child.  In

addition, the taxpayer is allowed deductions on his

life     insurance    premiums    and    compulsory

contributions   to  the  Central   Provident   Fund

equivalent to that of the income up to a maximum of

$4,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing reliefs and personal deductions

considerably  reduce the burden of  income  tax.  A

married  taxpayer,  earning $6,000  per  annum  for

example, with two children, will have to pay income

tax  of only $9, and a single person earning $6,000

per annum will be liable to pay income tax of $144.

A  married  couple earning $6,000  per  annum,  but

without  children, will have to pay income  tax  of

$84.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, no reason why taxpayers in

this   income  group  should  not  make   a   small

contribution  towards  paying  for  the   security,

educational,   social  and  medical   services   of

Singapore  which are enjoyed by their families  and

by them.

<div align="center"><b>REVISION OF INDUSTRIAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>POLICY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Withdrawal of incentives to foreign investors)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for

Finance if it is feasible now for the Government to

revise  the  industrial policy by  withdrawing  the

investment incentives to future foreign investors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is no. Members may be

aware that only last year the Government introduced

amendments  to  the  Economic Expansion  Incentives

(Relief from Income Tax) Act, 1967, which curtailed

considerably  the incentives offered to  industrial

investors.  The  major  changes  provided  in   the

amendment Bill were as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A reduction in the period of tax relief for

export  enterprises from  15  years  to  eight

years  in  the  case  of exports  as  well  as

pioneer  enterprises, and  from  15  years  to

five   years   in  the  case  of   non-pioneer

enterprises.    However,    in     exceptional

circumstances,  the 15-year  period  is  still

available  for very large enterprises  with  a

capital  investment of (Singapore) $1  billion

or  more,  or those with a capital  investment

of  $150  million of which more than  half  is

owned by permanent residents of the republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The five-year tax relief provided for pioneer

industries  is  now confined  only  to  large

enterprises with fixed capital investments of not

less than $1 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Expansion incentives are restricted only to

those enterprises which incur additional capital

investment  in  fixed assets of more  than  $10

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Depreciation allowances which were allowed to

be  carried forward to the post-pioneer period

at   accelerated  rates  which,   in   effect,

extended the pioneer period beyond five  years

to  six years or seven years are now no longer

allowed  to  be  carried  forward.  Thus  this

restricts  the pioneer period to a maximum  of

five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has emphasised the need for selectivity also in his budget statement. The Government has been very selective in approving incentives. Since November 1970, when the new amendment Bill was brought into effect, only nine pioneer certificates have been

approved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Minister    of   State   consider   lowering    the

qualification of $10 million required for expansion

purposes  to, let us say, $5 million  or  less,  as

this  will  encourage  expansion,  especially   the

smaller local industries? This is the qualification

for pioneer status.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

considering   the   amendments  to   the   Economic

Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income  Tax)  Act

last year, very careful consideration was given  to

incentives, and we decided upon $10 million because

we  thought  this was a good round sum. Of  course,

should  circumstances change, we  would  definitely

consider either lowering it or increasing it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> If the Minister will recall

the   relevant  sitting  when  this  amendment  was

discussed, the then Minister for Finance  indicated

that  any  figure would do, and so  he  picked  $10

million. At that time I thought that he was open to

suggestions for an amendment, but I lost my  chance

at that stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I do not recall the

Minister  saying that. Perhaps in his lighter  mood

he could have made that statement. But I can assure

the  Member for Whampoa that $10 million was  fixed

after due consideration. But, of course, as I  have

just  said, should circumstances change and  if  we

can  with  advantage  lower the sum,  consideration

will definitely be given to it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 72 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that no less than $218,000 has

already  been spent on the underground car park  at

St. Andrew's Cathedral grounds. I shall be grateful

if  the  Minister for Law and National  Development

can  enlighten this House on what progress has been

made  on  this project. I refer to page  7  of  the

Memorandum on the Development Estimates in which it

is stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Work on the car park costing about $1.90

million  is  expected  to  start  in  the  1971/72

financial year.'



<br><br>Sir,  a  sum of more than $200,000 has been  spent.

Can  the Minister enlighten this House on how,  why

and  where this sum has been spent? Also, when will

the  underground car park be completed and how many

cars will it be able to hold?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, originally a

small  car  park  was planned to be  built  in  the

grounds  of  St. Andrew's Cathedral.  The  proposal

was, however, temporarily shelved in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



favour of a bigger scheme. The study of the need of

a  bigger  parking scheme is, in fact, in  progress

and  construction work will begin as  soon  as  the

scheme  has been finalised and approved. We  are  a

little concerned that the digging and piling in the

compound  of the cathedral might in any way  affect

the building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the original scheme was not proceeded with, a

sum  of $218,000, being the difference between  the

provision of half a million dollars and the revoted

sum,  was in fact not spent on the underground  car

park, but was used for establishing other car parks

in  Singapore. In fact, only $3,500 has been  spent

on preliminary work relating to the underground car

park scheme at St. Andrew's Cathedral grounds, such

as  the construction of a model of the proposed car

park,  test bores and the printing of plans. Beyond

that,  I  am afraid nothing much has been done  nor

has much money been spent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, when will the car park be

completed? Another question is, how many cars  will

this car park hold?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I cannot say with any assurance when

the car park will be completed because the plan has

not  been  completed. It will take at least  a  few

years.  Neither can I say exactly how many  parking

bays   will  be  provided.  This  depends  on   the

completed plans. I have spoken earlier of a  small-scale  car  park and then a second plan was  for  a

bigger-scale  car  park. But at  the  most  we  can

provide  space  for about 500 to 600  cars  without

affecting the Cathedral building itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

his   reply,  and  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   my

amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to

know  from the Minister where these parking  places

will be established.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, up to date, the Car Parks

Division has over 200 parking places with  a  total

of  13,494 car parking lots. More than one-third of

these  lots  are  located in the  central  business

district,  whilst  the  remaining  two-thirds   are

mostly in the city area with some extending  to  as

far  as  Singapore Airport in the north and  Jurong

Fishing  Port  in the south-west.  There  are  also

parking  places at very low parking fees for  about

2,000 cars on the fringe of the city at the Kallang

Park  sports complex, Beach Road and Havelock Road.

The  division also provides parking for lorries  at

30  parking  places with 529 lots, and  motorcycles

and  scooters at 42 parking places with 3,830 lots.

It also manages 111 taxi stands with 756 bays.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am grateful to the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 72 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 204.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister please explain why the

construction  of  a garbage composting  plant  is

being  contemplated? I note that  this  project  is

still   subject   to   the   Development   Planning

Committee's sanction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the garbage composting plant

is used to ferment garbage and produce compost from

the garbage. Compost is an organic soil conditioner

like  sludge, manure and prawn dust. But  it  is  a

better  grade  of soil conditioner than  sludge  or

manure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962, it was proposed to establish a garbage

composting  plant  by private enterprise  with  the

participation of the Economic Development Board. It

was then considered to be an economic proposition,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



as  it  was  thought  that  the  compost

produced  could  be  sold at profitable  prices  to

neighbouring  countries,  in  particular  Malaysia.

However, this proposal was not implemented  because

of  the  separation  in 1965, following  which  the

Malaysian market for compost was no longer open  to

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, times have changed again and, with the

accelerated programme of planting trees, shrubs and

other  greenery in Singapore, the local demand  for

soil  conditioners has increased substantially.  It

was    therefore   decided   to   reconsider    the

establishment of this plant in view of the  changed

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a comparative cost study has been undertaken

by a committee of Government officials representing

the   various   departments  and  Ministries.   The

committee  has  advised that  it  is  comparatively

cheaper  to  establish a garbage compost  plant  to

dispose  of  garbage and refuse  than  to  use  the

present  conventional method of dumping garbage  in

the swamp at Tampines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual cost of operating the plant is

estimated   to  be  about  $650,000,  which   would

represent an annual saving of about $110,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I had already asked several

questions in the House last night before Parliament

rose and the Minister must have missed my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



questions   when   he  answered  another   Member's

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of money has been spent by Government

on the reclamation of land. I wish to know how much

has  been spent on reclamation schemes to date, and

what  is  the acreage of the reclaimed land.  I  am

asking  these questions because I have had occasion

to  travel  along  Bedok  Road  where  I  saw  vast

stretches  of  reclaimed land. However,  I  noticed

that  there  are only several blocks  of  buildings

there.  In  this connection, I wonder  whether  the

Ministry  of  Law  and  National  Development,   in

particular  the National Development Division,  has

any plans to develop the reclaimed land and, if so,

what  they  are.  Also will some of  the  sites  be

offered  to  the private sector, like  the  "Golden

Mile", for private development? I shall be grateful

if  the  Minister can enlighten this  House  on  my

queries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the areas reclaimed

by the Government on the east coast are, of course,

mainly  meant  for  purposes  which  would  be   of

economic  advantage to the state. The  reclamation,

as   the   Member  for  Punggol  knows,  is   being

undertaken  in four phases, and the reclaimed  land

will be utilised for the development, firstly, of a

major highway to link the heavily congested eastern

part  of  the republic with the city centre.  Apart

from this, the reclaimed land will also be utilised

for development of open spaces and parks to provide

the   much-needed  recreational  amenities  in  our

republic,  tourist projects such as  the  Aquarama,

bathing  beaches, hotels, institutional  buildings,

including  schools,  junior colleges,  recuperation

centres  and  even  homes for the aged,  commercial

centres and residential homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two phases of the scheme which have

been  completed have yielded about 1,135  acres  of

reclaimed  land. The proposal is to plan  for  some

development on the sites around the middle of  next

year  subject  to development of the infrastructure

for roads,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



sewerage,  water  and  electricity.  Although   the

preliminary  plans  for the development  have  been

completed, the Government is now looking  into  the

possibility of engaging a well-known consultant  to

review the plans for this major development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol can rest assured that it

is  our intention to offer some of the sites to the

private  sector on similar lines to  those  offered

under  the three sales of urban renewal sites.  The

reserve  price will have to take into  account  the

cost of reclamation, including the provision of the

infrastructure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that the development of the military

camp  at Bedok was made during 1967 when expediency

dictated the urgent need to provide a camp for  use

by  our  military personnel. As timing was crucial,

it  was  the  only place that offered the  required

land  area  for immediate development.  The  action

taken  was  governed  by the  situation  prevailing

during  that  period, and the Ministry of  National

Development  could  not take  on  the  Ministry  of

Defence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

answered   my   query  on  the  cost  involved   in

reclaiming the thousands of acres of land.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It is roughly $1 to $1.50 per square

foot.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, assuming that the cost of

reclaiming  land is between $1 and  $2  per  square

foot and taking into account the provision for  the

infrastructure,  will  the  Ministry  consider  not

making  exorbitant profits, as has been alleged  in

this House, when the sites are offered for sale  to

the private sector?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the cost price may be $1 or $2.

But  we  cannot just give it for $1 or $2,  because

the  land  must  be sold on tender. In  any  public

sale,  there  must  be  tenders,  and  the  highest

tenderer will normally get the land. If the  Member

for  Punggol tenders for $1 and the Member for Bras

Basah  offers  $10, obviously the latter  gets  the

land.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I must thank the Minister

for his patience and his reply. I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 72 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item 001 of subhead

404.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I would like to seek

clarification from the Minister whether the amount

provided for is for the construction of a police

station in Toa Payoh. If it is so, when will

construction commence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the provision of a little more

than  $1½  million under this particular  item  is,

firstly, for the renovation and alteration  to  the

Hill Street Police Station at an estimated cost  of

$578,000.  Secondly,  the  construction  of  a  new

Police  Divisional Headquarters at Toa Payoh  at  a

cost  of about $970,250, and the construction of  a

new  Quartermaster's Store at  Hemmant  Road  at  a

total  cost  of $957,000. Whilst the renovation  of

the  Hill Street Police Station is expected  to  be

completed  within the next fiscal year,  the  other

two  projects, which involve new construction,  may

have  to be completed over a longer period.  Hence,

for  the  next  financial year, only  $428,000  and

$537,000  have  been provided for  the  new  Police

Divisional  Headquarters at Toa Payoh and  the  new

Quartermaster's Store.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 72 be

reduced by $100*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sim Boon Woo.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Head 72, I would like to talk about

the problems of urban



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



renewal.  In the urban renewal programme,  we  have

achieved  a lot. The Government has attracted  many

local  as  well as foreign investors to participate

in  our  urban  renewal  projects  because  it  has

offered incentives to the developers. However,  the

rapid  development  of urban renewal  has  affected

many people. Those who have been badly affected are

small  businessmen and they do not have the capital

to   participate  in  this  big-scale   development.

Therefore,   I   wish  to  ask  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for Law  and  National

Development  whether  the  Government   will   take

measures  to  help those who are  affected  by  the

urban renewal projects. For example, can he tell us

whether  he  will allot a piece of  land  to  these

small merchants to do their business, and let  them

participate in these development projects  so  that

they  will  be  given the opportunity  to  continue

their  business  as  usual? In this  way,  our  own

citizens    can   participate   in   our   national

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also because of the rapid development of our

urban  renewal,  more and more people  have  to  be

evacuated. But the Housing and Development Board is

not  able to cater for the needs of those  who  are

affected because it cannot build enough shophouses.

Therefore, the demand always exceeds the supply. As

far as I know, some of those who were evacuated and

whose shophouses were demolished two or three years

ago,  sometimes even longer, have not been allotted

suitable  shophouses  up  to  now.  How  can   they

continue  with their business to earn a living.  It

is  impossible for them to continue living! This is

indeed a very serious problem. In our new Five-Year

Plan,  I  hope  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  will

consider carefully the question of providing enough

shophouses to those affected by urban renewal; for

example, grocery and coffee shops, restaurants  and

so   on.  If  we  can  increase  the  building   of

shophouses in our new Five-year Plan, it will  help

those  who have been affected by the urban  renewal

programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Government  has considered the proposition  to

offer  sites to those shopkeepers affected by urban

renewal  who  could  join forces  and  collectively

develop  the sites. In fact, Government has already

offered and concluded one such transaction  with  a

group of shopkeepers affected in Precinct South III

in  the area bounded by Upper Hokien Street,  South

Bridge  Road,  Upper Cross Street  and  New  Bridge

Road. The shopkeepers have formed themselves into a

company  jointly to redevelop the site  offered  by

the  Government. Plans have already been  submitted

by   this  group  for  the  site  offered  by   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this particular case, which is

intended   as   a  pilot  project  to   study   the

possibility   of   such  a  mode   of   relocation,

Government  is  also  working  out  another   pilot

relocation programme under similar arrangements for

another   group   of   shopkeepers   affected    by

resettlement  around  the area  known  as  Precinct

North  III bounded by Victoria Street, Arab Street,

North Bridge Road and Rochore Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that shopkeepers affected by

urban   renewal  are  allocated  alternative   shop

premises  within the Housing and Development  Board

estates.  Some  of  these are  located  within  the

central  area  and others are outside  the  central

area.  Unfortunately, due to difficulties of choice

and  timing,  not all cases affected  are  provided

with  alternative premises in the preferred  areas.

In  the  case of coffee shops, because of  planning

and  design restrictions, the supply of such  shops

is  limited.  However,  coffee  shops  affected  by

priority clearance are allocated shop premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lessons learnt in the pilot urban

renewal   project,  the  shortcomings  experienced,

especially  relating to clearance, will  be  looked

into  and better solutions found. In future, it  is

hoped to build more of the required shops to assist

in relocation and to minimise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



hardship  created by urban renewal, which  everyone

has  accepted  as being essential  for  the  proper

were  evacuated.  He says that the  Government  has

planned  to  let  those who were affected  work  in

collaboration    with   one    another    in    the

redevelopment, but has the Government laid down any

minimum  amount  of  money  as  capital  for   this

redevelopment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $39,822,800 for Head 72 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 73 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 104*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I wish to draw the

attention of the House to the fact that, apart from

the  provision asked for in respect of the  Central

Abattoir in Jurong, there is, however, no provision

for  rural  abattoirs. Sir, if I  may  refresh  the

memory  of  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for  Law  and  National  Development   by

referring  him to Hansard, Vol. 29, No.  16,  dated

26th  March, 1970, col. 1211, in which his Minister

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Government's thinking on the need for rural

abattoirs has not changed.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further down in the reply, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That does not mean to say that we have abandoned

the idea of building abattoirs in the rural areas.'



<br><br>Sir,  it is precisely for this reason that  I  wish

the Parliamentary Secretary to inform the House  of

the  reasons  for the deletion of the provision  in

the  Development Estimates for the ensuing year for

the setting up of rural abattoirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of my colleagues have vigorously argued

for  the  setting up of rural abattoirs. I  believe

the Member for Jalan Kayu did make some remarks  in

this  respect, and so did some other Members.  Sir,

we  shall  be grateful if the Minister can  explain

why  the idea of setting up abattoirs in the  rural

areas has been shelved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Central Abattoir in Jurong, I

remember  the  Minister on that same occasion  said

that his Ministry was looking into the question  of

handing over the running of the Central Abattoir to

a  private organisation. In this connection, may  I

refer again to the Hansard of the same date and  to

the  same column in which the Minister said, and  I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But Government's thinking on who should run these

abattoirs has changed. In view of our experience at

the  Jurong  Abattoir, we are thinking  of  letting

private  enterprise run even the Jurong Abattoir-in

other   words,  a  statutory  board  or  a   public

company-and we are inviting the private  sector  to

come in. We do not want just the civil servants  to

run  the abattoir if it is converted into a  public

company.'



<br><br>Sir,  I believe some progress has been made, and  I

would like to know the actual progress made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  know that  the  Government  has

already spent $5 million on the Central Abattoir at

Jurong.  From what I know, this abattoir  has  been

designed by experts, and it is comparable  to  that

of  other countries. But we must remember that  the

practice  in other countries may not be  applicable

to  Singapore. For example, foreigners do  not  eat

the  skin  of  the  pig or its  entrails,  but  the

majority of the people of Singapore do eat them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since its inception three years ago a number

of  incidents have occurred at the Jurong Abattoir.

In   order  to  avoid  trouble  and  to  ease   the

difficulties,  it  is  learnt  that   the   Primary

Production  Department has handed over the  Central

Abattoir to a private enterprise. If this is so,  I

cannot understand why it is necessary to provide  a

sum  of  $247,170 in the Development Estimates  for

1971-72. I would also ask whether the employees  of

the  abattoir  will  remain as  the  staff  of  the

Primary  Production  Department  and  whether   the

private company will keep a separate account  which

is independent of the department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the newspapers, the slaughtering of

pigs  will  be carried out in the abattoir  in  the

daytime.  Many people object to this  because  they

say  that  if  the  pigs  are  slaughtered  in  the

daytime,  the  meat  will  not  be  fresh.  Can  the

Minister  say if there is such a plan to  slaughter

the pigs in the daytime?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Jurong

Abattoir   Co.   (Private)  Ltd, was   officially

incorporated  on  11th  January,  1971,   with   an

authorised  capital of $5 million.  A  manager  was

appointed  to  take  over  control  of  the  Jurong

Abattoir  from 8th February this year. The existing

staff  have  either been offered company  terms  or

secondment  terms. The staff dealing  with  quality

control have, however, been retained in the Primary

Production Department, as quality control functions

are best retained by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the establishment of rural abattoirs,

their   economic   and  other  aspects,   including

suitable  alternative schemes, are presently  under

active  consideration  by  the  management  of  the

company.  A decision on this matter will  be  taken

after the feasibility study is completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that quality and hygiene are

maintained  at internationally accepted  standards,

inspection of the animals slaughtered continues  to

be  carried  out  by  qualified  veterinarians  and

specially trained animal health inspectors  of  the

Primary Production



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



Department. That is why the vote under this

subhead is still retained.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Parliamentary Secretary does not seem to  have

answered   two  questions.  I  asked  whether   the

accounts   of  the  Jurong  Abattoir  are   on   an

independent basis or whether they are maintained by

the Primary Production Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is whether or not it is true

that the slaughtering of pigs will be carried out

in the day-time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  regard  to the Central Abattoir,  I  have

mentioned that it is under the control of a private

company. Needless to say, the Central Abattoir is a

private  limited company. But in respect of quality

control, that function still rests with the Primary

Production Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the slaughtering of pigs in the day-time, the main reason for this is to reduce the

expenditure   of  the  Central  Abattoir   and   to

economise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to

hear  that there is a feasibility study on  whether

or not abattoirs in the rural areas could be set up

by  this private organisation. But I am afraid that

the  Parliamentary Secretary has forgotten that  in

1968  there was a provision of a token vote of  $10

for  three  rural abattoirs to be set up.  In  1969

there  was  no vote, but the matter was brought  up

again in 1970. I sincerely hope that there will  be

no further "feasibility study" into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years have gone by and I have brought up

the question of abattoirs in the rural areas purely

from  another angle, namely, these rural  abattoirs

will relieve the pork retailers of having to travel

all  the  way  up to Jurong, since the abattoir  at

French  Road  has closed down. Not  only  will  the

retailers  in  Punggol be inconvenienced  but  also

those from as far as Jalan Kayu, Tampines, and, for

that matter, Changi.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the Primary Production

Department,  which  is in control  of  the  private

organisation   as   stated  by  the   Parliamentary

Secretary, will seriously look into this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise to speak in support of what the Member

for Punggol has said. The pork sellers in the rural

areas  are  faced with a big problem. Because  they

have  to  travel a long distance to buy  the  meat,

they  have  to  get up in the early  hours  of  the

morning  in order to go all the way to Jurong.  The

Central Abattoir is very busy, and the pork sellers

have  to  wait a long time before they  can  get  a

share of the meat. If we can establish a number  of

small rural abattoirs, it will not be necessary for

these  pork sellers to travel such a long distance.

I  hope  the Minister will seriously consider  this

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has also said that after

three years we find that this scheme does not work,

and  even the department itself knows that it  does

not work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is not that of slaughtering of

pigs but the slaughtering of cows. I know that some

hawkers  who  sell beef noodles  are  not  able  to

obtain  a  fresh supply of the entrails. Apparently

it  takes ten hours for the frozen entrails of  the

cow  to be transported from Jurong to the city, and

by that time these entrails are not fresh any more.

Therefore,  they cannot be sold to  the  public.  I

hope  the  Minister  will carry out  the  necessary

investigation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like

to  raise  another question regarding  the  Central

Abattoir.  Is  it  supposed to be  a  profit-making

enterprise,   or  is  it  to  be  an   organisation

performing a service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has also said that the reason for slaughtering pigs in the day-time is to reduce expenditure and to economise. Since this has been objected to by the Slaughters' Association, I hope the Minister will give consideration to their representation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Member for Jurong has asked whether  the

Central Abattoir is a profit-earning enterprise  or

whether it is an organisation to provide a service.

I  can  assure  him  that  it  is  a  profit-making

organisation, and not a non-profit organisation.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has suggested

establishing  small rural abattoirs. I  can  convey

his  suggestion to the private company which is  in

control  of the Central Abattoir now. I am  not  so

sure that it takes 10 hours for the frozen entrails

to  be  sent from Jurong to the city. If the Member

can provide further information, I will give him  a

detailed answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I  hope  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  will

investigate first whether such a situation  exists.

Can he do this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in replying to

the   Member   for  Sembawang,  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  said that he would bring up to  the  new

private  company the suggestion of having abattoirs

in  the  rural  areas. What I said was  that  three

years  have already passed. What is being  done  in

this  connection? This is my question. I know  that

whenever suggestions are put forward, the reply is,

"We will consider them and bring them up." But what

is  the  net  result? If there is no  result,  then

something else must be done.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> It is under investigation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> It is not under investigation.

If the Minister for Social Affairs says it is still

under investigation, I wonder when he will complete

his  investigation. Sir, this is the  crux  of  the

problem. Even the statement that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



the  matter  is under "active consideration"  means

nothing to me. What I want is positive construction

of the rural abattoirs.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact that the

Member for Punggol raised this question three years

ago and I promised him consideration means that  we

did  give it consideration. But I am not an  expert

on  abattoirs  and  my experts  did  not  think  it

advisable to set them up at once. Meanwhile, things

went on at the Central Abattoir in Jurong. Now that

a  company  has been formed, it would be unfair  to

this  company if we immediately open up three  more

rural abattoirs. The interests of the company  must

now be considered. The Member's suggestion has been

considered but not accepted. It does not mean  that

when a suggestion is made here, we must consider it

and  we must accept it. The experts' views may  not

tally with the Member's views. But it does not mean

that   we   have  been  sleeping  on  the  Member's

suggestion. I can assure him of that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now when

I  read  out the relevant portion of the Minister's

reply last year, he was not here to listen to it. I

do  not  wish to reiterate, but since he has agreed

with  me that we should give this new company  time

to  settle down and that he will try to accommodate

my  suggestion. I am happy with that, and therefore

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 202.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I make some remarks on this subhead,

may  I,  with  your permission, range over  subhead

203*, which also stands in my name?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The  same amendment also stood in the  name  of Mr Ho Kah Leong, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 203.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I just have a simple and

straightforward question to ask. With regard to the

number  of  intensive  farming improvement  schemes

that  have  been carried out, where have they  been

carried  out,  what  positive  results  have   been

achieved, and also, in similar respects, what about

the  factory  farming pilot scheme? I  have  always

been in sympathy with the farmers, having come from

a  rural  area in which there is plenty of  farming

around. The Primary Production Department has  come

up  with  a  very  substantial  figure  of  farming

produce in its annual report. I wonder whether  the

Minister for Law and National Development is  aware

of  the  inhibitions on the part of  landowners  in

connection   with   lands  which   are   zoned   as

agricultural areas. In other words, lands which are

zoned   as   agricultural  areas  mean  that   only

agricultural development can take place. Here again

the  Minister  may come up with the statement,  "We

may  have just a few landowners who may prevent the

tenant farmers from further utilising their land or

extending  the area of farming." Sir, I would  urge

the Minister to look into this matter, because land

availability  is scarce and, with  other  forms  of

development  going on, more and more land  will  be

taken  up. Therefore, there is need to continue  to

preserve   certain  zoned  areas  for  agricultural

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand we import quite a lot of vegetables

but  not eggs or poultry. We have now a surplus  of

eggs  and poultry. In fact, we even export  broiler

chicks  and  eggs overseas. But unfortunately  now,

Sir - you may or may not be aware of it - the price

of eggs has taken a dip. Some Members may not agree

that  eggs are not that cheap. I say that the price

of eggs has come down to about 6 1/2 to 6 3/4 cents each,

and  I  wonder whether or not Government will  look

into  the  matter. In discussions some  years  back

with   the  Director  of  Primary  Production,   he

indicated   that   Government   was   contemplating

building  an egg factory in which the surplus  eggs

would be bought over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



by  this  factory and turned into egg powder.  Sir,

what   feasibility  studies  have  been   made   to

establish such an egg factory?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have  an amendment under subhead 203. Since  the

Member  for  Punggol has ranged over this  subhead,

may I also speak on it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  in  full sympathy with what the  Member  for

Punggol  has expressed. Land is a scarce factor  of

production in our country. Many farmers  have  been

affected by resettlement and the new area  of  land

allotted to them is very small. Therefore, we  must

try our best to introduce intensive farming methods

or  the factory farming pilot scheme to remedy  the

deficiency of land and the small size of the farms.

I  believe  that  the  intensive  farm  improvement

schemes  or the factory farming pilot scheme  which

have  been  under active experiment by the  Primary

Production  Department  have  achieved  a   certain

measure  of  success. Can the Minister  inform  the

House what progress and achievements have been made

by  these two schemes? Also, can these two  schemes

be  applied  to  the  whole  farming  community  in

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the intensive farm

improvement scheme was initiated in 1968  with  the

objective of introducing modern scientific  methods

of  farming  to  the  farmers so  that  they  could

intensify  their  activities  and  increase   their

productivity.  Under  the  scheme,   research   was

initiated to improve the use of horticultural crops

through  the  selection of  a  good  parent  plant,

through  better manurial practices and the  control

of pests and diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies are being carried out at the

Sembawang Field Experimental Station as well  as  a

demonstration  farm at Lim Chu  Kang.  The  results

obtained from all these studies have been and  will

continue to be passed on to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



farmers  through  the Primary Production  Extension

Service  or  through training courses organised  by

the department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for land for agriculture, the Primary

Production Department is working closely  with  the

planning authority on the future needs of land  for

agriculture. The Planning Department is at  present

completing  a  study into the overall  planning  of

land  use for Singapore, including the planning  of

land  used  for agricultural purposes. However,  it

must  be  realised  that,  with  the  limited  land

available  in  Singapore and with the great  demand

for  land  for other purposes, the use of land  for

agricultural purposes, though not neglected, has to

be considered in the context of Singapore's overall

economic development. The Government recognises the

need  to  optimise  the use of  agricultural  land,

including   private  land  used  for   agriculture.

However,  it  has  at present no  power  to  compel

owners of private land to optimise the use of their

land  for  agricultural purposes. If the owners  of

private land in areas zoned for agriculture wish to

make fuller use of their land, they can always seek

the advice of the Primary Production Department  on

the  type  of  agriculture which  can  be  suitably

undertaken on their land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the factory farming scheme which

has  been raised by both Members, the proposal  has

only   been   approved   in   principle   and   its

implementation is expected to be initiated  towards

the  end  of this year. Whether it is practical  to

introduce  multi-storey flatted farms  on  a  large

scale to farmers in Singapore will depend very much

on  the  results yielded by a pilot  scheme  to  be

introduced. Whether or not the farmers  will  adopt

factory farming methods and how extensively factory

farming can be carried out in Singapore will depend

on the results yielded by this pilot project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have raised

the  question  of  the surplus of eggs,  their  low

price,  and  what good use we will make  from  this

surplus of eggs; for example, the building of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



an  egg-powder  factory in Singapore.  I  shall  be

grateful  if the Minister can enlighten this  House

on this matter.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am sorry I did not answer that

question, Sir. We tried to interest several parties

to  start this egg-powder factory, but no  one  was

interested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the price of eggs, I think I have on

several occasions commented in this House that when

the  price goes down, I have to explain what  I  am

doing  about it. When the price goes up, I have  to

explain what I am doing to stamp it down. But  this

is  the  result of supply and demand and there  are

fluctuations. Sometimes within one year, the  price

goes up and comes down. It does not remain stable.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

more important question here is whether the farmers

are  able to make a profit at the present level  of

the price of eggs. In other words, has productivity

increased  commensurately  with  the  decrease   in

price?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not

the  question. The price of eggs as  it  stands  is

insufficient  for the farmers to  make  a  marginal

profit.  I  come from a rural area and I know  what

the  position  is. The point is  that  there  is  a

surplus of eggs on the market resulting in a dip in

the price. The Minister has just now mentioned that

it  is  a question of supply and demand. But  I  am

afraid the supply exceeds the demand. There  was  a

plan  to  set  up a factory to turn eggs  into  egg

powder   for   sale  overseas.  The  Minister   has

mentioned  that  his  Ministry  tried  to  interest

several  parties to start this factory but  no  one

was interested. This takes my mind back to the time

when  one of our Ministers - I cannot remember  who

said  that  Government would take  the  plunge.  If

investors  dare not go into a venture because  they

think  there is no likelihood of making money,  why

should  the Government not take a closer look  into

the question of setting up an egg-powder factory?

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Whampoa

made  a  reasonable  point. It  is  a  question  of

whether the farmers are suffering.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, they are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> This is the feeling of the Member for

Punggol. That is his information. But that  is  not

my information. The price of eggs has not gone down

that low. If the price of eggs is one or two cents,

then  I  say something would have to be done  about

it.  I think I must repeat myself here again.  When

the price goes up, Members ask me to bring it down.

When  the price goes down, other Members ask me  to

bring it up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the egg factory, no one is interested and

neither is Government, anyway not at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am indeed grateful to the

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 206.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember that last year the subhead was

"Farm    Licensing,   Agricultural    Survey    and

Agricultural Statistics Unit." Why is it that  only

the  Agricultural Statistics Unit is left for 1971-72?  Does it mean that the farm licensing  and  the

agricultural survey have already been completed?  I

remember  that  farm licensing is undertaken  every

year.  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister   the

following questions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can he inform this House how many farms have

been  registered  since the farm licensing  scheme

came into operation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As regards farmers who have been licensed,

will they be given priority in

the allotment of land when they are evicted from their

present farms?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Minister in answer to my question last

year  said  that  the  data  collected  under  farm

licensing  would be used to ascertain the  existing

state  of  agriculture  in Singapore.  This  is  in

Hansard,  Vol. 29, No. 16, dated 26th March,  1970,

col.   1214.  Now  that  all  the  data  have  been

collected,  can the Minister inform this  House  of

the   condition  of  the  agricultural  sector  and

whether   there   are   any   plans   for   further

development?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Is the Ministry of National Development -

considering  any  measures to provide  the  farmers

with market research services of not only the local

market  but  also  of  foreign markets?  This  will

provide   the  farmers  with  useful  guidance   in

concentrating on agricultural produce for export.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, farm licensing is at present conducted by  the

Agricultural Statistics Unit and that is the reason

why there is no vote for farm licensing in 1971-72.

Up to date, the number of farmers licensed is about

26,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also wants to know whether

licensed farmers will be allotted land if they  are

evicted  from  their  farms. This  will  depend  on

whether  the farmer concerned is a full-time  or  a

part-time  farmer. In other words,  it  depends  on

whether all the members of the household depend  on

farming  for  their  livelihood.  If  some  of  the

members of the household work as taxi drivers or in

the  factories. I believe the Government  will  not

allot land to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Members' third question whether Government

has  any plans for agricultural development, I  can

tell  the  House  that at the moment  the  planning

section of the Ministry of National Development  is

studying  this question and is trying to  delineate

certain areas for agricultural development. So  the

whole scheme is now under consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to know whether the Primary

Production  Department has  any  plans  to  provide

farmers  with  market research  services.  We  have

already carried out farm registration work  and  we

have  sufficient data to know the quantity  of  our

agricultural  produce and their varieties.  On  the

question of marketing this agricultural produce, we

maintain close liaison with the Ministry of Finance

in  order to ensure that this agricultural  produce

can be exported abroad.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Parliamentary Secretary in his answer says that

farm  registration is being conducted and  he  also

knows  the number of registered farms. But he  does

not  know  how  many  farms  are  in  existence  in

Singapore.  He  says that there  are  about  26,000

registered farms. What I want to know is  how  many

farms  there  are  in Singapore  and  the  definite

number of those registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has also said that if some members of a farming household are taxi drivers or work in the factories, then the farmer will not be given land in case of eviction. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how the farmer got a farm licence in the first instance. If

he has a farm licence, that means he is a farmer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  I  would  also like to ask the  Parliamentary

Secretary  this question. Last year  when  we  were

debating  the  same topic, the Minister  said  that

they  were  investigating  the  conditions  of  our

farming  community.  I  do not  know  whether  this

investigation or survey has been completed. Because

of  this  lapse  of  time, it has  led  to  certain

members  of  farming households having to  work  as

taxi drivers, etc.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on the

question  of  the  agricultural  survey,   in   our

estimates  for 1970-71 we certainly had a  vote  on

this  item.  I  do  not know why  the  Ministry  of

Finance has not allotted another sum for the coming

financial year. Therefore, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



Member  should  ask the Minister for Finance  about

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agricultural survey was conducted for the

purpose of providing us with more data to enable us

to  render better services and facilities  for  our

farmers.  If  the  Member  for  Jurong  wants  more

details  and  the exact number of farms registered,

etc.,  I  can ask the Primary Production Department

to  send  him  a report. I can also let  the  other

Members from the rural areas have a similar report.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on the

question  of the agricultural survey, I  am  afraid

that  all  the Government departments are  shifting

the blame to one another. If the Primary Production

Department and the Agricultural Survey Unit are  so

important  to the Ministry of National Development,

why  is it that the sum allotted cannot be used for

this  work?  Does  it  not  go  to  show  that  the

Government  is  putting emphasis  on  industry  and

neglecting agriculture?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on the

question of the agricultural survey, we will  raise

the  matter again with the Ministry of Finance.  If

the  Member for Jurong will support us, we will  be

very happy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel that

not  only I myself will support it, but all Members

of   Parliament   in   the  rural   constituencies,

including the M.P.s for Tampines and Choa Chu Kang,

will also be glad to give their support. Almost all

M.P.s  agree to the allocation of this sum for  the

agricultural  survey. I hope that the Parliamentary

Secretary  will  raise this matter again  with  the

Ministry of Finance so that an agricultural  survey

can  be carried out earlier. If he can give us  the

assurance,   then  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   my

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, I can give the Member

for Jurong that assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 301.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House a few days ago, we were talking

about matters relating to deep-sea fishing. We know

that   there   is   a  certain  dislocation   among

Government departments. For instance, the  Ministry

of   Finance  has  divested  the  deep-sea  fishing

industry  of its pioneer status. Even the  Minister

for Law and National Development does not know why!

If  deep-sea fishing does not get the full  support

of  the  Government, and if it does  not  have  any

major  capital  investment,  for  example,  fishing

boats  and  other facilities, can the graduates  of

the   Fishing  Training  Centre  have  any   career

outlet'?  If  they cannot get jobs,  I  believe  no

youths  will  be interested in joining the  Fishing

Training  Centre.  I  would like  to  know  if  the

facilities  for  the  Training Centre  are  wasted.

Since  the  setting up of the Training Centre,  how

many  graduates have been employed?  Are  the  jobs

related  to  the  course in which  they  have  been

trained?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as for deep-sea

fishing and pioneer status, my views coincide  with

those  of  the Member for Jurong. I am not shifting

the  buck  here, but the predecessor [Dr Goh  Keng

Swee]  of  the  present Minister  for  Finance  was

responsible  for the removal of pioneer  status  in

respect  of  deep-sea  fishing.  Since  the  Member

raised this question of pioneer status in the House

earlier  in the week, I have spoken to the Minister

for  Finance and the Member will be happy  to  know

that  the Minister has informed me that the  matter

is  not closed. I will be taking up the cudgels  on

behalf of deep-sea fishing again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> As for the Fishing Training Centre at

Changi,  which was established with the  assistance

of  the  United  Nations Development Programme,  it

runs  two  courses the deck course and  the  engine

course. The deck course is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



aimed   at   producing   navigators   and   fishing

technicians,  and  the engine course  is  to  train

fishing vessel engineers. Out of the first batch of

24  trainees taken in August last year, 11 were for

the  deck course and 13 for the engine course.  The

success or failure of the centre can best be judged

from  the performance of the trainees, but  as  the

first batch has not yet passed out, it is too early

to comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During late 1969 and early 1970, prior to the

running of these one-year courses, there were  four

short  intensive two to three months'  courses  for

fishermen.  Out  of  a total of  75  fishermen  who

attended  these courses, 51 of them  completed  and

passed the courses. Most of those who completed the

courses  were  offered jobs by  commercial  fishing

companies  on  the recommendation  of  the  Primary

Production  Department, but unfortunately  some  of

them did not remain long in their new job. For  any

who have been trained and say that they cannot find

a  job,  the Primary Production Department will  be

pleased to secure places for them on off-shore  and

deep-sea  fishing  vessels operating  from  Jurong.

Most  of  these  vessels are short  of  local  crew

members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, if I may add

another  point. At Kankar, in Punggol, there  is  a

small  fishing port. There is an acute shortage  of

seamen.  I  welcome  any Member who  can  recommend

seamen to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in view of the explanation given by the Minister, I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ho Kah Leong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I wish to bring up two

points.  The  first  point  refers  to  the  Jurong

Fishing Port and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



Fish  Market and the second to the fish  market  at

Kankar, which is in the Punggol constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> We know that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you very much, Sir. I

would  like to know from the Minister for  Law  and

National  Development  how  much  fish  by  way  of

tonnage and value the Jurong Fishing Port and  Fish

Market  handles  each year. As  far  as  Kankar  is

concerned, I believe I have given the figure of  no

less  than $7.2 million worth of fish being handled

at  the little market in Ponggol. Therefore  it  is

not  "fishy business", as earlier indicated. I mean

it  is  really fishing business pertaining to  fish

and  not "fishy business" in the sense that you may

think of. Anyway, I attach much importance to deep-sea  fishing and offshore fishing. Invariably,  the

facilities  at  the Jurong Fishing  Port  and  Fish

Market  are inadequate and I welcome the  provision

of  $200,000  in this respect. If the Minister  can

enlighten this House on how this provision will  be

utilised, I shall be most grateful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the fish market and fishing port

at  Kankar, I am glad to say that the wisdom of the

Government has prevailed, because, between 1964 and

1966,  the  Ministry  of National  Development  was

quite  adamant in removing the little fishing fleet

from   Kankar  to  Jurong.  However,  common  sense

prevailed  and  today  I can safely  say  that  the

fishing port at Kankar has developed very fast,  in

fact too fast. From a fleet of less than 60 fishing

vessels,  ranging from five tons to 15 tons,  using

this  port  during those years,  it  has  now  been

increased  to  slightly more than a hundred.  I  am

told  that several more are being built.  They  are

much bigger in size, in length and in tonnage.  The

fishing  port  at Kankar is fast becoming  quite  a

busy  place  and  the  facilities  there  will   be

inadequate in the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether  his Ministry has  any  plans  to

develop  the Kankar fish market. I would also  like

to  know  what is happening to the latest  petition

asking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



for  a  jetty that was sent to the Director of  the

Primary Production Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we know that the Jurong Central Fish Market was set

up  two  years  ago  with the co-operation  of  the

merchants  concerned.  At that  time,  very  simple

timber   offices   were  built,  as   the   Primary

Production  Department wanted to speed up  matters.

The  Department  promised the  merchants  concerned

that   after   two  years  the  office   would   be

reconstructed. Since the merchants co-operated with

the  Government,  they  did not  quarrel  with  the

Department about the facilities of the office.  Two

years have now elapsed, but there is still no  sign

of the building of new and spacious offices for the

fish  merchants in the Jurong Central Fish  Market.

Can  the Minister say whether there is any plan  in

hand  to  build  a larger office, or  any  plan  to

improve the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many large holes in the ground of the

fish  market. Some of them have been repaired,  but

other  smaller holes have appeared since then.  All

the  places in the Jurong Central Fish Market  need

to  be  washed  in order to keep it in  a  hygienic

condition.  We all know that a cemented ground  can

be washed easily and can withstand the splashing of

water. So when any development is made to this fish

market,  I  hope  the  surrounding  area  will   be

cemented so that it will facilitate washing.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the first

phase  of  the Jurong Fishing Port, the  Government

provided basic infrastructures such as the 750-foot

walk,  fish  landing equipment, auction market  and

distribution facilities. Several sites  within  the

fishing  port  complex have also been allocated  to

commercial companies for the establishment of  cold

storage and quick-freezing fishmeal production  and

ice-manufacturing facilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fish agents from Ellenborough and Clyde

Terrace  Markets  in  the city have  shifted  their

operations   to  Jurong.  Similarly,  all   lorries

transporting  fish  from West Malaysia  now  unload

fish  at  Jurong  instead of at various  places  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these increased activities, a

provision  of $200,000 for the Jurong Fishing  Port

for  next  year  is made for the extension  of  the

existing  wharf, improvement and expansion  of  the

fish   auction  market,  provision  of   additional

lighting for the wharf, purchase of pumps  to  make

use  of  sea water for cleaning purposes,  and  the

provision of market equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of a total of about 67,000 tons of fish

landed  last year in Singapore, the Jurong  Fishing

Port   handled   about  49,000  tons,   valued   at

approximately $39 million. Details of  imports  and

exports of fish are as follows:



<pre>

              Imports mostly from     Tons



	          Malaysia          40,655

	          Thailand           3,700

	          Taiwan             2,669

	          China              1,200

	          Korea                432

	          Other countries      617

                                    ------

	          Total imports     49,273

	                            ======

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for exports, we have been exporting to Italy,

Japan, the United States, Sarawak, Hong Kong, and a

few  other  places; the largest  exports  being  to

Italy, Japan and U.S.A. at a little over 1,000 tons

each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now deal with some of the points raised by

the  Member  for  Jurong.  The  Primary  Production

Department erected three blocks of temporary timber

offices  for  the  use of fish merchants  when  the

auction market was started. The department did  not

at  any time undertake to erect permanent buildings

for  them. In fact, the department is of  the  view

that  they  should erect their own facilities.  The

commercial companies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



engaged in the catching and auctioning of fish have

constructed  their  own offices  as  well  as  fish

processing  installations. However, the  department

is   prepared  to  recommend  to  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation,  which owns the land  at  the  fishing

port, to lease some land to any fish merchants  who

may  wish to construct their own permanent  offices

or  even  to the Fish Merchants General Association

for them to construct offices for their members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member also made mention of the

roads  in  the Jurong Fishing Port. The roads  have

been  badly damaged but they were recently  tarred,

work  having been completed in February this  year.

It  appears  that, because of the increase  in  the

large number of heavy vehicles going in and out  of

the  fishing port, the roads are subject  to  heavy

wear and tear, and maintenance is not easy and will

have to be more frequent if the roads are to be  in

serviceable condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for smells, the fishmeal factory belonging to

a  private  company was responsible  to  a  private

company  was responsible for some unpleasant  odour

at  the  fishing  port. Apparently there  were  two

major sources of smell: (1) from the steam released

into  the atmosphere; and (2) from the liquid waste

which  is  discharged  into a roadside  drain.  The

Ministry of Health has inspected the factory -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> I myself inspected the factory!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I beg the Minister's pardon. The

Minister  for Health inspected the factory  and  on

his  - I do not know whether to say recommendation,

advice  or  threat  the company has  condensed  the

steam  instead of releasing it into the atmosphere,

and  has  also taken steps to discharge the  liquid

waste  into  the sewer system instead of  into  the

open drain. The position now is satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I forget, I must now deal with the points

raised by the Member for Punggol. He has raised  so

many points



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



that  I must be forgiven if I forget some of  them.

As  to what I am doing at Kankar, for the moment  I

am  doing  nothing.  We  will  be  considering  the

petition  for  a jetty. If the funds  do  not  come

through to the Primary Production Department,  then

an application could be considered by the Urban and

Rural   Services  Committee.  But   it   would   be

difficult, as I realise, in a place like Kankar  to

land fish without a good jetty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

his  reply,  that whilst no other plans  are  being

envisaged  in Kankar, at least the jetty  is  being

considered. However, I must stress that  since  the

Primary  Production  Department  has  no  plans  to

develop  the Kankar Fish Market, the market  itself

is  in the process of developing more or less. Sir,

I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (7) *, Mr Teong Eng

Siong.  Are  you  going to repeat  what  the  other

Members have said, or add to what they have said?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have

something new to say. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 73 be

reduced by $100*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there should be a larger reduction in

the  vote  because the efficiency of the department

is  not  so  good.  There are  about  22  items  of

expenditure and the total vote is about $2 million,

which is quite a considerable sum of money. We know

that   the   Primary   Production   Department   is

responsible  for the development of our agriculture

and fisheries. The important question is whether it

has any plans to develop agriculture or fisheries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On fisheries, we all know that the Member for

Jurong  has said in this House some time  ago  that

about  two-thirds of the fish consumed is  imported

from abroad, For this we have to spend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



a  big  sum of money, amounting to $17 million  per

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister in charge of

this   department   some  questions   relating   to

fisheries. According to the estimates, there is one

item  called the Fishing Training Centre. I believe

there  is no plan to develop this centre, and  this

will  be of no use for the production of more  fish

for  local  consumption.  We  may  spend  about  $2

million  every  year  on fisheries,  but  how  much

benefit can we get from this expenditure'? Whatever

plans  there  may be to develop foreshore  fishing,

jetties, or what not, it seems that all these plans

have come to nothing. Therefore, I ask the Minister

whether  the department has any plans this year  to

develop  our  fisheries, that is  to  say,  whether

there can be any increase in the production of fish

locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also said that in recent years our agriculture has been declining. So I would like to ask him whether the department has any plans to develop our agriculture. The Member for Punggol has raised the point that

the  price  of eggs is too cheap, and the  Minister

has  said that when the price of eggs goes up, some

Members complain, and that when it goes down, other

people  complain  also.  He  complains  about   the

difficulties involved. Of course, when there  is  a

greater demand for certain items, the price  should

be better, It is my hope, however, that our farmers

will  get a better deal so that they may enjoy  and

have a share in our minor boom, or shall I say mini-prosperity. So if the price of eggs is too  low,  I

would  like to ask whether the Minister  in  charge

can consider a campaign to help raise the price  of

eggs  by  holding a "Eat More Eggs Week"  campaign,

because  eggs  are very nourishing as they  contain

vitamins and protein. I think it will be very  good

for  our  people in building a rugged  physique.  I

hope  the Minister can think of some ways  to  help

our  farmers to remedy the situation and  not  just

sit down and shake his leg.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has five minutes more to

go before "guillotine" time. Mr Ho Kah Leong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  support what the Member for Sembawang has  said.

However, I do not support his suggestion about  in-shore fishing, because I believe there are no large

quantities of fish along the sea coast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question to ask. Many farmers who have

been  resettled will not be allotted a large  piece

of land. They will be allotted about one or, at the

most, one and a half acres of land. The majority of

them get half or three-quarters of an acre of land.

It  is  not economical to grow vegetables or  other

agricultural produce on such a small plot of  land.

Some  farmers have already changed their  means  of

livelihood  and  are making use of  their  land  in

other  ways,  for  example, the  rearing  of  fancy

tropical  fish. Other farmers have planted orchids.

It  seems that the Primary Production Department is

not  quite definite about the measures to be  taken

in this connection. So I want to ask whether it can

give  support  to  the farmers by way  of  securing

foreign  markets  for their agricultural  products.

Thus  they  will  not be exploited by  unscrupulous

local middlemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether the Primary

Production Department can provide our farmers  with

cheap  fertilisers. This is one good  way  to  help

them  in  their horticultural production, otherwise

they  have to buy expensive fertilisers from  local

merchants.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary has

three minutes to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since  I have very little time  in  which  to

reply,  I  will be brief. There is nothing  new  in

what  the  Member  for  Sembawang  has  said.   For

instance,  we  have  debated  on  deep-sea  fishing

before. However, perhaps he was not here when  this

question was raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that the Primary Production

Department is not efficient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



in  its  work.  I would like him to  consider  this

point.  Our farmers are earning an income  of  $100

million  per year. If the department has  not  been

efficient,  how is it possible for the  farmers  to

earn so high an income as $100 million per year?  I

think  the  Member for Sembawang should  know  this

fact very well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other question is whether the department can

provide the farmers with cheap fertilisers to  help

them in their horticultural production. The Primary

Production  Department can recommend certain  types

of fertilisers to the farmers to use. But it cannot

sell  such fertilisers to them. It is not a profit-making department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's next question is about certain

farmers changing their means of livelihood. As  far

as  I know, there are still many farms in Singapore

which  need farmers. In fact, there are some  large

farms  which are short of staff. I think  that  the

change  of livelihood by some farmers in the  rural

areas is not a serious question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allocation of land to farmers, our

land  area  is  limited. Normally we allot  to  the

farmers affected half an acre to one acre of  land.

If  the Member for Jurong has any better method  to

get  large  areas of land, we can then  allot  more

land to our farmers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not

prepared  to  withdraw  my amendment,  because  the

Parliamentary  Secretary has  entirely  ignored  my

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,927,570 for Head 73 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 74 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 103.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 74 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst I welcome the big increase in the provision for roadside trees and shrubs, including the landscaping and improvement of open spaces and parks in the republic, I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Law and National Development to the planting of such

roadside trees and shrubs. Sir, it seems to me that

the  Parks  and Trees Division has no  creative  or

imaginative  ideas  about  planting  the  necessary

types  of  flowering shrubs or  roadside  trees  in

order  to  create the type of garden city  that  we

wish to have. I bring this matter up because I  see

that  although there has been a lot of planting  of

roadside  trees and shrubs, there seems  to  be  no

landscaping in the work. A lot of trees and  shrubs

are planted, but what do they represent'? There may

be  greenery, yes, but from the point  of  view  of

beauty or artistic appreciation, there is none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parks and Trees Division has also embarked

upon   a   scheme  whereby  commercial  firms   are

encouraged to maintain their plots of greenery, and

towards  that end flowering shrubs and  trees  have

been  planted in certain areas. I have seen one  or

two  of them, but I do not know whether or not they

are being regularly maintained. Sir, to spend a sum

of  no less than $1.2 million requires very careful

consideration.  There  must  be  creativeness   and

imagination in the planting of roadside  trees  and

shrubs  so that a truly green and beautiful  garden

city will come about.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Punggol is one of the very few who are dissatisfied

with  the  Garden City campaign. Perhaps we  should

recruit  him into the City Action Garden  Committee

and get some advice from him on landscaping.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to meet the accelerated programme

of  work and to secure better control, the whole of

Singapore  has  been divided into 14 administrative

complexes.  Each  complex is in  the  charge  of  a

horticultural officer with supporting staff to look

after  the  roadside  planting,  including  traffic

surfaces,  traffic islands, centre  dividers,  side

tables and any open spaces near the roadside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next fiscal year, it is planned to plant

an average of about 2,500 trees and 8,000 shrubs in

each complex. The estimated cost in each complex is

about $86,000. I can give the Member a list of  the

new parks, but I think I will be taking up the time

of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when trees are planted or when there is a

garden  city campaign, various opinions are voiced.

Some  like our methods, but others do not. However,

any suggestion from the Member for Punggol will  be

given  due  consideration by the head of  the  City

Action Garden Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I thank the Minister for his

kind  remarks.  I  was  not  actually  voicing   my

dissatisfaction  with  the planting  of  trees  and

shrubs  in the gardening campaign. What I said  was

that   perhaps   there  should   have   been   some

imagination  and creativeness in the  planting.  To

illustrate my point, Sir, there was a big signboard

at Punggol point which was eventually taken down. I

asked  for  some  flowering shrubs  to  be  planted

there.  However, when I went up there. I could  not

see  the shrubs although I was told that there were

shrubs.  I  looked further. I went down  the  steps

leading to the jetty and there I found a few  trees

and shrubs planted. That was not exactly the idea I

had in mind. I was not consulted on this matter. If

the  Minister  says  I can be  co-opted  into  this

garden  committee,  I will be happy  to  offer  any

services  that  I can. With these  remarks,  I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 75 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 75 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item 005 of subhead

201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that this is the Public Works

Department's  first experience in the  construction

of  a flyover road system. I would like to ask  the

Minister  concerned whether there are  any  studies

made  since  this road system was first  opened  at

Jalan    Toa   Payoh/New   Town   Southern   Access

Interchange  to  see whether this system  is  safe,

including the surface condition. I notice that part

of  this  road is very badly pitted  and  it  is  a

source  of  danger to road users. There is  a  very

sharp  bend  at this flyover which is also  another

source of danger for road users. I am informed that

quite  a  number  of accidents have occurred  along

this  bend.  Two  vehicles so far have  overturned,

fortunately without any loss of life. It is a  pity

that   this  Pan-Island  Expressway  is  so  poorly

constructed.  It  is true that some  minor  repairs

have  been  done to the road surface. But,  at  the

moment,  many of these repairs are on the point  of

breaking   up  again.  I  would  ask  the  Minister

concerned whether any appropriate measures will  be

taken to rectify these faults.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Sir, Jalan Toa Payoh/ New Town

Southern  Access  Interchange is the  major  access

into Toa Payoh New Town from Jalan Toa Payoh. Jalan

Toa Payoh is just a part of the proposed Pan-Island

Expressway   and,   in   order   to   provide    an

uninterrupted  flow  of  traffic  along  Jalan  Toa

Payoh,  a  flyover  was constructed.  This  flyover

permits  free right-turn movements from  Jalan  Toa

Payoh  into  Toa  Payoh New Town and  vice  versa.

Since  the  right-turn traffic  at  this  point  is

separated  and  provided for  at  two  levels,  the

accident risks are reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to accident statistics obtained from

the  Accidents Branch, Traffic Police,  only  three

accidents  have  occurred  near  Jalan  Toa   Payoh

flyover and 10 accidents near Kim Keat Road  during

the period 1st January, 1970, to the 28th February,

1971.  That is a period of 14 months, According  to

the  Accidents Branch, these few accidents were due

to  carelessness of either the pedestrians  or  the

drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jalan Toa Payoh was constructed largely over

swamp land. A considerable amount of filling had to

be  carried out and hence, over a period of  years,

there  has been continuous settlement of the earth.

And  this has given rise to unevenness of the  road

surface  and  the road breaking up in  some  parts.

Because of the continued construction taking  place

in and around Toa Payoh New Town, permanent repairs

have  not  yet  been carried out.  Various  service

departments  have been laying services along  Jalan

Toa  Payoh. I assure the Member that as soon as all

such  works are completed, the entire road will  be

properly resurfaced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with

the Minister's reply and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 75 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 206.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sum allocated for item 001 of subhead

206  is  $50,000 for the improvement  of  Sembawang

Road  from  10  m.s. to 13 m.s., which  includes  Nee

Soon.  Because of the widening of the road in  this

area, some shops are to be demolished. For example,

in  the  Sembawang area, more than  100  shops  are

affected by the widening of the road. As the Member

of  Parliament  for that area, I am very  concerned

with  this  plan. This also includes the  Nee  Soon

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some questions to ask the Parliamentary

Secretary  concerned. Firstly, when will the  road-widening project be expected to commence? About 100

shops  are affected in the Sembawang area,  to  say

nothing  of  the  Thomson and Nee Soon  areas.  Are

there any plans to resettle those who are affected?

I  would  like  to  suggest  to  the  Parliamentary

Secretary that before the project is started, it is

better  to  build  some shophouses  for  resettling

those  who are affected by the project, which  will

reduce their sufferings and difficulties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, plans for

the  widening  of Sembawang Road from  Mandai  Road

junction,  9½ m.s., to Canberra Gate,  13  m.s.,  are

being finalised. Work is expected to commence  next

year  as  soon as buildings and structures affected

by  the road widening can be cleared and resettled.

Clearance action is being taken by the Resettlement

Department  of  the Housing and Development  Board.

The usual resettlement assistance and terms will be

offered to affected residents and shopkeepers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since the

Parliamentary Secretary has given me a satisfactory

answer, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 75 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item 001 of  subhead

211.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this sum is meant for the widening of Jalan

Ahmad  Ibrahim.  This is a major thoroughfare  from

the  city  area to Jurong Town. At the moment,  this

road  is  a dual carriageway. In Jurong, there  are

more than 200 factories and there are many workers.

At  peak hours, the traffic along this road is very

heavy.  If  there is an accident,  very  often  the

traffic jam created is two or three miles long.  If

there  is  a factory fire, as the Member for  River

Valley  has said, before the fire-engine can arrive

at  the  scene of the fire, the factory  will  have

already  been razed to the ground. So the  road  is

too  narrow at the moment. In the estimate for  the

coming  financial year, we finally see a  vote  for

$500,000 for the widening of Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. I

believe that all the people working in Jurong  town

will  be very happy about it. I would like to  know

how  many traffic lanes will be built and when  the

work is expected to commence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as to the last question, work

will  commence  in the middle of this  year.  Jalan

Ahmad  Ibrahim  was  constructed  when  the  Jurong

Industrial Estate was first developed. In the early

years of Jurong, traffic using the road was limited

and  therefore only two lanes for traffic going  up

to  and  two lanes for traffic leaving Jurong  were

constructed  with adequate reserve  set  aside  for

future  widening.  With the  rapid  development  in

Jurong,  the  traffic  using Jalan  Ahmad  Ibrahim,

which  is  at present the main arterial  road  from

Jurong  into the city, has increased by  leaps  and

bounds.  It is essential, therefore, to  widen  the

road  to cope with the increased traffic. In  fact,

it will be a dual carriageway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his answer. I beg leave

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 75 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 307.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to draw the

attention of the Minister to the fact that many  of

the existing roads need urgent repairs; repairs  in

the  sense that I have noticed that quite a  number

of  roads which have been dug up and repaired, have

become bumpy as a result. Take Punggol Road  as  an

example.  Certain  stretches are quite  bumpy,  and

when   complaints  are  made,  the   Public   Works

Department  steps in to patch up some of  the  pot-holes. As a result of this patching up, you get the

bumps. Sir, I wonder whether the Ministry has plans

to  resurface  Punggol Road which is in  very  dire

need of resurfacing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.45 p. m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I gave the Member

the answer when replying to one of his questions in

respect  of  the widening of Punggol  Road.  I  did

assure him that repairs would be undertaken to keep

the  roads in a satisfactory condition for  use  by

traffic,  and  that a feasibility  study  into  the

widening  of Punggol Road was being done.  I  agree

with  the Member that quite a few of our roads  are

bumpy, as a result of some department digging  them

up  either  in respect of water mains,  electricity

mains    or   even   telephone   cables.   It    is

unsatisfactory  to  see a nice  new  road  recently

widened  and  then,  not even a month  later,  some

department  comes along and digs it up.  When  they

fill  it  up, obviously they cannot make it  level.

They  will  have  to fill it up  a  little  higher,

otherwise the level sinks. So, as a result, quite a

few  of our roads have these bumps which remain for

a very long time until the whole length of the road

is  resurfaced  completely. There  is  a  Road  Co-ordination   Committee,  comprising   the   service

departments, such as the Singapore Telephone Board,

the  Public  Utilities Board and the  Public  Works

Department. This is to ensure that there is maximum

coordination. In fact, no one now is allowed to dig

up  a  newly-resurfaced road or a newly built  road

within  a  period  of one year  when  the  work  is

completed, unless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



they  get the permission of the Director of  Public

Works.   Sometimes   this  permission   cannot   be

withheld, especially when a water main bursts.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 75 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 311.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns Phase II of the approach roads

and car parks for the Kallang sports complex. It is

scheduled to be completed in 1971-72 and  the  sum

of  $750,000 is now voted for this purpose. What  I

wish  to know is the location of this Phase  II  of

the  approach roads and car parks for  the  Kallang

sports complex and what will become of the existing

road  off Mountbatten Road leading to Kallang Park.

Will the Minister clarify this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the first phase of the approach

roads  and  car parks to the National  Stadium  was

completed at the end of 1970 and is now open to the

public.  The  second  phase,  including  car   park

facilities,  is expected to be completed  in  March

1972.  The implementation of the second phase  will

complete  the  road system for the  Kallang  sports

complex  and will include another car  park  for  a

thousand  cars. In addition to this, bus bays  will

also  be  provided  in  the  car  park  for  a  bus

terminus.  Half of the old runway from  Mountbatten

Road  to  another  road parallel  to  Jalan  Benaan

Kapal, together with a big parking scheme and other

link  roads,  will constitute the second  phase  of

this  project.  The other half of the  runway  will

become  part of the pedestrian mall in the  stadium

complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the old runway is being used as an

access  into Kallang Park. However, in view of  the

implementation  of  the second  phase,  it  is  not

proposed   to  reconstruct  this  runway.   Traffic

wanting access into Kallang Park can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



by-pass the runway by using Jalan Benaan Kapal.  In

fact, this has already been used as a bus route. In

the meantime, very bad pot-holes in the runway will

be  patched up as and when necessary. If the Member

seeks further details, I have a sketch plan which I

will be glad to show to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the subject matter "Urban and Rural

Services"  under  Head  78  provides  yet   another

classic  example of the lopsided mentality  of  the

Ministry of National Development. The provision  of

a  meagre sum of only $450,000 for agricultural and

kampong roads is out of logical proportion when one

compares  this  "chicken-feed" of  a  mere  half  a

million  dollars  to the funds  allocated  for  the

Parks and Trees Division in the same Ministry.  One

cannot  help but wonder if the Ministry of National

Development   has  actually  lost  its   sense   of

judgement,  or has acquired a somewhat queer  sense

of  priority over the years. Let me invite  Members

to  take a quick look at the amount of public funds

set aside for our city beautification projects:

The   total,   together  with  another   $1,560,000

provided in the Ordinary Estimates, gives  a  grand

total of $5,860,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not without any sense of aesthetic

preference,  and  I  certainly would  not  want  to

create the impression that I am out to torpedo this

fine project of beautifying our city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we have now reached a stage where

gracious  living has become the common  aspirations

of the middle and upper income groups. So be it. It

is not a sin for anyone who has the means to seek a

more profitable and gracious living, but let us not

forget  to look at the other side of the  coin -- the

less colourful and less glamorous side of the happy

facade. Would not the rural people be entitled to a

better deal, if only it means a little slice of the

cream?  Does  the Ministry of National  Development

really  believe  that  a  mere  miserable  sum   of

$450,000,  which  is not even 10 per  cent  of  the

monies   to  be  spent  on  parks  and  trees,   is

sufficient to build or repair the rural and kampong

roads?  My  constituency alone requires many  times

more  than  that. The rural folks  are  simple  and

their  wants  modest.  Whilst  we  enjoy  what  the

Minister for Finance has said to be a mild or mini-boom, would not a little more be spent on the  poor

rural  folks?  Would  we  be  asking  too  much  or

unreasonably  demanding  too  exorbitantly  of  the

Government to plough back just that little bit more

so  as  to make life for the rural people a  little

bit  easier? May I reiterate that the needs of  the

rural people are indeed minimal. I would not burden

the  House by, relating any further hardship of the

farmers  and the fishermen, for my other colleagues

have  in the past few days adequately informed this

House.  It  is all very well for the Government  to

say  that  it  is  preoccupied with other  priority

matters in restructuring our economy in the face of

the  British  pullout,  but  a  somewhat  apathetic

attitude towards the rural people is something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



that surprises me, because we have said so much and

claimed  to  be  able to do so much for  the  rural

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are roads built several years ago, but they

were  constructed  on  the standard  classified  as

"kampong  and  rural  roads", which  means  a  mere

surfacing of the track of land without a foundation

at  all. This method of constructing kampong  roads

might  well suit the needs of the people, but after

several heavy rainfalls, the surface of these roads

is  washed away and potholes appear after  a  short

time. The condition of the roads then is not better

than what it was before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always an agonising experience for the

rural folks, like the farmers and even their wives,

to have to transport heavy loads of farm produce to

market  over these roads, not to mention the little

children who use the roads on their way to  school.

The  situation  is  even worse during  the  monsoon

season when the farmers and their children have  to

struggle to find their way home in a tortuous  way.

Would   not  the  Government  consider   a   better

construction  method, such as laying  a  foundation

for  these  roads so that they can last longer  and

provide easy access for the farmers and the country

folks?  It  is  easy  for us as  city  dwellers  to

neglect  this aspect of the rural life as  we  move

around  the town in cars and other modern modes  of

transport   over  one  of  the  best   roads   ever

constructed in this part of the world. I  sincerely

urge  the  Minister  to be a  little  generous  and

sympathetic  towards the rural  people  who,  after

all,  do contribute in whatever small way they  can

towards  the  building of our republic.  They  have

done  nothing  wrong  to justify  the  second-class

treatment from the Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho Kah Leong, are you talking

on the same item?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of what the Member for Changi

has said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> For your information Mr Ho,

"guillotine" time is 6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

having  heard what the Member for Changi has  said,

not  only do we feel sorry about the present policy

of the Government in regard to the rural areas, but

we  also feel that we have not done enough for  the

rural  people.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the

Government has all this time been claiming that  it

has  been  doing  a  lot for the rural  people,  in

actual  fact it has been doing more for  the  urban

people than the rural people, as pointed out by the

Member for Changi.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amount of money spent on beautifying our city area exceeds by ten times the sum allotted for the roads in the rural areas. I would like to remind the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary that the rural people also pay taxes. They do not just sit down and enjoy the

fruits  given  by  the  Government.  So  they   are

entitled to ask for better roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also endorse the view of the Member for

Changi  when  he  says  that  this  meagre  sum  of

$450,000  is far from adequate for the construction

of roads in the rural areas. From my own experience

over  the  past few years, I know that  unless  the

roads  in  the rural areas are metalled,  they  are

useless  and  the  money spent on  making  them  is

wasted, because after a monsoon or a heavy downpour

they will be badly affected and a lot of money will

have  to  go  towards repairing them. Therefore,  I

propose  that  the Government should allocate  more

money  for  the  rural roads. I am not  asking  too

much, but Government should spend as much money  on

them  as they are spending on beautifying the  city

or  building  more  gardens. At least  they  should

spend what is necessary for metalling them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of

$450,000  is  allocated under  this  Head  for  the

construction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



and  repair of agricultural and kampong  roads.  If

this  sum  is found inadequate, more money  can  be

transferred  from the other items  under  the  same

subhead.  There  is no need, therefore,  to  divert

funds  allocated for the beautifying of  Singapore,

which   is   equally  important,  as  our  hitherto

fruitful  efforts to make Singapore a  garden  city

should be sustained and intensified further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure the House that, despite a

certain  sum  of  money set aside to  beautify  our

city,  the Government's efforts to help the kampong

people will continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

much  can  be done by setting aside even the  whole

vote  for this Head, which is only $2,475,000,  for

road   building   and  repairing.   How   can   the

Parliamentary  Secretary tackle the  more  than  10

rural  constituencies, where the roads  were  built

some  four or five years ago, with only $2 million?

Therefore, we ask that the Ministry listen  to  all

the  Members from the rural constituencies who  are

pleading  for  more  money  to  be  allocated   for

building and repairing roads. That is what  we  are

interested in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite

agree  that we have to provide more money  for  the

repair  of  roads or other services  in  the  rural

areas.  Sir,  I  have  a brief here  regarding  the

outstanding  requests  submitted  through  all  the

constituencies which were deferred from last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Some of them are four years

old!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> There are about 106

outstanding  requests amounting to  $1.75  million.

So,  according to the 1971-72 provision, the  urban

and  rural  services come to about $2.7 million.  I

think   that  adequately  provides  for   all   the

projects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

can the Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



Secretary   inform  this  House  of  the   deferred

applications - what sort of applications they  are,

and  whether  the present allocation is  enough  to

meet  the requirements of the deferred applications

for services to be provided?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Yes, we can meet all the

outstanding requests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, in spite of the effort

made  by the Parliamentary Secretary to answer this

very difficult question, I hope that he, being also

the  Chairman  of  the  Urban  and  Rural  Services

Committee,  will give his fullest  support  to  our

request  and  provide all Members  from  the  rural

constituencies  with an easier or better  means  of

dealing  with our constituencies. Sir, I beg  leave

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I do not quite follow the

Parliamentary Secretary's remark that  there  is  a

provision  of  $2.7  million for  urban  and  rural

services  in 1971-72. In actual fact,  it  is  only

$2.475  million.  He says that  this  provision  is

adequate  to cover all the outstanding requests  by

all  the  constituencies. In other words,  what  he

means  possibly is the requests from the  urban  as

well as the rural constituencies. But I do not know

whether  he  realises  that there  are  still  more

requests  to come as a result, and therefore,  this

provision of $ 2.475 million is grossly inadequate.

I  note,  with  gratitude, that  the  Minister  for

Finance is here with us at this moment, and I would

urge him to give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



us   some  sympathy.  When  I  say  "give  us  some

sympathy",  I  mean I can safely  speak  for  those

Members  who  come from the rural areas,  including

the  Minister of State for Finance who  comes  from

Choa  Chu  Kang. He is nodding his  head,  too,  in

approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the point of making requests to the

Urban  and Rural Services Committee, I think it  is

high  time the U.R.S.C. formulated a new method  by

which  requests  can be considered  as  quickly  as

possible  and not through the District  Committees.

In  other  words, processing requests  through  the

District Committees invariably causes a lot of time

being used up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I come to my point about the extension

of  water  supply  as  well as electricity  supply?

Members may care to note that an amount of $382,900

was  unspent  last year on the extension  of  water

supply.  I  am sure the Parliamentary Secretary  is

fully aware that there are requests that have  been

outstanding for several years. The reason why these

requests have been outstanding for so many years is

simply  that they could not be met as a  result  of

the   costs  involved.  And  the  Urban  and  Rural

Services  Committee was a bit reluctant to consider

favourably these requests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to electricity supply. The provision

of  $50,000,  I  take  it, is  a  subsidy  for  the

electrification  scheme, but I am  disappointed  to

note that of late the Electricity Department of the

Public  Utilities  Board  has  not  been  able   to

implement  the  various  electrification   schemes,

thereby causing delays of up to two years. I  think

the  Parliamentary Secretary does have a  list,  or

maybe  two  lists which have been prepared  by  the

P.U.B.  Electricity Department indicating how  they

will be implementing such electrification schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Members of Parliament for the rural

areas  know that these requests for electricity  as

well  as water supplies, and, for that matter,  the

making  up of agricultural and kampong roads,  have

been made quite some time ago. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



"quite some time ago", as the Member for Changi has

remarked -means four or five years ago. And some of

these requests are still outstanding. The reason is

quite  simple.  The funds allocated  to  the  rural

constituencies  are paltry, negligible  sums.  Does

the  Parliamentary Secretary mean to say  that  the

rural  folk should not enjoy the same amenities  as

those enjoyed by the city folk? The rural folk, for

the  information  of  the Parliamentary  Secretary,

also  pay the same rates as those paid by the  city

folk  for water and electricity supplies. They  pay

the  full  rate not just the domestic  rate  alone,

especially the farmers..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In winding up my speech, so as to give the

Parliamentary Secretary sufficient time to reply, I

would  urge, should this provision be insufficient,

that  the Urban and Rural Services Committee should

not  hesitate  to  ask  for  more  money  from  the

Minister  for  Finance in order to  accede  to  the

requests made from the rural constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, there is a revote of

$382,900  as some water supply projects which  were

approved during the current financial year have not

yet  been  completed, and bills have not  yet  been

presented  for payment. It is expected  that  these

bills  will  be  received and paid  in  the  coming

financial  year. Priority will be  given  to  water

supply  projects which cost less but  benefit  more

people.  Projects  which cost $50,000  or  $60,000,

which  means they are big projects, and which  will

benefit comparatively less people will be given low

priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have two types of water supply projects. One is to lay water sub-mains in areas now served by public stand-pipes, so that the residents can make individual water connections into their houses and later, when water supply is available in the houses, to remove the public stand-pipes. The other type is to lay water mains in

areas  not  served now with pipe-water.  The  first

type of project is usually given priority over  the

second  type  as  it is the policy  to  remove  all

public standpipes and prevent wastage of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 109



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this new provision is for the Rehabilitation

Centre  for Hemiplegics and Paraplegics at Mandalay

Road,  Tan Tock Seng Hospital. I would like to  ask

the Minister for Health what is the purpose and the

scope  of  this centre. I notice this is the  first

time  that the Government has come into the picture

in rehabilitating hemiplegics and paraplegics. Sir,

I  wonder whether the Minister for Health  has  any

plans  to assist those welfare organisations  which

look after such cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

proposal  to  establish  a  centre  for  paraplegic

patients  was under study by my Ministry  early  in

1969.  At  that time it was envisaged  to  build  a

hospital  or  paraplegic  centre  for  long-staying

patients and a sheltered workshop. However, in late

1969  this proposal was expanded to include medical

as well as surgical rehabilitation. This called for

a  revision  of the plan and the estimates  of  the

cost.  The  revision was not finalised  until  July

1970 and, therefore, it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



too  late for the proposals to be included  in  the

1970-71  estimates. That is the reason why  it  has

appeared   for  the  first  time  in  this   year's

estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the scope of the centre, may I say

that at the moment paraplegics and hemiplegics  are

being  admitted  or  treated  at  the  Outram  Road

General Hospital, the Thomson Road General Hospital

and  the  Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Most of  the  in-patients  invariably remain in the hospital  for  a

long  period  of time for the purpose of  receiving

effective care, and this has resulted in the number

of  hospital beds being correspondingly reduced for

use  by  other  more acute cases for whom  hospital

treatment  is particularly needed, If  there  is  a

centre  where  such patients can be taken  care  of

exclusively, it will result in a number of beds  in

the  hospitals being released for other medical and

surgical  cases.  The paraplegics  and  hemiplegics

will  also  be able to leave the hospital  earlier,

saving two to three months of hospitalisation,  and

Government funds accordingly. Hence, the purpose of

the  centre is twofold. First, to relieve the acute

shortage  of  hospital  beds by  discharging  long-staying paraplegic and hemiplegic patients from the

hospitals  to  the  centre and second,  to  provide

facilities  for a more positive way for paraplegics

and  hemiplegics  to rehabilitate  themselves.  The

centre  will provide accommodation to cater for  70

to  80  in-patients  as well as rehabilitation  for

outpatients and for surgical and medical cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the aid which my Ministry is giving to the

voluntary welfare organisations concerned with  the

rehabilitation of physically disabled persons,  may

I  say that at the moment my Ministry exempts  from

hospital  charges  and outpatient  charges  certain

categories   of   patients   from   the   following

organisations:    (1)   the   Spastic    Children's

Association  of  Singapore: (2) the Cheshire  Home:

(3)   the   Singapore  Red  Cross  for  Handicapped

Children:  (4)  the Singapore Association  for  the

Blind;  (5) the Singapore Association for  Retarded

Children; and (6) the Singapore Association for the

Deaf and Dumb.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, medico-socio workers from my

Ministry contribute to the activities of the  first

five voluntary organisations which I have mentioned

above, and the Society for Aid to the Paralysed, by

serving  on  their committees at different  levels,

such  as  executive case work, admission to  homes,

employment and management. The Government  makes  a

yearly   financial   grant   to   some   of   these

organisations.  The  following  amounts  have  been

provided in the 1971-72 estimates:



<pre>

                                               $

(1)The Singapore Red Cross

     Home for Handicapped

     Children                               20,200

(2)The Singapore Association

     for the Deaf and

     Dumb                                   12,000

(3)The Spastic Children's Association

     of Singapore                            4,200

</pre>



I   believe  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  the

Ministry  of Social Affairs have also provided  aid

in  the  form  of sending instructors  and  welfare

teachers to these organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

million  is  for the purchase of vehicles  for  the

Public  Cleansing Service and Environmental  Public

Health. My



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



question is this: I wonder whether the Minister for

Health  is  aware that a good number of the  public

cleansing   vehicles   need  cleaning   themselves,

because   I  have  come  across  several  of   them

travelling along Upper Serangoon Road and not  only

are  they  dirty looking but a lot of watery  waste

drips from them as they pass by on their way to the

Tampines  dumping  ground.  Sir,  there  have  been

campaigns  such  as "Keep Singapore  Clean",  "Keep

Singapore  Clean and Green"; "Keep Singapore  Clean

and  Pollution  Free". Action has also  been  taken

against  people  who do not obey the  law  to  keep

Singapore  clean. However, I hope that  before  the

Ministry of Health takes any action against the law-breakers it should put its own house in order, that

is, keep its own vehicles clean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder whether the Minister for Health is

aware that the collection of refuse and garbage  is

very  inadequate. There are several bin centres  in

my   area  for  which  there  is  only  one   daily

collection. But the bin centres will be again  full

before  the next day. I hope that with the purchase

of  more  public cleansing vehicles, the  situation

will be remedied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of refuse treatment

and  disposal plants. I note with very deep  regret

that  the  token vote of $10 is still a  revote.  I

shall  be  grateful if the Minister  can  enlighten

this House on what this $10 token vote is for.  How

can  the  Ministry  conduct any study  into  refuse

treatment  and disposal plants with this  $10?  Are

there  going  to be refuse treatment  and  disposal

plants in the republic, and, if so, where are they?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that the

provision  under  subhead 603 has been  reduced  by

$96,500  for  this year. I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  for  Health  whether  this  provision  is

sufficient to meet the needs of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



the public cleansing service. As far as I know, the

number  of  lorries  for removing  garbage  is  not

sufficient.  I  had occasion to observe  privately-owned  lorries hired by the Ministry of  Health  to

remove garbage. These lorries are not suitable  for

the purpose. I have seen garbage spilling on to the

road  from  such lorries. Such a state  of  affairs

will  not  help to improve the cleanliness  of  our

roads. On the contrary, our roads will become dirty

when these lorries pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I wish to touch upon is that the

workers of the Public Cleansing Department are  not

supplied   with  the  necessary  tools,   such   as

changkols,  scythes,  knives,  etc, to  clean  the

drains  in  the rural areas. I myself have  noticed

that the workers engaged in cleaning the drains  in

the Geylang Serai area are handicapped for lack  of

tools  and  so are not able to cut away  the  thick

growth of grass which is choking up the drains. The

result  is  that  the drains have  become  breeding

grounds  for mosquitoes. This is one of the reasons

why  there are many mosquitoes in the Geylang Serai

area. The workers lack the necessary tools to carry

out  their  work properly. I hope the Minister  for

Health  will do what is necessary to overcome  this

shortcoming.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

reply  to  the  point about the inadequacy  of  the

allocation  for the purchase of the refuse  removal

vehicles.  I  agree  with  the  Member   that   the

allocation is not sufficient. In fact, we  did  ask

for  $2.5  million,  but we were  given  only  $1.5

million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Passing back the buck to the

Minister for Finance!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> No, we are not passing the

buck  back.  We  always carry the  "bucks"  to  the

Tampines  dumping  ground! We have  to  carry  them

there.  I  must  sympathise  with  the  Member  for

Punggol   because  he  happens  to  be  in  Punggol

Constituency where the dumping ground is situated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the reduced allocation, we can

only  purchase vehicles proportionate to the amount

of  the  allocation which we have  been  given.  In

fact,  working on the actual volume  of  refuse  we

have collected from the beginning of this year,  we

estimate that the volume of refuse per day would be

1,375  tons. We therefore require an additional  37

refuse  collectors, 15 covered crane wagons and  15

covered tippers with cranes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about refuse

vehicles  themselves  being  dirty,  and  that  the

Ministry  of  Health is not keeping its  own  house

clean,  may I say that, as far as I know - I  think

the  Member for Punggol must admit it -nowadays the

refuse vehicles are much cleaner than they used  to

be. Perhaps the Member might have seen a few refuse

vehicles which might not be that clean. As  I  have

always  said, we have of course black  sheep  among

our  employees. I shall therefore be very  grateful

to  the  Member for Punggol if he will be  diligent

enough  to  take down the numbers of  the  vehicles

which are dirty.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Your Ministry's officials should

keep  an  eye  on them. I am not employed  to  look

after your Ministry!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> We have our inspectors who

will  be keeping an eye on these vehicles.  But  we

feel  that  it  will be helpful  to  us  if,  as  a

responsible  member of the public, the  Member  for

Punggol  will lend us a hand if he happens  to  see

any refuse vehicle which is not clean and note down

its number. I am sure he is that public-spirited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I will.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Good. As regards the

complaint   about  some  of  the  refuse   vehicles

dripping  liquid as they go along, may I say  that,

in  fact, this is caused by the refuse which we get

from  the  markets and households. It is  very  wet

refuse. But in order that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



capacity of the refuse trucks can take advantage of

holding more refuse inside and thus cutting down on

haulage  costs,  the  refuse  is  compressed.   And

because of the compression, liquid comes out.  This

is  unavoidable. But our order to the crews of  the

refuse vehicles is that the compression should take

place when the wagon is stationary and not while it

is moving. Again, if the Member for Punggol sees  a

moving refuse vehicle which is dripping liquid, can

he also lend us a hand by giving us its number?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I have only two hands to lend!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I believe the Member for

Punggol is a man of many parts; and I am quite sure

he will do us this service!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought up by the Member for Geylang

Serai  is that he saw some open, wagons which  were

hired  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  for  carrying

refuse,  and the wagons were such that  the  refuse

was  blown off. That is not the case at the moment.

That  could  have been the case in  the  past  when

there was a shortage of refuse vehicles. And it was

inevitable  that we had to hire open lorries  which

were  not  suitable for carrying refuse.  But  this

could  not  be  avoided,  and  whenever  such  open

lorries   were   hired  to  carry  refuse,   strict

instructions  were given to cover the  refuse  with

canvas  so that no refuse could be blown off.  Here

again  if  the  Member for Geylang Serai  is  civic

conscious  enough  and  he sees  any  such  lorries

passing by, we will be extremely grateful if he can

give us the number of the vehicle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  this kind of complaint is made, perhaps we  may

not be able to see the Minister in his office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member does not have

to see me to put in a complaint. He can easily post

it to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> That will be too late.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is not too late at all. He

can  just give us the number of the lorry, the time

and date when it happened, and that is good enough.

Sir, I think I have answered all the points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> What about refuse treatment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I am sorry I missed that

point. As far as refuse treatment is concerned, may

I  say  that since last year when I spoke  on  this

subject  brought up by the Member for  Punggol,  we

have  progressed a stage further.  At  the  moment,

there  is  a firm of consulting engineers  who  are

doing  a  survey  to  ascertain the  most  suitable

method   or  combination  of  methods  for   refuse

disposal in Singapore. Their report is expected  to

be  submitted on the 10th of April. May I say  that

the   proposals  are  whether  we  should  go   for

incineration  or  for a compacting  plant.  It  has

taken some time to do this survey, because this  is

not  a matter which we can treat in a light-hearted

manner,  as  all the factors have to be considered.

If  I  may inform the House, one incineration plant

which  can  incinerate 1,000 tons of refuse  a  day

will cost something like $20 to $25 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need explain the alternative

methods of refuse disposal. I have dealt with  them

quite  comprehensively last year and I do not  wish

to repeat them again.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Rahmat Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister has not answered  the  question

about   the  shortage  of  implements  for   public

cleansing workers to clean the drains.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, it is not true that

cleansing  workers  do  not have  access  to  these

implements.  In fact, if Members see them  working,

they  always  have a broom and a  spade.  They  are

supposed to shovel out the refuse from the  drains.

There  is no excuse for them to say that they  have

no  access  to  any  implements, because  they  are

available. If they do not have the implements, they

can approach the overseer and ask for them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 703.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a vote for the development and

improvement  to markets and hawkers' sites.  As  we

all  know  and as we can see around a  new  market,

there  are  stalls selling cooked food.  Dirty  and

torn  tarpaulins  are  used as  roofing  for  these

stalls  and  they are a very ugly sight, especially

when they are in a new market. Therefore, I am glad

to  note  that recently the Ministry of Health  has

taken   steps  to  put  up  new  hawker  sites   to

accommodate these hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to the Minister

that  the wash basins and other facilities provided

should be practical for the hawker sites. Otherwise

the  money  spent will be wasted. I  can  give  one

example,  Sir. In my constituency, in Taman  Jurong

Market  I,  the  shelters put up  for  cooked  food

stalls  are  not large enough to cover the  hawkers

from  the sun or the rain. It is as good as  having

no  shelter. Because of this, the hawkers  have  to

use  their  own canvas and tarpaulins for  shelter.

The   wash   basins  provided  are   not   properly

constructed  and  inadequate for their  use.  As  a

result, the hawkers do not make good use of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about the water supply to the

dressed poultry sellers. At present, the anti-waste

type  of  taps are provided. Whenever they want  to

use  water,  they have to press for it. They  would

rather  have the ordinary taps which can be  turned

on  for  water when they pluck off the feathers  of

the  chickens  and ducks. I suggest  that  ordinary

taps  be constructed for them instead of anti-waste

taps.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite

agree  with some of the remarks made by the  Member

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



Jurong  about the unsightly hawker stalls  and  the

shelters which they erect. In fact, these  are  the

stalls  which are situated in the concourse of  the

market; they are not in the market itself.  As  far

as  the  stalls in the market proper are concerned,

they  are  properly  sheltered  and  ventilated.  I

presume the Member for Jurong is referring  to  the

market  in  his  constituency. This is  the  market

which  I myself visited last year during the  "Keep

Singapore Clean and Pollution Free" Campaign and  I

know  the problems that we face in this market.  In

fact,  the  hawker  stalls  are  situated  in   the

concourse of the market. The concourse of a  market

is  not  a place for hawker stalls. These makeshift

measures were put up by the hawkers themselves  and

they   result   in   unsightly  and  unsatisfactory

shelters. Under these difficult circumstances,  the

Hawkers  Department of the Ministry  is  doing  its

very best to provide washing facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that, in view of all these experiences,

the  new markets which are built are of an improved

design. If I may explain here, normally when  there

is a market for market produce, we have a gathering

of unauthorised hawkers who sell cooked food around

the  market. And these are the cooked food  hawkers

who  are  resettled in the concourse of the  market

which  is  not  built for such a purpose.  But  the

design of the new markets is such that we build not

only  market for market produce but also a  section

for  cooked  food. And the cooked food  stalls  are

built  in  such a way that each stall has  its  own

washing area with drains leading into the sewers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low is not here. Mr Teong,

amendment No. (2)*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Yeow Chong.)



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 003*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Yeow Chong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead relates to a loan to the

Housing   and   Development  Board   amounting   to

$100,000,000. Since its inception, the Housing  and

Development  Board has been providing  cheap  flats

for  our  people. It has achieved  a  lot  in  this

respect.   In   recent  years   the   Housing   and

Development Board has introduced the Home Ownership

Scheme  to provide low-cost housing for the  poorer

people.  The  workers can now  make  use  of  their

Central Provident Fund money to make a down-payment

for the flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received quite a number of complaints

about  the high rentals charged by the Housing  and

Development  Board. The complaints come  especially

from  people who are affected by the urban  renewal

projects  and who have to move to the  Housing  and

Development  Board flats which are  rented  out  at

high rates. Ordinary shops are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



rented  out  at  $300-$400 a month, whereas  coffee

shops  and eating houses are rented out at  between

$1,500 and $2,000 a month. These high rentals  will

put  them in great difficulties. Therefore, I  have

two  suggestions to make to the Minister and I hope

he  will  consider them. Their implementation  will

remedy the situation to some extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can the Minister consider the sale of shop

premises  in the same way as the Government  is

selling  Housing Board flats to people on  hire

purchase? In this way, the Government need not ask

for loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Government can thus use the proceeds of

the  sales  to  supplement further construction  of

such  shop  premises so that they do  not  need  to

increase the rents. This will reduce the burden  of

the  renters of the shop premises. Very  often  the

traders  cannot cover the rental from the  proceeds

of  their  trade.  I  hope the Minister  will  give

consideration to the two suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what I

intended  to  raise has already been raised  during

the  earlier  debate on the Housing and Development

Board flats. So I am not speaking now.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the suggestion

by  the  Member for Sembawang that is the  sale  of

shop  premises by the Housing and Development Board

to   the   occupiers  or  tenants,  there  is   one

difficulty.  This  is with regard to  non-citizens.

The  Member may be interested to know that, as  far

as residential flats are concerned, one has to be a

citizen  of Singapore in order to qualify, but  for

shops,  no question of citizenship arises. Citizens

or  non-citizens affected or not affected by  urban

renewal  can  tender  for Housing  and  Development

Board  flats. This will raise some difficulty.  The

main  question is whether or not these people  want

to  buy.  We  have, in fact, carried out  a  sample

survey to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



ascertain the wishes of these shopkeepers  and  the

majority  have  expressed no desire  to  buy.  They

prefer to carry on renting on the present terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rents, the Member was concerned mainly

about  shopkeepers affected by urban renewal. Those

affected   by  clearance  are  given  concessionary

rentals  based  on  the  average  tendered  rental,

starting  at  70  per cent of the average  tendered

rental  for  the first year, 80 per  cent  for  the

second  year, 90 per cent for the third  year,  and

only  in  the fourth year do they pay the full  one

hundred  per cent. In other words, they  are  given

not  only  priority  of  allocation,  but  also   a

concession  on rentals, provided they are  affected

by some Government clearance schemes. Of course, it

is  admitted  that  many of  the  cases  are  rent-controlled   premises  and  whatever  concessionary

rentals offered by the Government at present,  they

are  still  higher than the rents  they  previously

paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another method by which we are trying to

help  our shopkeepers if they can get together  in

sufficient  numbers to form a company  and  put  up

their  own  building. The Member will be interested

to know that the Government has already offered and

concluded  one  such transaction with  a  group  of

shopkeepers affected in Precinct South III, in  the

area  bounded by Upper Hokien Street, South  Bridge

Road, Upper Cross Street and New Bridge Road. These

shopkeepers have formed themselves into  a  company

jointly  to redevelop a site offered by Government.

Plans have already been submitted by this group for

the  site. This is one way to assist them where  we

can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is a second case. Government

is  also  working  out another  pilot  reallocation

programme,  and  this is in respect of  shopkeepers

affected  by resettlement around the area known  as

Precinct  North  III, bounded by  Victoria  Street,

Arab  Street,  North Bridge Road and Rochore  Road.

They are affected by urban renewal. We realise that

some shopkeepers have suffered as a result of being

evicted from rent-controlled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



premises   into   Housing  and  Development   Board

premises,  where  even though we  give  them  these

concessions,  they  have to tender  in  competition

with  others.  One way is to allow  them  to  build

their  own  premises and we are doing so.  We  have

concluded  a deal with one such group. There  is  a

second  project on hand and I hope  there  will  be

many more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I raise

a  point  in  relation to shophouses owned  by  the

Housing and Development Board? I came across a case

recently of one shopkeeper who has a licence to use

his  premises  as  a shoe-repairing  shop,  but  he

introduced,  as a side line inside the  premises  a

watch  repairing facility. He was hauled up by  the

Housing  and  Development Board official  concerned

and  was  told, "Look, you must not do this because

your  licence  does  not permit  it."  I  tried  to

intervene  and  said,  "Look,  why  cannot  you  be

flexible  about  the  whole  thing?"  The  official

replied, "Well, this has got to go through such and

such  a  committee and they will probably  turn  it

down. The best thing is to forget about it and tell

him  to  shut down the side line." Will the Housing

and  Development Board be more flexible in the  use

of shophouses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There are difficulties here, Sir,

because  when  the  shops are  tendered,  they  are

tendered for specific purposes, either coffee shops

or  some other business, and sometimes they change.

Provided  it is not a complete change, I think  the

Board  will  consider it. There is a  committee  to

consider applications of this nature, but it  would

be, in my view, a little oppressive on the part  of

the  Housing  and Development Board, if  a  man  is

having difficulties with his business and wants  to

start  a  side line, to say, "You cannot do  this."

The Board can strictly do so under the terms of the

tenancy  where they tie him up and say,  "You  will

only  use  the  shop  for repairing  watches."  The

moment  he  branches  into  something  else,   they

enforce the tenancy agreement and throw him out for

breach of some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



terms.  My  own  view is that  we  should  be  more

reasonable.  If  Members come across  tenants  who

want  to  change, I would suggest that  they  bring

this  to the attention of the Member for Anson  who

handles this matter on my behalf in the Ministry of

National Development. I am sure he will give  their

request every consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not quite

agree  with what the Minister has said just now  in

connection with the sale of shop premises belonging

to  the  Housing  and Development Board,  that  the

response  to  a survey which his officials  carried

out  was  not  very good. I do not know  when  they

carried out the survey. In my opinion, many renters

of shop premises are very interested in buying over

the  shop  premises because they can  pay  on  hire

purchase  terms, and after some time they  can  own

the  shop premises. This will reduce their  burden.

If the Minister is interested in giving it a trial,

I  suggest that he carry out another survey to  see

whether the response from the shop renters is good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> By "recently" I mean about a year

ago, if  conditions  have changed,  we  will  have

another  survey.  Of  course,  the  survey  is  not

extensive  throughout Singapore.  It  is  a  sample

survey.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the

Minister for his reply. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 to

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is only a token vote of $10 to be

given as a loan to the National Stadium Corporation

for   this  subhead.  I  would  like  to  ask   the

Parliamentary  Secretary whether the loan  provided

last year was enough so that in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



coming  year  there is no such need for  any  vote.

Perhaps  the  proceeds from Singapore Pools  (Pte.)

Ltd. are   sufficient  to  meet  the  expenditure

involved  in  the  building of a National  Stadium.

Could  the  Parliamentary Secretary  enlighten  the

House on this?



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the National Stadium will cost

about $18 million for the building and the complex.

On   completion,  the  stadium  will  be  able   to

accommodate  50,000 people. If  necessary,  we  can

expand   the   seating  capacity   in   future   to

accommodate  another 50,000 people. Work  began  in

December 1969 and the whole project is expected  to

be  completed by 1972. So far we have completed  52

per  cent  of the whole project. Recently  we  have

asked for tenders for the installation of lighting,

and  other  facilities. We have  so  far  spent  $4

million on the building itself, of which $1 million

is spent on piling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the $10 token vote, it is because the Toto

company,  Singapore Pools (Pte.) Ltd. has  already

provided $6 million for this project, and will give

more  in  future,  that  the  Government  does  not

require any additional vote for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Parliamentary Secretary for his reply,  and  I  beg

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sim Boon Woo.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for Loans to Industrial and

Commercial Enterprises for the next financial  year

has  been  increased  three-fold.  Apart  from  the

explanation in the Memorandum on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



Development Estimates of Singapore, I would like to

seek  further  clarification from the Minister  for

Finance  as  to  how this huge sum of  nearly  $200

million  will be utilised. The explanatory note  in

the  memorandum (para. 84 at page 12)  is  somewhat

unclear where it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A sum of $96.00 million will be provided for the

Development  Bank  of  Singapore.  In   1968,   the

Government  has  approved  two  lines   of   credit

totalling  $80.00  million;  however  in  May   and

December 1970, further lines of credit amounting to

$374.00 million were approved.'



<br><br>Among  other  enterprises, we have  Neptune  Orient

Lines  Ltd, and Jurong Shipbuilders and  the  rest

coming  within  the scope of this provision.  So  I

shall  be grateful if the Minister for Finance  can

explain  to  this House what lines  of  credit  are

involved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim Boon Woo? He is not here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  the  information  given   in   the

memorandum  is,  of course, merely a  summary.  The

sums  which  have been provided are in  respect  of

projects  which will be examined by the Development

Bank   of   Singapore.  The  position   about   the

Development  Bank  of Singapore is  that  sums  are

provided for the Bank, out of which they make loans

to private industry. The lines of credit which have

been mentioned in the memorandum have been provided

partly  for  loans to industrial organisations  and

partly  for real estate financing, and the  various

lines have different interest rates, depending upon

the  nature  of  financing. In the case  of  estate

financing,  the interest rate charged is different.

It  is  eight per cent as against other lines which

vary  from  five per cent for special  projects  to

seven  per cent. The drawings will depend upon  the

rate  at  which  the  loans  are  approved  by  the

Development    Bank   of   Singapore    and    when

disbursements  are  required, so  that  the  amount

which is provided here depends really on the amount

which  is  likely to be disbursed. For example,  in

1970-71 the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



amount which was disbursed by the Development  Bank

of Singapore was $61 million, so that, allowing for

the  increase  in activity which we expect  as  the

projects get larger in size and scope, we  think  a

provision of $96 million may be required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Neptune Orient Lines, the

provision  has  been  made  in  order  that   their

expansion programme can be carried out. Purchase of

the following vessels is contemplated in 197l-72:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) One combination carrier at a total cost of $1.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) One 8,000-deadweight-ton dry cargo ship for $6

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Two 12,000-ton cargo ships for $20 million.

These are second-hand ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Two 26,000-deadweight-ton tankers for $4

million.  This  is  merely a down-payment.  The

intention is that this would be a joint venture.

The  ships themselves would cost a total of $30

million each, and each party to the joint venture

would have to put up 7½ per cent as down-payment,

i.e., $4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) An 85,000-deadweight-ton tanker, again in a

joint venture. The ship will cost $20 million, and

the down-payment from the Singapore side will be $3

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Neptune Orient Lines will also purchase one

18,000-dead-weight-ton ship for $1.5 million down-payment, out of a total cost of $10.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) A further purchase is a super-tanker of

220,000   deadweight   tons,   costing    $100

million.  This is again a joint  venture,  and

the  down-payment from the Singapore side will

be 7.5 per cent or $7.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) A further purchase is a 35,000-deadweight-ton tanker for $20 million. This is a second-hand vessel.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Then a 150,000-ton ore/oil carrier at an

estimated cost of $75 million, of which the down-payment for Neptune Orient Lines' share in this

joint venture will be $2.8 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Two 3,000-deadweight-ton bulk carriers, for a

down-payment of $1.6 million. The total cost of the

ships will be $21 million.



<br><br>All this makes a total of $67.9 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jurong Shipbuilders, a loan of

$20,795,500 is required. The loan consists of  four

parts.  There  is  a loan for the  construction  of

shipyard facilities, $21.45 million. This is mainly

for  the purchase of materials for the construction

of  shipyard facilities. Of this sum, $14.3 million

will  come  from the Japanese grant of $25  million

for financing part of this loan, which is repayable

in  24  half-yearly equal instalments over a period

of  12  years at an interest rate of four per cent.

The interest rate will increase to 63 per cent from

1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan for the purchase of imported materials,

equipment and supplies for building vessels will be

$25  million. Out of this, $21.7 million will  come

from the Exim Bank of Japan, and the total loan  of

$25   million   is  repayable  in  20   half-yearly

instalments over a period of 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is a loan for the deferred portion of

the selling price of each vessel. This loan will be

given under a Development Bank of Singapore line of

credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A subsidy loan will also be given on the cash

deficit  of  the company. Of this amount,  I  think

$20.795 million will be required in 1971-72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further sum has been provided for Chartered

Industries  of Singapore Ltd. This is  a  total  of

$7.75 million.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One minute to go, Mr Hon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> As there is not much time, I

shall be very brief. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



Jurong Bird Park (Pte) Ltd. will require $1 million

for further development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Aquarama, which will be the marineland

type  of  development, will require $1 million  for

further expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Industries Enterprise Ltd., which is to

take  over the poultry vaccine production functions

of  the Primary Production Department, will require

$100,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Comfort Co-operative, $4 million is

provided for loans to purchase taxis and buses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Can I be permitted to raise a

small  point, Sir? I am just wondering whether  the

Minister  would  like to take  the  opportunity  to

inform the House what progress has been made by the

Development  Bank of Singapore in  its  efforts  to

salvage its investment in Eupoc.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Minister like to reply to

this query?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I would like to say that in

matters  of  detail where the Development  Bank  of

Singapore makes loans, I have no responsibility for

its operations. I, of course, have a responsibility

in view of the Government's investment in D.B.S. to

see  that it is a viable operation, and that it  is

not running into difficulties. Beyond that, I would

consider   that   any  details  concerning   D.B.S.

operations  are  not  really a  matter  for  me  to

answer.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have two

questions to ask in connection with the loans.  The

first is in regard to Neptune Orient Lines. I would

like  to  find  out from the Minister whether  this

shipping  line  is a going concern  right  now.  In

other  words, is it in the black? Is  it  making  a

profit or is it still making a loss?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, since the Government is providing

substantial loans to the Jurong Bird Park, will the

Minister be able to put pressure on the Jurong Bird

Park to lower its entry fees to enable the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



poorer  people to enter the Bird Park? It can  cost

quite  a  lot  of  money if we go  there  with  the

family.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I just wish

to  seek  further clarification on the point  which

the  Minister  has earlier made. Am  I  correct  in

assuming  that  if  I submit a  question  for  oral

answer on the same basis as I put it to him earlier

on, I will not get an answer in this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

said,  I  am  not  responsible for  the  day-to-day

operations  of  the Development Bank of  Singapore.

Therefore,  I  will  not  be  able  to  answer  the

question.  I  would suggest that these are  matters

which  the shareholders can place before the  Board

of  Directors at the annual general meeting of  the

Development Bank of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now answer the other question on Neptune

Orient  Lines. This is a question of accounting  -

how much depreciation is allowed for Neptune Orient

Lines,  that  is,  whether  the  ships  should   be

depreciated  over  a period of 15,  17,  20  or  25

years.  The accounts of a shipping line are  rather

complex,  but  very interesting.  In  the  case  of

shipping  lines  in the United Kingdom,  apparently

they  can  depreciate the ships to any extent  they

please, in  the case of Neptune Orient  Lines,  we

have  a choice of whether we should depreciate  the

ships  over 15, 17, 20 or 25 years. Therefore,  the

question whether or not we make a profit depends on

the amount of depreciation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> On commercial lines and

practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> As I have said, it varies very

considerably. Some shipping lines do  not  consider

depreciation necessary because the ships are  going

up in value all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the accounts of Neptune Orient Lines

are  concerned,  we  show a slight  loss.  That  is

because the depreciation, if I am correct,  is  for

17   years,   which   is  very  conservative.   The

depreciation  is  for either 15  or  17  years.  We

thought it better that we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



take  a  conservative  view  of  this  matter   and

depreciate the ships as rapidly as we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Jurong Bird Park, we have

appointed a company with a board of directors.  The

suggestion  for  lower fees can be put  before  the

board   of  directors,  who  of  course,   may   be

Government's nominees. However, they  have  also  a

duty  to  see that any company in which  they  have

been  appointed as directors should  operate  on  a

viable basis. I am happy to say that up to now, the

attendance  at the Jurong Bird Park has  been  very

good  and  we  should be able to cover  all  costs,

including  depreciation, if  we  continue  to  have

visitors at the same rate as we are having now.  At

this  particular stage the present fees  should  be

maintained because they seem to be popular  enough.

They  are apparently a going rate and satisfy  most

people,  because the attendance has not fallen  off

very  considerably. There are concession rates  for

school children. I would suggest a group concession

rate  for those people who would like to visit  the

Bird Park but who find the normal fees too high.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may be

permitted  to  seek  further elaboration  from  the

Minister  for Finance on the projects of  Chartered

Industries of Singapore Limited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Member's question is, what

exactly   is  Chartered  Industries  of   Singapore

Limited  doing?  I  think  the  evidence   of   its

activities  is  quite clear in  some  respects, in

other respects we would like to keep the production

confidential to some extent. I would only say  that

I  do  not think that there is any need for Members

to doubt the viability of this particular industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed

grateful  to the Minister for Finance for  assuring

this  House that the provisions are well taken care

of  and  that the viability of the loans  given  is

also assured. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 301.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (6) .



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to find out

from the Minister, first of all, up-to-date details

of  participation  in industry  by  Government  and

statutory boards, and information relating  to  the

failures   of  such  enterprises  engaged   in   by

Government and the statutory boards.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to know what are

Government's   plans,  if  any,   to   help   local

entrepreneurs   secure   the   technology,   better

management  and help in terms of marketing  abroad,

learning export techniques and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I have a suggestion, namely, that

perhaps  Government ought to consider  selling  off

Government-owned  enterprises  which  have   become

viable to private holders and then using the  money

as  a  catalyst  for further development  of  other

industries  which private capital is unable  to  go

into for want of perception of opportunities or for

want of capital and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Whampoa  is  asking for quite a lot of  information

and I do not think I shall be able to supply it  in

just 15 minutes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ten minutes, Mr Hon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Yes, 10 minutes. The Government

is   participating   in   roughly   30   industrial

enterprises.  I  did not quite get the  Member  for

Whampoa.  Did  he  mean industrial  enterprises  or

enterprises of every kind, because there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



are enterprises like the Singapore Telephone Board?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Commercial enterprises, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The division is not always very

apparent,   for  example,  whether  the   Singapore

Telephone Board and the Public Utilities Board  are

public utilities or industrial enterprises. In  the

United States, the Public Utilities Board would  be

regarded as an industrial enterprise. Assuming only

industrial enterprises, I think the Government  is

participating in some 30 enterprises and in  a  few

others  which  are  related to tourism,  e.g.,  the

Instant  Asia  Cultural Show (Private)  Limited  in

which we also participate in order to help tourism.

Thirty  enterprises  may be considered  industrial,

and  the total amount of Government equity involved

in  all  these  enterprises is  approximately  $121

million. The equity varies in amount from $2, where

we just form a company and two shares are issued to

the   two  subscribing  members,  to  roughly   $49

million.  In percentage terms, we have anything  up

to 100 per cent participation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of most of these industries has

so  far  been satisfactory. Some of them  are  very

satisfactory   and  there  are  others   which   we

designate "sick companies" and we keep a watch over

them.  There has been only one failure and  mention

has  been made about this in previous debates. This

is  a  failure as far as the project is  concerned,

but  it  was  not  a total loss  and  we  sold  the

Government share in the enterprise. This is related

to   a  bicycle  factory  which  is  no  longer  in

production  and  which has been converted  to  some

other   very  good  use  in  which  the   tool-room

facilities were a major reason for the entrepreneur

taking over the enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On plans to help local industries, I think we

have  various organisations of which the Member  is

already aware. The Economic Development Board,  for

example,   among  its  various  activities,   helps

potential  entrepreneurs to acquire  the  necessary

technology by way of joint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



ventures in collaboration with overseas firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Bank of Singapore is also

assisting  by giving loans and assisting in  equity

and finding local partners for overseas firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards assistance in management, the

Government   has  various  centres.  The   National

Productivity Centre is one which helps  in  various

management  fields. Of course,  the  Government  is

also  associated with the Institute  of  Management

and  the  Universities in their  efforts  to  teach

management   techniques. As   far   as   providing

management  techniques is concerned, we  have  also

the efforts of organisations like the International

Executive  Service  Corps and  the  United  Nations

Organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In helping industries with marketing, we have the

Exports Promotion Centre. There is also the  Export

Promotion  Advisory Committee.  There  is  INTRAXCO

(International Trading Company) which  does  actual

export  promotion work. And there are,  of  course,

Government  organisations like the  Trade  Division

and  our  overseas  embassies and high  commissions

which play advisory roles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers' associations and the Chambers of

Commerce also help in preparations for trade fairs.

I think the Member for Whampoa is familiar with the

"Jetro Fair" in Japan to which he will be leading a

mission in April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question the Member asked was whether we

should  not sell off some of the equity to  private

holders.  This is something which we will consider.

In  fact, in certain cases we have already done so.

For  example,  in the case of Jurong  Shipyard,  we

thought  that in order to bring in local  expertise

in  addition  to  what  we already  have  from  the

Japanese partner, we would sell some of the  equity

to  various local entrepreneurs who would also take

part  in the management or in the direction of  the

firm,  so that although we started off with 49  per

cent,  I  believe our percentage holding of  Jurong

Shipyard is now 40 per cent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cases where the companies have gone

public,  like  the National Iron and  Steel  Mills,

there  is  no reason why we cannot sell our  shares

very  readily. But in this instance the shares  are

already mostly in private hands. In other companies

like  Keppel Shipyard and Sembawang Shipyard, there

may  be some difficulties. For example, in the case

of  Sembawang Shipyard, we have undertaken  certain

obligations  in respect of repairs of  Commonwealth

naval vessels. But we will be prepared from time to

time to consider what shareholdings we can dispose

of.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I have just one small point

for clarification, Mr Speaker, Sir. As regards the

equity  participation mentioned  by  the  Minister,

does  this  relate to that owned by the  Government

alone,  or does it include the shares owned by  the

statutory authorities as well?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Se -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The statutory authorities in

most cases own only public utilities. The Singapore

Telephone  Board, for example, which is a statutory

authority, owns some shares in a telephone  company

to  manufacture telephone instruments.  As  regards

selling these shares to private holders, this is  a

matter really for the Singapore Telephone Board.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

his reply and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $363,655,520 for Head 91 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 101 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to

draw the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs

to  the need for a new divisional headquarters  for

Paya Lebar Police Station. I am, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



course,  happy  to  note there is  a  provision  of

$100,010 for the divisional headquarters at  Grange

Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some news about Paya Lebar Police

Station some time ago and I gather the Minister for

Home  Affairs is well aware of it. Perhaps it would

be  pertinent  for me to inform the  House  of  the

facilities at this police station. They are grossly

inadequate   to  meet  the  needs  of   the   eight

constituencies which come under Paya  Lebar  Police

Station, which is in "F" Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder whether the Minister for Home

Affairs  is aware that some former police  barracks

have now been converted into offices. I believe the

total   population  of  the  eight  constituencies,

including Serangoon Gardens which is represented by

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Home Affairs, is quite large. I believe there is  a

shortage  of manpower at Paya Lebar Police Station.

Very often petty thefts and robberies are committed

along roads like Punggol Road and Tampines Road. It

is  the shortage of manpower and lack of facilities

at Paya Lebar Police Station that brings about such

problems.  In this respect, I shall be grateful  if

the  Minister for Home Affairs can indicate to this

House whether there are plans for the expansion  of

Paya  Lebar  Police Station, or whether  there  are

plans  for  the  construction of a  new  divisional

police headquarters to be sited in any of the eight

constituencies. I do not say that it should  be  in

Punggol, but I did ask a question previously  about

the setting up of a police post in Punggol, and  it

was  agreed to by the Minister of State of  Defence

when the Police was under the Ministry of Defence.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Police comes under the portfolio of

the  Minister for Home Affairs, I shall be grateful

if  the  Minister  can indicate whether  or  not  a

police  post will be set up in Punggol.  Or  is  it

because  there  has been a change of  Ministry  and

Minister that the idea has also been changed?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am fully aware of the

conditions of Paya Lebar Police Station.  In  fact,

when  I  assumed office, this was one of the  first

police  stations I personally visited. One  of  the

first  things  I  did when I was in  the  Ministry,

after my visit to this police station, was to  look

into the question of renovating it. It has come  to

light that the cost of renovation is quite high. At

the  moment, I think it would be far better to look

into  the  need  of  having a new  police  station,

properly  sited, to take care of the  fairly  large

area    covered    by   this   divisional    police

headquarters. I believe it requires,  at  the  very

least,  $150,000 just to renovate the place.  If  a

new police station is to be built, the cost can  be

anything  from $150,000 to half a million  dollars.

So it is far better to have a new police station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware that some barracks have been

converted  into offices, and I myself have  visited

these offices. I think they are inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of manpower is one of the problems

the  Ministry  is  taking very seriously.  We  have

considered the pros and cons of whether to continue

with the present system of police patrol, which  is

highly labour intensive, or whether to adopt a more

modern  method  of police patrol, which  cuts  down

manpower   but  uses  a  high  degree   of   police

technology in the form of more vehicles and  better

radio  equipment. As I have publicly stated earlier

this year, we are going to equip two divisions this

year,  and  try out whether this is more economical

and,   from  the  long-term  point  of  view,  more

effective.  I  will  go down to Paya  Lebar  Police

Station  again some time this year,  and  view  the

whole  area  in  relation to  this  new  system  of

policing. This time, for some very good reasons,  I

will  bring  along with me all the  M.P.s  who  are

involved in that area. I am not quite sure a police

post  is the answer to the problem, for the  simple

reason  that with this new method of policing,  the

police force will have greater mobility. There will

also  be greater frequency of patrols. I have  been

to another rural area, that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



the  Rural West Division, where there is  a  police

post  and  we put a man there. There is  no  crime.

From  the  point  of  view of  the  public,  it  is

convenient, but it is not a very efficient  way  of

using   manpower.  Although  my  predecessor,   the

Minister of Defence, agreed to set up a police post

in  Punggol, I am not aware of it. I do not believe

that  provision  has been made for  such  a  police

post.  I  will  certainly look into  the  question,

bearing   in  mind  the  larger  problem  of   more

efficient use of police manpower.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Before I withdraw my amendment,

can  the Minister for Home Affairs indicate in  the

affirmative   that   a   new   divisional    police

headquarters will come about to serve "F" Division,

which  covers the constituencies of Sembawang,  Nee

Soon,   Jalan   Kayu,  Serangoon   Gardens,   Upper

Serangoon, Punggol, Paya Lebar and certain parts of

Tampines?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can

certainly assure the Member that "F" Division has a

high  degree  of priority, but in relation  to  the

competing  needs  of the other police  stations,  I

cannot  give an affirmative answer. At the  moment,

we  are  trying to work out a rational formula  for

the  sizes of the police divisions. How many police

divisions  are  we going to need in  future?  Until

that  question is clearly settled, I cannot give  a

definite  answer. If I were rash enough to  promise

the  Member for Punggol, I would not be honest with

him  or with myself, because this is a very complex

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On that note, Sir, I thank the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs and  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,419,810 for Head 101 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining heads of expenditure

in respect of which no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



amendment stands on the Order Paper Supplement are

Heads 76, 77, 92 and 141. I propose to take those

heads of expenditure en bloc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sums stated for those heads

of  expenditure which appear in the last column  of

the Summary of Estimated Expenditure on pages 5 and

6  of  Paper  Cmd.  4  of 1971 stand  part  of  the

Development  Estimates for the financial  year  1st

April,  1971, to 31st March, 1972," put, and agreed

to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the sum of $635,962,210 shall be

supplied  to  the  Government under  the  heads  of

expenditure  for the public services shown  in  the

Development  Estimates for the financial  year  1st

April,  1971,  to  31st March, 1972,  contained  in

Paper Cmd. 4 of 1971," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution to be reported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report that the Committee of Supply has come to a

certain resolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution reported -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $635,962,210 shall be supplied

<div align="center"><b>SWIMMING POOL IN RURAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL DISTRICT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs  if  his  Ministry has any  plans  for  the

construction  of  a swimming pool  in  a  centrally

located   area  for  the  use  of  school  children

studying  in the Rural Central District  comprising

Sembawang. Nee Soon, Thomson, Jalan Kayu, Serangoon

Gardens,  Paya Lebar, Upper Serangoon  and  Punggol

areas,   and,  if  so,  when  the  pool   will   be

constructed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> The reply to your question

above is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the concern of the Member on the

lack  of  swimming pools in the outlying  areas  in

general and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



especially   in   the   rural  central   districts,

comprising the areas mentioned by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, swimming pools and recreational

facilities  are  expensive propositions  and  there

must  be  a  proven demand and full utilisation  of

them to justify construction of new facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the takeover of sports facilities,

including swimming pools from the British  Services

on  their  withdrawal and until such time as  their

future usage can be determined, it is not desirable

to  consider  provision of new swimming  pools  and

recreational areas. It is, however, hoped that some

of the pools at Changi, and the Naval Base could be

made  available  for public use,  including  school

children in the rural districts.
