<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION (APEC) MEETING IN AUCKLAND</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Update)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Prime Minister (a)

whether  he  will give an update on the recent  Asia  Pacific

Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Auckland, New Zealand,

and in particular elaborate on the idea of signing Free Trade

Agreements (FTAs) with other countries, and (b) how such FTAs

would impact the trade agreements within ASEAN.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon

Yeo)  (for  the  Prime  Minister):   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  from

Singapore's  perspective, the outcome of  the  Auckland  APEC

meeting  was  positive.   There was strong  support  for  the

launch  of  a  New Round of multilateral trade  negotiations,

which would help lower market access barriers for Singapore's

goods  and  services.  There was also agreement on the  scope

and   modalities  of  such  negotiations.  These  are  strong

messages  which would give significant impetus to efforts  to

launch  a  New Round at the Third WTO Ministerial  Conference

later  this  year at Seattle, as APEC economies  account  for

more than half the global trade.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand has ably and skilfully chaired APEC this

year towards these strong outcomes.  It has managed well  the

bilateral and sub-regional side issues that had threatened to

overshadow the APEC meetings.  The general consensus is  that

New  Zealand has put APEC back on track, and restored a  good

measure of the grouping's relevance and credibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fringes of the Auckland APEC meetings, Singapore

announced that we would be entering into Free Trade Agreement

(FTA)  negotiations  with New Zealand.  We  also  reached  an

agreement  with  Mexico  to  explore  the  possibility  of  a

bilateral FTA, and with Chile and New Zealand for a study  on

a 3-party FTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put these FTA initiatives in perspective. While

we  pursue FTAs with strategic partners, our primary emphasis

is  still the multilateral trading system represented by  the

WTO.   The WTO is the only institution that can ensure a fair

and  predictable  environment  for  global  trade.   This  is

particularly important for a small country heavily  dependent

on  trade like Singapore.  We would be much poorer off  in  a

world where trade is not governed by international rules  and

dominated instead by individual economies or regional blocs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of our FTA with New Zealand and others is

to  use  them  as catalysts to accelerate the pace  of  trade

liberalisation within APEC.  In 1994, APEC Leaders  at  Bogor

made  a  commitment  to  achieve  free  and  open  trade  and

investment  by 2010 for developed economies and by  2020  for

developing  economies.  We think that one way  to  fast-track

the achievement of the Bogor vision is through sub-APEC FTAs.

APEC economies which are ready to embrace the Bogor goals  of

free  trade  earlier should be encouraged to form FTAs  among

themselves.   Our FTA with New Zealand will  be  grounded  on

Bogor  goals  and  will  be open to  participation  by  other

economies.  In this way, we see the Singapore-New Zealand FTA

as  being a stepping stone towards an eventual APEC-wide FTA,

thus realising the Bogor vision.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Auckland, we were pleasantly surprised to note that

several  other APEC leaders shared a similar view.  They  are

discussing  FTAs  among themselves, for  example,  Korea  and

Chile, Japan and Mexico.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore remains committed to ASEAN and the

establishment of a strong ASEAN Free Trade Area  (AFTA)  that

is  attractive  to  investors.  This is in our  own  interest

because  our  long-term  fortunes are  inextricably  tied  to

ASEAN.   Our  FTA  initiatives  will  not  detract  from  our

commitments  and obligations in ASEAN.  We will  continue  to

work  hard for the implementation of the AFTA Agreement,  the

ASEAN  Agreement on Services, the ASEAN Investment  Area  and

other ASEAN economic initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decision to enter into FTAs with other trading

partners  can  help  to strengthen the region.   We  see  the

Singapore-New Zealand FTA as a preliminary step to  build  up

linkages  between ASEAN and other regions, for  example,  the

Closer Economic Relations (CER) grouping of Australia and New

Zealand.   At a recent ASEAN meeting with Australia  and  New

Zealand,  the  Ministers  agreed  to  set  up  a  high  level

taskforce  to  study the feasibility of establishing  an  FTA

between  ASEAN  and  the CER by the  year  2010.   This  will

strengthen ASEAN's negotiating position in the global trading

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to ask the Minister whether the Government  has

plans to also extend these FTAs with other countries, besides

New Zealand, Mexico and Chile.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We have had preliminary

discussions  with the United States, Australia,  New  Zealand

and  Chile  on  the  possibility  of  a  P5  arrangement   to

liberalise  trade  among  ourselves.   And  with  some  other

countries, we have also initiated preliminary discussions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, may I

ask  the  Minister,  given the trade  increases  within  Asia

itself, would the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>

consider  prioritising a Free Trade Agreement with  Japan  or

other East Asian economies?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Our offer is to all those who

are ready to move along with us. We have little difficulty in

establishing  FTAs with other countries. So  those  countries

that  are  prepared  to  move earlier than  others,  we  will

welcome   them  to  join  us.  For  this  reason,   our   FTA

negotiations  with  New  Zealand are  based  upon  open-ended

membership.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, how far

would the FTA between New Zealand and Singapore go?  Will  it

also   include  travel  between  the  citizens  of  the   two

countries?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> There is already free travel

between  the peoples of the two countries. I do not think  we

require visas to visit each other.  I wonder whether this  is

the  question  which  Mr  Chiam is posing  to  me  or  he  is

referring to something else.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Free travel, like in Europe between

the countries which have a free trade area.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I do not think that we will

agree  on the free migration of people without control, which

is possible in Europe now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister whether, in view of the fact that there  is  an

economic crisis, there will be a delay in achieving the Bogor

time limit of 2010/2020 for the liberalisation of tariffs.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two weeks

ago,  I  chaired the ASEAN meeting in Singapore.  Before  the

meeting, I did not have very high expectations because we are

just  coming  out of the economic crisis and I  thought  that

many other member countries would rather concentrate on their

own  domestic  problems  first  before  looking  at  regional

issues.   But  to  my pleasant surprise, the  mood  was  very

positive and there was strong determination to carry forward

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>

with initiatives like the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the ASEAN

Investment Area, and which was why it was possible for us  to

talk  about  something which we had not talked about  before,

which  was  the  possibility of establishing an  FTA  between

ASEAN and the CER.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

whether there is a possibility of a Free Trade Agreement with

China.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, China of course

represents the greatest Free Trade Area in the world with 1.2

billion people.  I do not think it is in China's interest for

the  time  being to enter into an FTA with us.   It  will  of

course be in our interest to enter into an FTA with China. As

I  said  earlier, our offer is to everyone in APEC  and  that

includes China.

<div align="center"><b>STAMP DUTY ON PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Finance,

having brought forward the payment due date of the stamp duty

on property transactions as part of the package to deter real-estate  speculation, (a) how many of these transactions  have

failed  to  complete after the stamp duty has been paid;  (b)

whether  it  is equitable for a purchaser to bear  the  stamp

duty    of   an   incomplete   transaction   resulting   from

circumstances beyond his reasonable control and (c) will  the

Government  review the procedure to minimize this unnecessary

burden on such a purchaser.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, there is no requirement for failed transactions

to  be  reported  to  IRAS.   IRAS therefore  does  not  have

information on the number of failed transactions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stamp Duties Act was recently amended to allow

refund in the following circumstances:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the vendor is unable to prove his title to the

property;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a purchaser, being a foreign person, is unable to

obtain  approval under the Residential Property Act  (Chapter

274) to acquire or purchase the property;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the property is acquired or is proposed for

acquisition   by  any  public  authority  pursuant   to   the

provisions  of any written law authorising or empowering  the

public authority to acquire land compulsorily;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the purchase of the property is conditional upon

permission by the competent authority to develop or subdivide

the property and such permission is refused;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) either vendor or purchaser fails to obtain the

approval of any public authority to sell or purchase, as  the

case may be, the property;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) the Commissioner of Building Control makes an order

under  section 24 of the Building Control Act in  respect  of

the property, ie, the building is unfit for occupation; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) a Strata Titles Board refuses an application

for the sale of the property under section 84A, 84D or 84E of

the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Chapter 158), ie, rejection  of

an application for en-bloc sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the purchaser aborts the transaction, then the stamp

duty  is part of the cost for aborting the transaction.  This

is  the intent of bringing forward the payment of the date of

the  stamp  duty. If the seller aborts the transaction,  then

the  purchaser  should  take  legal  action  to  enforce  the

contract.  Nevertheless, stamp duty has been waived on a case

by  case  basis  where the purchaser has been able  to  offer

satisfactory evidence that the transaction was aborted due to

circumstances  beyond his control and was not  a  speculative

venture.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the Minister whether it would be more logical to  revert

to  the  original system of collecting stamp duty,  in  other

words,  at  the completion of the transaction.  Some  of  the

letters and responses that I have received from IRAS

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>

to my constituents state that stamp duty is a processing fee.

As  such, regardless of whether a transaction is completed or

not, it is collectable.  If the fee is such a big amount  and

dependent on the value of the transaction, surely it  is  not

processing fee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, if the Member can remember, we

brought  forward the payment of the stamp duty  in  1996,  as

part  of  the anti-speculation measures.  That was the  whole

idea  -   to bring forward the payment of the stamp  duty  so

that  only bona fide purchasers, who have real intent to  buy

property,  will go into a transaction and they pay the  cost.

This is to deter speculation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when stamp duty was paid at the end of the

transaction, it did not cost very much for somebody  to  take

out  an  option, speculate on a property, and if  the  market

takes a downturn, abort the transaction.  So this measure  of

bringing  it  forward  is  part  and  parcel  of  the   anti-speculation package in 1996.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

whether  the  Government had thought through the consequences

of  bringing forward the payment of the stamp duty.   Because

in  the  past, the fee was only paid upon completion  of  the

transaction.  Based on the reason that he outlined, for  bona

fide  buyers who cannot complete the transaction for whatever

reason,  they are still obligated to pay the stamp duty,  and

that  is  surely  not  the  intent  of  the  anti-speculation

measures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I have already explained the

reason for bringing forward the payment.  Yes, of course, the

Government  thought through the whole issue before announcing

the package in 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the transaction did not go through because of

circumstances  beyond  the purchaser's  control,  as  I  have

explained  earlier of the seven circumstances, due to  reason

of the purchaser not being able to get the necessary approval

to  complete  the transaction, then the stamp  duty  will  be

refunded.  If the transaction fails to go through because the

seller aborts the transaction, then the purchaser is entirely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>

within  his rights to enforce the contract.  If the purchaser

himself aborts the transaction, then it is part and parcel of

the  cost.   He  knows, before he enters into a  transaction,

that  if he fails to go through with the transaction  and  he

aborts  the transaction, then this is part and parcel of  the

cost involved in aborting the transaction.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, if I come across cases where the

transaction  cannot  be  completed because  of  circumstances

beyond the control of the buyer, can I bring the cases to him

for favourable review, and have the stamp duty refunded?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have mentioned, we do consider

this on a case-by-case basis.  But we need very good evidence

that  the  transaction is aborted beyond the control  of  the

purchaser.   If  the  purchaser aborts the  transaction,  you

cannot  say  that  that  is beyond his  control,  because  he

himself  aborted the transaction.  So he must pay  the  stamp

duty.

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE CONDOMINIUMS AND HDB FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increase in sale prices and impact on affordability)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether the average compounded increase  in  (a)

private  condominium,  (b) HDB direct purchase  and  (c)  HDB

resale prices over the last (i) 5 years and (ii) 10 years has

outstripped the increase in wages over the same periods,  and

if  so,  whether  the  resultant impact on  affordability  is

addressed by the planned land sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John

Chen  Seow Phun) (for the Minister for National Development):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  as  at the second quarter  of  1999,  the

increase in monthly wages of workers compared with the  price

increase for the various categories of housing types over the

last 5 and 10 years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>

are  in  the table (Cols. 397-398) which I shall now ask  the

Clerk  of Parliament to circulate to Members.  My staff  told

me that they have given the table to Parliament.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1999/19991013/19991013-HA-0710397.htm">Table - Trends of Wages vs Property Prices (Cols. 397-398)</a><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue while we get the table.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as shown in the table, the

price  increase of new HDB flats is generally  in  line  with

wage  increases over the same periods.  This is  because  HDB

takes  into account wage increases when adjusting  prices  of

new  flats.  In this way, the Government ensures that new HDB

flats remain affordable to the majority of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of the table, maybe I will just go

through the table which is very simple.  Let me say that  the

monthly  wage increase over the last five years is  about  6%

per  annum.  If it is over the last 10 years, it is about  7%

per  annum.   Whereas for new HDB flat prices,  the  increase

over the last 5 years is about 5% per annum, as opposed to 6%

for the increase in monthly wages.  And the increase over the

last  10  years is 7% per annum, as opposed to 7%  per  annum

increase for the monthly wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For resale HDB flat prices, the increase over the last 5

years  is  7%  per annum, and the increase over the  last  10

years is 12% per annum.  For private condominium prices,  the

increase  over  the  last 5 years is 0% per  annum,  and  the

increase over the last 10 years is 9% per annum.  Sir,  as  I

have  said earlier, the Government ensures that new HDB flats

remain affordable to the majority of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, prices of resale HDB flats are

determined  by market forces.  Resale flats cater  mainly  to

HDB  upgraders who have the benefit of capital gains from the

sale  of their previous HDB flats.  First-timers who wish  to

purchase  resale  flats can apply for the CPF  Housing  Grant

Scheme.   The  grant, which is as much as $40,000  for  those

applying to live near their parents, can be used to  pay  for

the downpayment of the resale

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>

flats.   In  this  way, the Government helps to  enhance  the

affordability of resale flats for first-timers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for private condominiums, current prices are at the

same level as 5 years ago. Over the last 10 years, as I said,

condominium  prices  have increased at about  9%  per  annum,

which is slightly higher than the corresponding wage increase

of 7% per annum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prices and affordability of private residential

properties  are determined by the market.  Government  cannot

set prices for private property, like new HDB flats. However,

Government can and will ensure that there is sufficient  land

set aside for private housing to meet the medium term demand.

This  is  done under the regular Government land sales  (GLS)

programme.   The Government will also ensure regular  release

of  comprehensive  and accurate information  on  the  private

property market to enable buyers and sellers to make informed

decisions.  In this way, the Government can contribute  to  a

stable  property market, where prices generally move in  line

with prevailing economic conditions.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I have two

supplementary questions for the Minister of State.   Firstly,

what  would the Minister of State consider to be entry  level

housing,  and whether the increase in the selling  prices  of

such  housing  has actually kept pace with  the  increase  in

wages for the relevant segment of the population?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, given the faster increase in prices of resale

flats,  whether  the  revision  of  the  income  ceiling  for

eligibility for direct purchase from HDB has taken this  into

account, and whether these have been made in tandem with  the

wage  increase  for  first-timers; specifically,  whether  at

least  the  same percentage of people is eligible  with  each

revision of the income ceiling?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, for entry level, if you

look at the 4-room flats and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>

with  the average income household of, say, $2,700, it  would

usually take about 4-5 years for the couple to be able to pay

the  20% downpayment for the flat, and thereafter paying only

about 17% of their household income for the monthly mortgage,

and   that   17%  can  be  paid  fully  through   their   CPF

contributions.   Therefore, we can say that  it  is  actually

very affordable.  The entry level is actually quite low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the ceiling, we have revised the ceiling over the

years.  Let me give the Member some indication of the ceiling

revision.   In 1989, it was about $5,000 for 3-,  4-,  5-room

and  Executive flats.  For an extended family, it was $8,000,

ie,  3-tier family which includes the grandparents.  In 1991,

we  revised it to $6,000; in 1992, $7,000; 1994, $8,000.   In

1995,  with  the  introduction of the Executive  Condominiums

(EC), we raised it to $10,000, for applicants to qualify  for

EC.   In  1996,  we  had the anti-speculation  measures,  and

followed  by the economic crisis.  So, since then, there  was

no revision for the ceiling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give the Member some statistics to put the

issue  in  perspective.  If you look at applicants who  apply

for 4-room and 5-room flats, which is in the range of $7,000-$8,000, it is less than 1% of the applicants who apply for 4-and  5-room flats and who are in the monthly income range  of

$7,000-$8,000.   It  shows  that  the  large   majority   are

basically up to $5,000 monthly income, which means  that  the

income  ceiling  is  pretty generous.  In fact,  the  $10,000

income  ceiling  covers  92%  of  the  Singaporean  household

income.  I would say that if you look at the long-term target

of  the  proportion  of Singaporeans who own  public  housing

versus  private housing, it is 75% versus 25%.  So,  I  would

say that at this income ceiling, it is really very generous.

<div align="center"><b>KIDNAPPING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Publicity on laws and punishment)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a)

whether  the team that handled the recent case of  kidnapping

has been highly commended, and (b) whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>

there  are  plans to publicise widely our laws and punishment

concerning  kidnapping,  especially  to  foreigners  in   the

country.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the team that handled the recent case of kidnapping  did

a  good  job  in  solving the case quickly and arresting  the

kidnappers.   They  also recovered the  bulk  of  the  ransom

money.   The victim was also released unharmed.   As  in  all

such   cases,   officers  who  excel  will  be  appropriately

recognised by the Police and my Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent kidnapping case attracted extensive

media coverage for about a week.  During this time, the press

repeatedly  publicised that the serious offence of kidnapping

attracts  the  death penalty.  There will be  more  publicity

when  the  case goes to Court.  I am sure that the swift  and

resolute  action  of CID is additional strong  deterrence  to

would-be kidnappers.  Foreigners are also warned of the tough

laws in Singapore when they come to our country to work.

<div align="center"><b>BICYCLISTS TRAVELLING ALONG PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Regulations)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs (a) whether there are regulations for bicyclists when

travelling along public thoroughfares to ensure the safety of

themselves and other road-users; and (b) if there  are,  what

is  the  number  of bicyclists caught for violation  of  such

regulations  for  the past year as well  as  the  punishments

meted out for such violations.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home</b>

<b>Affairs):</b> Sir, cyclists on roads are required to obey the

same  traffic  rules  as motorists.  Additionally,  the  Road

Traffic  (Bicycle) Rules set out the manner in which cyclists

should  conduct  themselves whilst on the  road.   They  also

stipulate  safety requirements such as brakes and  headlamps.

The purpose is to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>

ensure  the  safety  of the cyclists as well  as  other  road

users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, Traffic Police issued 115 summonses to

cyclists.   These  were  for more serious  offences  such  as

riding  against  the flow of traffic and  riding  abreast  of

other  cyclists.   A  typical composition  fine  of  $20  was

imposed.   Cyclists  who commit minor  offences  are  usually

counselled and let off with a warning.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, is the Minister

of  State  aware that there are many bicycles being  used  at

night on the road without headlamps or reflector lights?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think it is a subjective

view,  but  there will certainly be bicyclists who flout  the

law.   I  want  to  assure the Member that what  the  Traffic

Police  will do is to step up public education.  This is  one

focus  where Traffic Police will put more effort, targetting,

in  particular,  the elderly, working through,  for  example,

SAGE  and the People's Association as well as foreign workers

through their employers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I do not believe it is a

matter  of subjective view.  Would the Minister of State  ask

some  company  to  do  a survey because,  currently,  without

registration,  most bicycles are used on  the  roads  without

headlights or reflector lights at night.  And very often, for

some  strange  reasons,  the bicyclists  normally  wear  dark

clothings, making them both a danger to themselves as well as

to  other  road  users.   Just for the  Minister  of  State's

information,  I  had  a personal experience  where  I  nearly

knocked  into a bicyclist.  Thereafter, I made it a point  to

observe  such bicyclists on the roads.  From my own  personal

survey,  I  would say that the majority of them  do  not  use

headlights.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I have assured the Member,

we  have got the rules which are there.  Indeed, all cyclists

should be reminded that they are also part of the traffic and

therefore  they  should abide by the traffic  rules.   Having

said this, whilst enforcement is important, on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>

other  hand, given the wide range of cyclists where you  have

young children and the elderly, we should also remember  that

public  education is another arm that should be embarked  on.

Indeed,  police will take these two approaches of enforcement

and public education.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> May I ask of the Minister of State

whether  the  police will step up enforcement because  I  had

personally   observed   policemen  actually   ignoring   such

infringements?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> It depends on the nature of

the offence.  Like I have said, in the more serious offences,

for  example,  cycling against the flow  of  traffic,  police

indeed  have issued such summonses.  Indeed, over the  years,

the  number  of  summonses has gone up.  I  will  inform  the

police  of  the  Member's  concern  and,  where  appropriate,

enforcement would be carried out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> May I ask something specifically

of  the  Minister?   If  a  bicycle is  used  on  the  public

thoroughfare without a headlight, and if a policeman  happens

to  be  standing  by,  would  the policeman  ignore  such  an

offence,  or would he try to stop the cyclist and  take  down

the particulars of the cyclist?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Like I have said, there is a

range  of  options  open  to the  police  officer.   In  some

situations,  they  have  given warnings,  which  is  also  an

option.   In other cases, they have issued summonses.   So  I

would say it depends on the facts of each case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> I am afraid the Minister of State

misunderstood me.  I have asked a very specific question, ie,

if  a  policeman  were  to  observe  a  bicyclist  without  a

headlight  passing  by  him at night,  would  he  ignore  the

infringement?   Or  would  the policeman  actually  stop  the

cyclist to take down the particulars of the cyclist?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As a law enforcement officer,

I would expect the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>

policeman to at least warn the cyclist and to inform him that

he is violating the law.  That is the least that he can do.

<div align="center"><b>AUTISTIC CENTRE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development  if his Ministry has plans to set up an  autistic

centre  to  cater  to the needs of autistic persons  who  are

above 12 years old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Community  Development  (Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon)  (for   the

Minister   for  Community  Development):  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,

presently,  there are several voluntary welfare organisations

(VWOs)  that provide services for autistic persons above  the

age  of  12.   Autism occurs in varying degrees of  severity.

With  the  appropriate  training, the  majority  of  autistic

persons can remain in the community.  The National Council of

Social   Service   (NCSS)   and  the   Autistic   Association

(Singapore) in a joint effort started the Autism Youth Centre

(AYC)  in March this year.  The AYC provides autistic  youths

aged between 12 and 21 years with social and learning skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AYC has just been allocated new premises at an HDB

void deck at Hougang Avenue 6, and will move there as soon as

renovations are completed.  This location will enable AYC  to

reach out to more autistic persons and help them to integrate

better with the mainstream community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another VWO effort is the Christian Outreach to the

Handicapped's  day  activity  centre  which  trains  autistic

youths  aged  between 13 and 18 years in  independent  living

skills  (such as taking a bath, making simple meals, sweeping

the  floor,  making  their own beds and  clearing  their  own

things).   The very low-functioning autistic persons  without

family  support and who need residential care can be admitted

into  the seven homes for disabled persons run by VWOs.   Two

more homes are in the pipeline.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD will continue to work with the NCSS and VWOs to

ensure  that  there are adequate services and  facilities  to

meet the needs of the disabled, including the autistic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Some

autistic  persons need to be looked after in the  homes.   At

the  moment, there is no such home.  If they are sent to  the

homes for the disabled and handicapped, will such homes  have

adequate facilities and expertise to look after the needs  of

such autistic patients?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, at

present  there  is  a day activity centre in  Clementi  which

takes  in  autistic  children and  the  Government  has  also

allotted a HDB void deck in Hougang Avenue 6 to build  a  new

day  activity centre.  When completed, the new home can  take

in  all  the  30-over autistic children on the waiting  list.

There  are seven homes for the disabled which take  in  those

who need residential care.  MCD will try its best to help the

family  and the community to better look after these autistic

children  and endeavour to allow them to lead a normal  life.

Sending them to the homes should be the last resort.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask whether we

know the number of such children in Singapore and whether  we

have done any study to ascertain the future trends and how do

we cope with it?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> At present, in the schools

system,  we have about 200-300 such students and  we  try  to

encourage  them to integrate into the mainstream.  Those  who

really  cannot  do  so,  we will send  them  to  the  special

schools.   Based  on the UK experience, it is estimated  that

for every 500 persons there will be one autistic person.   So

if  we  have three million people, there would be about 7,000

autistic people.  Based on the United States' experience, for

every  200  persons you have one autistic  person,  but  this

would depend on the degree of autism.  At the moment, quite a

number of VWOs are very actively working with MCD and MOE  to

try and develop programmes to support the children as well as

they are trying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>

to  integrate the children into the mainstream.   We  try  to

let  them  learn some skills so that when they  grow  up,  at

least  they  can be employable.  Those who really  cannot  be

employable,  they  can go to the shelter  workshop.   At  the

moment,  we have quite a number of shelter workshops.   Those

who  cannot enter the shelter workshop can go to the 11  day-care  activity  centres which will help them  to  learn  some

living skills.  We will try to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that as society progresses, people will

expect  the  Government to do more.   Our  approach  is  that

through the many-helping-hands, the family, the community and

NCSS, we hope to develop more for our children.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I seek a clarification? Autism is a

difficult condition.  Does the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

think  that  we  should  leave all  this  to  the  grassroots

organisations  or  does  she think  we  should  rope  in  the

Ministry of Health so that we can get their experts from  the

medical doctors to help these children?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said just

now  that  MCD  actually  believes in the  many-helping-hands

approach.  For infants, we need the MOH to come in.  For  the

school-going children, we need the MOE to come in.   For  the

others, we need the community and the society to come and try

to integrate them into the mainstream society.

<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Third Allotted Day)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [11th

October, 1999],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the

President be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our thanks to the President for the Speech which  he

delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening  of  the

Second Session of this Parliament.".  -  [Mr Davinder Singh].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Minister of State without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State without Portfolio (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion

standing in the name of Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address and the Addenda that

accompanied the Address placed a sharp focus on people.   The

unions and the union leaders are particularly happy with  the

sections  on people development, on education of  the  young,

and  on life-long learning.  For people development must mean

for  the  workers development of workers.  Education  of  the

young  must  mean helping future generations of  workers  fit

into  the  future economy.   The call for life-long  learning

and the provision of infrastructure and support for life-long

learning must also mean that workers will be helped to remain

employable, competitive and effective in the future  economy.

So  the Government's initiatives help and prepare our workers

for the knowledge-based economy that we are entering into  in

the next millennium.  So our unions welcome and fully support

the initiatives outlined in the President's Address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr Lee Boon Yang, the Minister for Manpower,

elaborated  on some of the schemes that are being offered  to

the workers.  I am sure the unions are particularly reassured

by his message that the Government will continue to invest in

people  and  plan for the future.  He shared  with  us  three

trends  that workers in Singapore will face and be challenged

by.   The unions do recognise these trends and also share the

same  concerns.  The unions will help our workers to overcome

the  challenges.  Indeed, it is like us facing a wave of  the

beaches  of Hawaii or Miami.  And if we are not prepared  for

the big wave, we will be thrown off or even drown.  But if we

have  a  surfboard  and if we have learnt  how  to  surf  and

balance on that surfboard, then when the next big wave comes,

we  can  ride  that  wave smoothly and quickly  to  shallower

waters  and, hopefully, reach the beach.  So the unions  hope

that  the Government and employers will help our workers ride

the waves as they come.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also mentioned that we ought to review the

retrenchment benefits.  When this subject was brought up  not

long ago, the unions came together for a quick discussion  on

what  this meant for workers.  I would like to take a bit  of

time  to  reflect what the grassroots leaders in  the  unions

feel about this subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, retrenchment benefits are capped at 25 years

of  service.  This was discussed only in 1997 and implemented

only  on  1st January 1999.  This is a new cap.  Before  this

there was no cap.  So this new structure is in place only for

less  than a year.  And the union leaders feel that it  is  a

bit  too early to talk about a review when the new system has

not worked for very long.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have observed that in the last two years when

retrenchments  took place, workers who were  retrenched  took

longer to find a new job.  Retrenchment benefits are to  help

them  tide  over the period of unemployment.  In good  times,

workers  perhaps will be able to find new jobs very  quickly.

But  if  we  enter  into a new prolonged recession,  and  the

question is not "if" but "when" we do so - we lower the caps,

would the new retrenchment benefits quantum be sufficient  to

help  our  workers  pay  for  their  household  expenses  and

expenses incurred in looking for a new job?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in the last two years, older workers who were

retrenched found new jobs at lower pay.  And they  will  face

difficulties meeting the household expenditures  at  the  new

level of pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in sum, Mr Speaker, the union leaders feel that

retrenchment  benefits  are  not  a  windfall.   Retrenchment

benefits are a buffer against an unknown future for a  worker

who  is retrenched.  And so we do have to look very carefully

at  the principles of applying retrenchment benefit caps  and

the desired outcomes of the new structure we want to look at.

On  the other hand, there were many workers retrenched in the

last two years who did not receive any benefits.  And that is

because  under the law, employers need not give any  benefits

to retrenched

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>

workers.  So surely as we review the caps, we ought  to  also

review the situation where retrenched workers get no benefits

in  those  companies that do not have a collective  agreement

with their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome the Minister's assurance that we will

have  a tripartite study into this issue.  We would urge that

we  should  take time to do the study and not rush  into  it,

that  we should carefully weigh the principles that go behind

retrenchment  benefits,  and we  should  choose  the  desired

outcomes  very carefully.  But, on the whole, we welcome  the

Minister's  assurance  that  the  Ministry  will   urge   the

employers to streamline the wage structure so as to make  our

workers more competitive in the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we move into the knowledge-based economy, as we

have  all  these  schemes and courses  to  help  our  workers

prepare  for  the  new  type  of economy,  some  workers  are

worried.  They are worried that they cannot learn new  skills

and  new knowledge.  They are worried that if they are placed

in classes where there are younger workers, will they be able

to  learn  as quickly as those young workers?  Will  they  be

holding back the classes?  When I hear these worries, this is

something which I try to help assure them with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us are parents. Many of our workers are

parents.  How do we bring up a baby?  There are no Government

subsidies  and  SRP plans.  We do not go for formal  courses.

We do not ask for employers to give us subsidised training to

bring  up  our baby.  What do we do?  We learn.  We  ask  our

parents.   We ask our grandparents, our colleagues  who  have

children.   And  along the way, as the baby  grows  from  one

month to a year, to PSLE, to "O" levels, we continually learn

and  re-learn  and  respond as our child  grows.   No  formal

courses, no subsidies.  We do that until the child grows  up,

gets  to work, and even as he or she marries, we want to help

him  choose the right spouse.  And we learn how these  should

be  done  -  all  on our own, and in a continual  process  of

learning  and re-learning and responding to each child  in  a

different way from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>

another  child.  So all of us can learn and do learn all  the

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why is it that we need to tell workers to be thinking

workers  and learning workers?  Is it not strange, Sir,  that

people,  the  only  creatures on earth  who  are  capable  of

thinking, of exercising judgement, are asked to think and  to

learn?  Before Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam says that it is because the

PAP puts fear into people, let me suggest the answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the old days when people were farmers or

hunters,  everyone was a knowledge worker.  If a  farmer  was

not  a  knowledge worker, he would starve.  Because  he  must

read  the  weather and make sure that the pests do  not  come

after  his crops and know how to deal with those pests.   And

when  the floods come, when the droughts come, what  does  he

do?   He learns all the time.  And then he grows a good  crop

and  he  becomes a good farmer.  Otherwise,  he  starves.   A

hunter must be a knowledge hunter, otherwise he gets eaten up

by wild animals, and that is the end of the hunter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we went into the industrial economy, something

changed.    The   industrial  economy  made  workers   become

machines.  When one man used to make one chair in a week,  we

spread out the job over several people.  One person just does

the legs, somebody sews the cushions and somebody hammers the

whole  chair  together.  That team produces many more  chairs

than  if  one person makes one chair, a complete  chair.   So

what  do we do in that industrial economy situation?  We must

spread  out  the  work so that each one just does  his  part,

following  all the specifications, no deviations, and  passes

that part to the next person so that person receives the part

as  he expects it.  No deviation was allowed; no thinking was

allowed.    We  did  that  because  the  machines  were   not

sophisticated  enough to do the thinking,  and  the  machines

were  not sophisticated enough to do things that people could

do because of our dexterity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today we have moved yet again, because the machines,

the robots, the computers, can do many things in a more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>

dexterous  way,  in a more precise way than people  can.   So

those  machines can do things better than people.  Then  what

do  people do?  Sir, I would like to share an example that is

taken  from  Honda.   Recently,  Honda  in  Japan  wanted  to

streamline its process of producing cars.  They had different

lines  to  produce  different  model  cars  because  it   was

difficult  for machines and computers to convert or  use  the

same  production line to produce different models.  What they

had  done recently was to put some workers to manipulate  the

production  line so that different models could  be  produced

from  the  same line.  And this could be done only by  people

because  the  people there manning the job  could  think  and

exercise  judgement and make those changes as  required  that

machines could not do.  So post-industrial revolution, in the

knowledge  economy,  people are employed to  become  thinking

workers again.  And this is a situation we are in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, knowledge and the knowledge-based economy are

not about knowledge workers alone.  The knowledge economy has

got  knowledge products, products that embody knowledge, that

have  got all the knowledge built in, so that we do not  have

to  do  the  thinking.   The machines do  all  the  thinking.

Knowledge-based  economy also has knowledge processes  as  in

the Honda example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there great value for knowledge in the knowledge-based economy? Let me give an example of how knowledge is so

valuable and yet costs practically nothing.  Recently,  in  a

supermarket in America, they installed a new computer.   That

computer  could collect data on what customers bought.   They

discovered something very interesting, which is - people  who

bought disposable nappies also bought beer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found this very strange and sent people to observe

why people bought beer and nappies.  And they discovered that

when  a family has a new baby, the father takes leave to look

after  the  baby and goes to the supermarket to  buy  things,

including

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>

nappies.   And  because he is at home, watching  baseball  or

football on TV, he also buys beer.  So that is why people who

bought  nappies  also bought beer.  In the  supermarket,  the

nappies  were  placed in one section with the baby  products,

and  the  beer was placed in the alcoholic products  section.

What  the supermarket manager did was to put some shelves  of

beer  next to the nappies section, and sale of beer  went  up

tremendously.  Here is an example of knowledge  acquired  and

knowledge applied, and the application of the knowledge costs

nothing.  It costs nothing to move the shelf of beer next  to

the nappies.  Yet sales went up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So application of knowledge is not just about IT, about

technology.   Technology is important, but  it  is  not  just

about  that.   It  is also not just about individual  workers

being  trained  to learn and re-learn new knowledge  and  new

skills,  because individual workers working on their own  are

also not enough.  The harnessing of knowledge is a collective

effort.  It is a team effort within a small group, within the

company, within the whole industry, within the whole economy.

It is a collective effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our tourist industry, we have thousands of

workers  employed in the tourist industry -  hotel  managers,

waitresses, taxi-drivers, tour guides.  Suppose we  are  able

to  harness the knowledge of all these workers about tourists

who  come to Singapore.  Every tourist who comes to Singapore

looks for something to eat, see or do.  Our taxi-drivers know

that  Japanese tourists like to go to certain places;  German

tourists like to go to yet other places.  If we could harness

all that knowledge, we will be able to target our advertising

messages to individual countries in a sharper way to  attract

many  more tourist arrivals.  If only we can harness all that

knowledge  that exists among all the workers in  the  tourism

industry, how much and how rich that knowledge will be.   And

it is not just a question of knowledge.  Everyone has his own

experience.  We need to extract them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to propose to do something. Sir, in the

70s, 80s, early 90s, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>

emphasis  was on productivity.  We went all over  the  world,

including Japan, to learn about productivity tools -  quality

circles, QCCs, WITs, five "S"s, and other tools, to  help  us

become   more   productive.   And   we   systematically   and

conscientiously developed the Quality Circle movement so that

every  worker in Singapore has a set of simple tools that  he

can apply to become more productive as a worker in a team, in

the company.  How wonderful it would be if we had a tool that

could  help  us  acquire  knowledge, share  knowledge,  apply

knowledge  and  generate new knowledge in a  way  that  would

bring  together  knowledge, multiply, branch  off,  converge,

diverge  and  get new ideas constantly out of old  knowledge.

And  more  important,  Sir, if we can have  a  tool  that  is

transportable,  that  is easily taught,  easily  learned.   A

worker  learns  to use this tool.  When he  goes  to  another

company, he can use the same tool and transport it to another

team,  to  another  workplace  and  continue  to  help   that

workplace,  that  company acquire and  share  knowledge,  and

generate knowledge.  How wonderful that would be.  There  may

be  such tools existing; let us learn them.  There may not be

such tools existing; then let us invent that tool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to harness all that knowledge for our

knowledge-based  economy, then perhaps we need  to  change  a

certain  mantra that we chant.  Sir, you will recognise  this

mantra.   Once in a while, it comes out in this  House.   And

the  mantra is: "Singapore is a small country with no natural

resources.  Our people are our only resource."  It has become

a  cliche.  People do not want to use it nowadays.  But it is

an important statement.  It reminds us of our constraints and

vulnerabilities.  But it also gives us hope that, as a  small

country, we can succeed, we can survive, we can achieve.  But

if we are able to harness knowledge collectively, then we can

change that statement to something like this: "Singapore is a

small  country with no natural resources.  Knowledge  is  our

only resource."  And if we adopt that as a working principle,

then  something changes.  Our horizon broadens  tremendously.

Because if we look at people as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>

our resource, then the population is small.  But knowledge is

limitless.  Population grows slowly, but knowledge multiplies

and  multiplies  rapidly  given the right  environment.   Our

people  have  mental and physical limits.  But  knowledge  is

inexhaustible.   And if we are able to find the  right  tools

that   are   easily   learned,  easily  taught   and   easily

transportable, then we will thrive and stay one step ahead in

the future global knowledge-based competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address also contains statements on

Manpower  21.   Manpower  21  is  a  bold  and  comprehensive

blueprint.  It has got six strategies to build Singapore into

a talent capital.  Again, Sir, the unions are in full support

of  Manpower  21.   NTUC  would  like  to  support  it  -  in

particular, in three areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the manpower information system. It is a

system that will give information about job availability, the

trends  and the courses available, and so on.  This would  be

very helpful to workers.  The unions have asked to be closely

involved in the development of this system, because it should

not  be a system that can be understood and used only  by  IT

experts.   The ordinary worker should be able to  access  the

system  and get all this knowledge in a simple form  that  he

can use and apply to help himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on the National Skills Recognition System. It

is  a  very  exciting new concept.  It is a  way  of  testing

workers  for  the skills that they have already  learned  and

qualifying  them in modular ways, in bite-size ways  so  that

they  acquire qualifications to do the jobs, not just in  the

company, but if the company closes down or restructures, they

can  use  that  qualification to apply for  a  job  in  other

companies in the industry.  In Manpower 21, it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It facilitates learning among less educated workers and

NSRS  courses  should have flexible entry  requirements.   It

must be a flexible and dynamic system that can be continually

updated to incorporate new industries and to reflect changing

skills needs."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NTUC will help to identify these needs with MOM

and  with  the employers.  But what we ask is this: that  the

tests

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>

should  be  to  allow workers to qualify, to  allow  in  more

workers  who  otherwise  are not  considered  qualified.   It

should  not be a system that becomes bureaucratic  over  time

and  with  tests  that keep workers out so that  they  remain

unqualified for jobs in the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in the Manpower 21 plan, there is a section that

encourages   the   promotion  of  best  HR  practices   among

companies.  Sir, we think it is a very good thing to do,  but

promotion of best HR practices should not remain at the level

of  holding  seminars and getting consultants to  talk  about

what are good practices.  NTUC would like to suggest that  we

go  three  steps further.  First, HR practitioners, SNEF  and

the  HR institute in Singapore should draw up a code of  good

HR  practices.  A simple code that tells everyone:  in a good

company,  for  a  good  employer, what  constitutes  good  HR

management? This is so that we can all understand and respond

to that code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the NTUC will contribute to that process by

drawing  up  at  the  same  time a code  of  good  industrial

relations  (IR)  practices because we are a  responsible  and

responsive  union  movement and we would  like  to  place  on

record  the  kind  of trade union movement  we  want  to  be.

Third,  we should put together these two parts, the  HR  code

and  the  IR  code,  as a statement of the  kind  of  labour-management  relations we wish to achieve in Singapore.   This

code  can  be a simplified one with terms that can easily  be

understood  and implemented.  Each company can  either  adopt

this code or adapt from it to suit the company's missions and

objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should add a third part to the two sections, which is

a  statement  of shared vision and shared future between  the

workers  and the management of the companies.  And  together,

this   document  will  tell  everyone  -  the  workers,   the

management - what is expected of each side.  The codes should

not  be  just words.  Each code, when drawn up, should  be  a

statement of commitment by HR, by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>

employers  and  by the unions, of the kind of strong  labour-management relations we want to form in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address is a very comprehensive

one.   The  workers' concerns were addressed, and the  unions

and I would like to support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  speak in support of the motion in the  name  of  Mr

Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fitting that the thrust of the Presidential

Address  is  to  exhort  Singaporeans  to  build  our  future

together.   The  problems  that  Singaporeans  face  and  the

Singapore   economy  faces  are  quite  challenging.    These

problems  affect all of us Singaporeans, whether heartlanders

or cosmopolitans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I do not subscribe to this differentiation

of  Singaporeans.  I feel it is unnecessary.  We know in  any

country, whether in China, the United States, the UK,  India,

Malaysia  or  Singapore, there will always be  some  who,  by

their capabilities, by their connection, would have access to

higher  education or opportunities to work with  people  from

many countries, travel internationally for work and business.

These  people, by their training and work and command of  the

English  Language  or  a  second language,  can  work  in  an

overseas country.  These people succeed in large measure  due

to the opportunities which their societies gave them in their

formative  years.  We should therefore try to  give  everyone

the  maximum opportunities to excel and go far.  We know that

not  all of us start life equally.  But we have done  so  for

many  years.   So  I feel it is not necessary  to  make  that

distinction  now and remind people that there  are  different

classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there really such distinct categories? I wonder

whether  all  the maids and construction workers and  factory

operators  from  the  developing countries  who  go  to  work

overseas  and  earn relatively high income to  send  home  to

their compatriots will be considered 'cosmopolitans' in their

own countries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer to take the approach which the Education

Minister  yesterday elaborated - to educate all  Singaporeans

to  be "world-ready and yet rooted in Singapore".  I am  glad

that  the Education Minister reiterated that the teaching  of

values  to  our students has not been forgotten to make  them

committed to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer this simpler way of forging a nation - the

better  educated,  more  capable,  knowing  their  roots  and

identified  with  the  national values, the  national  goals,

prepared  to  work  for the betterment  of  his  country  and

fellowmen.   If we continue to teach our young to  be  world-ready  and  yet rooted in Singapore, we would not lose  them,

just  because of globalisation and the IT culture.  And these

values  of  commitment  are equally  relevant  in  a  modern,

technological, knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we teach our children that they should be

proud of the Singapore heritage, of how the country and their

parents  and brothers and sisters have done well against  all

the  odds, all Singaporeans will be inspired by the Singapore

Story.   Their hearts beat as one.  The moment we  categorise

them into heartlanders and cosmopolitans, we are creating  an

unnecessary divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our economy faces many serious challenges in the

years  ahead.  It is not just about going by how many percent

per year.  It is really about how we can sustain a meaningful

quality of life for our workforce, our working population and

a  rapidly  ageing  one - a large portion of  whom  may  find

increasing difficulties in staying employed with an  adequate

income.  Many of them need to continue working to be able  to

live comfortably.  There are about 700,000 workers in the  45

years  and above category with only a secondary two level  of

education.  In a rapidly changing economy, there is always  a

danger  of  not being able to stay employed.  The  impact  of

this  on  our  social  fabric  is  something  deserving   our

attention.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the greatest challenges our Government and

economy  will face is to set forth the platform and strategic

implementation   for  our  training  and  skills   retraining

programmes  for  our  people  to  launch  and  implement  the

Manpower 21 plan.  The National Skills Recognition Scheme and

the   'one   institution  two  systems'  approach'   in   our

educational  and  training  institutes  are  very   important

pillars.  We must implement this fast because there  is  very

little  time.   The  sooner  we  implement  this  across  our

industries,  the  better chance we give our  people  to  stay

competitive and give them a better chance to a better quality

of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important thing that we must do is to

professionalise  more the jobs we create in  the  service  or

manufacturing sectors.  This will allow more people  to  work

efficiently and proudly in the service sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge-based economy does not exist in a vacuum.

Just  now,  we  have  heard my colleague,  Mr  Matthias  Yao,

expound  very  deeply into the meaning of  a  knowledge-based

economy.   I  fully agree with him.  Long before the  use  of

minis  and  PCs, the Americans and the Japanese were  already

applying critical knowledge systems in their manufacturing or

production  processes.  For them, the knowledge-based  system

was  fused  with the production system.  In the manufacturing

sector,  they started by being craftsmen.  Then, the machines

replaced  the  craftsmen and the large  scale  production  of

goods replaced more and more skills in the jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economists not long ago measured the comparative

advantage  of  countries  by their  skill  intensity  in  the

production  process.   Knowledge-based  systems   were   also

present  but  not so intense.  Today, production and  service

sectors require higher knowledge intensity to be competitive.

It does not mean that skills are no more important.  More and

more  sophisticated machines in production can  be  built  to

replace  specific operations and skills but it does not  mean

you  should throw the baby out with the bath water. We should

upgrade the skills of our workers. Hence,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>

I   find  the  Manpower  Minister's  speech  yesterday   very

appropriate with his elaboration on the programmes  that  are

available now to enable workers to upgrade their skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, it has been found that the service

sector  is  the one that gave the most employment during  the

period when the IT sector and productivity growth was highest

in  the last few years.  For many workers who are not  so  IT

savvy,  there  is  still hope in the KBE.  Even  in  the  new

economy,  people  need to eat, drink and  travel.  They  need

goods to be delivered, served and to be entertained. We  need

to  raise  the level of skills in our workers, especially  in

certain  sectors  -  construction is  one  of  them;  retail,

cleaning  and the general service sectors.  Professionalising

these  jobs will give better efficiency, justify more  value-added and productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot expect every Singaporean to be able to say he

works  in  a  knowledge  economy.  But  we  can  ensure  that

production processes be fused with a significant component of

the  knowledge-based system so that our competitive  edge  is

sharpened  and  maintained, and our people at the  downstream

services continue to stay employed, and earn a decent living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once asked a well-known American economist who

pioneered  the  study  on the knowledge economy,  Prof.  Paul

Romer,  whether  there  is a typical sectoral  profile  in  a

knowledge-based economy.  In other words, whether there is  a

special pattern in the sectoral distribution of the GDP in  a

knowledge-based economy.  He said quite correctly that  there

was none.  You do not even need to be IT savvy.  Knowledge of

IT is only the enabler.  The business is all up to you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I feel very reassured that the Government is

still very much focused on making our manufacturing sector  a

driving  sector, maintaining at 25% share of GDP, to  prevent

the hollowing out of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>

economy.  This is important for the manufacturing sector will

provide the base and the linkage for jobs and exports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Singaporean workers should be assured, because of

the  changes  we are going to introduce to our  training  and

work certification process. I ask all workers not to miss out

on  the many avenues and opportunities for training that  the

NTUC has established jointly with the Government.  I wish  to

remind  all my Singaporean workers that it was the  NTUC  who

sounded  the bell early last year on the impending issues  of

employability and retraining for our workers and came up with

the  positive solutions.  Over the last one and a half years,

much  has  been  achieved  by  the  NTUC  together  with  the

tripartite  partners.  Today, there is a Skills Redevelopment

Programme workers can tap on.  Our workers ought to be  proud

that  there is a labour movement, led by leaders who can  see

further than many, the storms on the horizon and prepare  the

ground with the solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  giving me this opportunity to speak on  the  motion

standing in the name of Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many speakers have extolled the merits of the vision

sketched  by  the President and some reservations  have  been

expressed.  I share in the excitement over the vision  as  it

promises  much to look forward to. I see it as  an  extensive

home improvement programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address is but a sketch of what

Singapore  can  be - a progressive nation with  its  citizens

playing  an  active  role  in  his  journey  into  the   next

millennium.   The devil is in the details, the  parts  to  be

painted  in - the choice of colours and shades.  Not everyone

will  have  the  same  view of the  completed  picture.   Not

everyone will see the sketch the way it is nor will they have

the same interpretation of the picture being painted.  Whilst

it will be impossible to cater to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>

everyone's  expectations, there must be an  understanding  of

what they are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, broadly speaking, there are three milieus in any

society  -  conveniently termed as lower,  middle  and  upper

income  groups.   Each milieu will see things differently  as

their  priorities in life are different.  A  "need"  for  one

group  may  be  inconsequential for another group.  Some  can

afford  to  spend a weekend at golf whilst others must  scrap

for a better living, sometimes a matter of survival for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, as one of the pioneer counsellors for

ex-drug addicts, a counselee said to me, "It is easy for you.

With your educational qualification, you do not have to worry

about  getting  a  decent job. My future  is  different  from

yours.  So how can you truly understand what I feel."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people feel that there are no longer any truly poor

in Singapore.  Yet, if they are more alert, they may spot the

elderly  hunched  lady  dragging home her  precious  cart  of

cardboard materials at the bewitching hour whilst most people

are in sweet slumber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst everyone will accept the importance of

education  and  the need to invest time and effort  into  it,

some  children have to cope with helping out at the  family's

business  and  some may even have to adopt the parental  role

and  be  both mum and dad to their siblings.  These  children

are handicapped in their educational pursuit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether one is cosmopolitan, a heartlander, or a bit of

each,  one's  view  of  things  and  expectations  will    be

significantly influenced by the milieu that he or she belongs

to.   In the call to work together and to commit not just  to

Singapore, but also to one another, there must be recognition

that  there are different milieus in our society.  There  has

first  to  be an awareness of this divide and there  must  be

genuine  empathy  for  each other's fears,  difficulties  and

aspirations.  The concerns of the milieus cut across races  - it  is  the  same  for  each  milieu,  whatever  their  race.

Perhaps, it is the desire to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>

sensitive that we do not want to recognise this divide.   But

in so doing, we become less sensitive to each other's needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There cannot be social cohesion if any one milieu feels,

rightly or wrongly, that it is being treated unfairly. It  is

only  by conscious effort that such misunderstandings can  be

minimised.  There is a need to find ways to explain  policies

in the language and in the context of each milieu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much attention was paid to involve a cross section of

Singaporeans in the development of the S21 vision.   However,

at  the  end of the day, the intelligentsia are the ones  who

packaged and presented it to the people.  The challenge is to

help  people of all milieus see that S21 is for them and that

they  all  have  a  role to play.  The people  who  keep  our

environment  clean  and healthy must see that  they  too  are

contributing to the well-being of our nation and are just  as

important  as  those generating exports.   It  is  only  when

everyone  at every stratum can feel that they are playing  an

important role in the progress of our nation that the  spirit

of S21 can take root, be nourished and grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social cohesion must be the foundation, the canvas upon

which  we sketch and paint our vision for tomorrow.   Without

social  cohesion,  we have little chance  of  completing  the

picture  of  Singapore in the new millennium.  The  sketching

presented will end up as just blotches of paint with clashing

colours and shades, to be passed on as 21st century art.   It

may belong to everyone but only a few will appreciate it.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to  support the motion standing in the  name  of  Mr

Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address promised that the

Government  will  be  promoting active  citizenship  "to  get

Singaporeans to play a full part in shaping our future."   Mr

Singh has waxed lyrical about active citizenship and I cannot

match his eloquence and wisdom on the subject.  I wish merely

to add two points to help us

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>

understand the full import of these two simple words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, active citizens must have realistic and informed

expectations  and  opinions.  Second,  active  citizens  must

learn to disagree without being divisive.  Let me elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Singh pointed out in his speech, we have a new

generation of Singaporeans who expect to be consulted and  to

have their voices heard.  The Government has promised to hear

them.   At  the same time, as Mr Singh has noted,  those  who

propose alternatives must be prepared to defend them  in  the

robust arena of debate.  I would add that the debate,  to  be

meaningful,  must  also be well-informed and  have  realistic

expectations.   Otherwise, the debate will  end  up  with  no

greater  merit than the bar brawl over a drunkard's  view  of

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, those who argue for more financial welfare

for the poor, along the lines of western social systems, lose

their  credibility if they do not know why the very societies

which have these systems are trying to ditch them.  As Mr Lim

Boon  Heng  pointed out on Monday, welfare and  minimum  wage

levels  in these countries are predicated upon providing  the

poor  with shelter and basic needs, with the bulk of the  aid

going  to  the  cost of shelter.  In Singapore,  90%  of  our

people already own their own homes.  Demanding the same level

or  model of welfare would be uninformed, unrealistic, unwise

and an altogether unfair debating point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As another example, journalist Chua Lee Hoong has

expressed her dismay that MPs in this House are not following

up   on  each  other's  points,  affirming,  elaborating   or

countering.  She  totally misunderstands  the  purpose  of  a

Parliamentary debate to thank the President for his  Address.

Procedurally, the debate is on Mr Singh's motion, whether  or

not  to  thank the President.  It is a device for Members  to

explore the issues raised by the President's Address and  the

Addenda.  If we were to debate Mr Singh's points

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>

alone,  this would be a very narrow debate indeed!   She  has

probably  also not informed herself of how debate is  carried

out  in other Parliaments.  Her criticism is thus unfair,  as

unfair  as  her  comment that His Excellency the  President's

Address is devoid of wit and passion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the President's Address is a ceremonial speech

outlining   the  Government's  programme.   It   is   not   a

politician's  speech. The passion within it  is  understated.

Surely, she does not expect him to punctuate his Speech  with

shouts of "Merdeka"?  Has she never seen the Queen of England

deliver   similar   speeches   in   stately   fashion?    The

Constitutional   convention  allows  for  passion   only   in

politicians' speeches!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, Miss Chua certainly has not seen Parliamentarians

debating  in  the  Lok  Sabha  in  India.   There,  as  here,

Parliamentary  time  is  short, the  opportunities  to  speak

limited  and  the  agenda  long.   Parliamentarians  need  to

espouse  the views of their constituents; they have  to  push

the  interests  and promote programmes for the well-being  of

those  they represent.  So, in the Lok Sabha, it is a  common

sight  to  see  several MPs all talking at the top  of  their

voices  at  the same time.  Would they be listening  to  each

other, I wonder?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, you have the fine example of

Congressmen  in the US House of Representatives.   I  visited

that  august  institution  in 1985  when  the  House  was  in

session.  In a chamber that sits 435 people, I saw a  handful

seated and one standing and speaking.  At first, I thought he

was  rehearsing  his speech, until I saw the Speaker  of  the

House  move  to  make  a  ruling on  something.   In  the  US

Congress,  the  more important work is done in  its  hallowed

halls  -  and  thus the word "lobby"  -  not in the  debating

chamber.   Not many Congressmen were listening to his  debate

to counter it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House, Sir, I am glad to say, is more orderly than

the  Lok  Sabha  and  more diligent  than  the  US  House  of

Representatives.  We have many points to push, many petitions

to  plead, and some pet projects to promote.  We do not do it

for show, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>

to  air  the views of our citizens.  To paraphrase the Senior

Minister who said this before in this House, if what  Members

say  in  here do not resonate outside, we are done for.   The

debate on the President's Address is not a school debate with

thrust  and  counter thrust.  In the past,  many  ideas  were

floated in these debates, some of which were later picked  up

by  the  Front  Bench and incorporated into the  Government's

programmes.  We do not wish it any other way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point on active citizens is that we must learn

to  disagree without coming to blows.  Robust debate  is  not

necessarily a personal attack.  Passion must not be  mistaken

for  aggression.  As Mr Singh asked, "Can we take the  heat?"

If we cannot, we should not stay in the kitchen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a student in America, and again in England, I

often saw my friends argue with each other (and even with the

Professors) until their faces were blue.  And yet, they never

became  enemies.   Here,  in  our  culture,  the  moment  you

contradict  someone  just a little too vigorously,  you  have

lost  a  friend.  For active citizens to benefit from  active

debates,  we  must  learn to take as well  as  we  give,  and

adjourn for a happy drink together afterwards.  "Defeat"  can

be  accepted  with  grace,  not  a  feeling  of  humiliation.

Disagreement does not mean division.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have learnt that we can agree to disagree, it

would  not  make  headlines anymore  every  time  a  Minister

appears  to  disagree with another, or a Member of Parliament

does  not align himself with a Government position.  It  does

not mean that the PAP has begun to split, nor that the Member

in  question is embittered and is "hitting out".  Such is the

grist of active gossip, not citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have occasion to disagree with the Government,

we  must have the conviction that we are right and are  ready

to  defend  our stand.  That is why we must be well-informed.

If  we  hit hard, we must expect to be hit hard.  As Mr Singh

said, in moving this motion, this Government is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>

not  known for the subtlety of its replies.  Perhaps as  time

goes  by,  all of us will learn how to modulate our blows  in

debate,  though the calibration is an art to be  learnt  from

experience,  not a science that is acquired from  the  books.

While we call on the Government to be more thick-skinned when

criticised, we must not apply double standards.   The  active

citizen  must  learn to be thick-skinned too!  Ask  Mr  Simon

Tay,  or perhaps Prof. Walter Woon.  No active citizen should

throw  in the towel and proclaim that he has stopped  because

he  is now cowering in fear.  If he fears his own shadow, the

public  forum  and its floodlights is not a  place  where  he

should be found.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address offered another set of

buzzwords:   Singapore as a "knowledge-based economy".   Sir,

permit me next to say a few words on this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is acquired, usually from education. This is

probably   why  many  Members  before  me  have  majored   on

educational reform.  Our educational system has traditionally

been  knowledge-intensive, pressed down  by  dedicated  drill

masters.   In the Information Age, however, knowledge  has  a

very  short shelf life.  What you learn in school may  become

obsolete  a short six years after you graduate.   It  is  not

productive  in  such   a  world to  cram  our  children  with

knowledge.   We  must equip them with skill sets  which  will

help  them  acquire useful knowledge all through their  lives

and sound values for them to discern between good and evil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education in such a world should not be examination-interrupted as it is currently. There are important

examinations  at the end of Primary 3, 4, 6; Secondary  2,  4

and  Junior  College.  If we set aside two months to  prepare

for  each  examination, we would have wasted a full one  year

doing  nothing but cram.  We would have lost productivity  in

the economy too, because parents have to take leave from work

to  rehearse  the  children for their examinations.   Perhaps

school in the future will not be examination-interrupted  but

examination-terminated.  One graduation examination, the  'A'

levels.  I am thrilled therefore that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>

the Minister for Education is taking a step in that direction

by considering dropping the 'O' level  for some students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want "thinking schools". For that not to be an empty

slogan,  we  must allow students time to think;  time  to  be

creative;  time to sieve good from bad, gold from dross.   On

the   Internet,   there   are  lots   of   information,   and

misinformation.  Our children must learn how  to  choose  and

discern  what is harmful and what is not.  If school is  full

of  examinations and cramming, how would they  find  time  to

think?   Ian Buruma condemns us as a nation afraid to  think.

Actually,  our problem is that we have no time to think.   To

my knowledge, only a certain Member without a constituency is

afraid  to  think, as I noticed that he plagiarised  a  whole

chunk  of  Buruma's  article and passed it  off  as  his  own

analysis of Singapore in his speech during this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children are so busy that they have no time to be

children,  no time to play.  I agree wholeheartedly  with  Mr

Peh  Chin Hua that we should stop driving them from class  to

class, tuition to tuition, enrichment programme to enrichment

programme.  To everything, there is a season  -  a season for

study,  a season for play; a season for stress, a season  for

de-stress.  Play is productive, even creative.  Why are we so

afraid  to  let our children play?  So afraid that  we  teach

them Primary One things in kindergarten!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so glad that the Senior Minister of State for

Education has declared that henceforth this will stop.  I  do

hope that the Ministry will next stop the hideous practice of

ranking schools purely on academic performance.  Rank if  you

must,  but do not forget to give high scores to schools which

give  their students a balanced education, rounding  them  up

with sports, arts and character-building programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address has clearly stated that school

curricula  will be revised to cater for these.  I  am  deeply

appreciative, as many Singaporean parents would be, with that

promise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the one year that we save in not having

examinations,  we  should send our children  for  sports  and

music  camps  perhaps, or SIF overseas volunteer  programmes,

student  exchange  programmes,  Operation  Raleigh  projects,

Outward  Bound School.  We should challenge them to climb  Mt

Everest,  Mt Kinabalu or at least Mt Ophir.  Presently,  they

do  not  even  have time to climb Mt Faber!  We cannot  allow

this to continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, we must not forget that we have

taught them to pledge, "to build a democratic society,  based

on   justice  and  equality,  so  as  to  achieve  happiness,

prosperity  and progress for our nation."  They cannot  learn

about   a   democratic   society  by  suffering   six   major

examinations in 12 years of schooling.  They must leave their

books   and   visit   Parliament,  the  courts,   the   civil

institutions.  They cannot learn about justice  and  equality

from  textbooks  and endless assessment  papers.   They  must

experience  these  from  interaction with  their  classmates,

multi-racial classmates at that, and with their community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, let me say that hitherto, the

Government  in all its policies has over-emphasised,  dare  I

say,  "achieving  prosperity  and  progress"  and  left   out

"happiness"  for the most part.  The Chinese version  of  our

pledge refers to "happiness" as xin fu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) which,

loosely translated, can mean "blessing".  Blessing is a state

of contentment, much deeper than happiness, and it comes from

spiritual  and  emotional well-being.  Even happiness  itself

cannot  come  simply from material prosperity  and  progress.

Happiness  comes from fond memories of Singapore,  our  home.

Our  hearts must beat, as the President said in his  Address,

for  Singapore - for its foods and smells, for its sounds and

colours, its history, its landmarks and its people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must learn to restrain our urge to demolish every

building  we see that does not fit into our plans.   We  must

stop  removing  the landmarks of our history.   Architectural

merit must not be the only consideration for preservation.  I

regret, for example, the demolition of my alma mater

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>

many  years  ago in the past, the first school  in  Singapore

with  a  very,  very  large  history,  because  it  was   not

economical or distinctive enough architecturally to save.  Is

the  National Library building at Stamford Road   really  not

possible to save and refurbish for future generations to mark

our history?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness too, Sir, comes from making life more

meaningful  for others, especially those less fortunate  than

ourselves.  That is active citizenship.  Happiness too  comes

from having fun.  We say that every Singaporean counts.   His

welfare  counts.   For him, we need to make Singapore  a  fun

place  to  live in, not just because it helps us  to  make  a

quick  tourist dollar, but because it is what we have pledged

to  do.  I am glad that finally in MITA's programmes, we have

a  plan  to promote fun in Singapore.  As many of our Western

friends might say, "Come on Singapore, loosen up!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I am grateful to join in this

debate.   I  wish  to speak on this Government's  promise  to

focus  on  people and to promote active citizenship.   In  so

doing,  there are three fundamental questions we need to  ask

ourselves: (1) Why is this important?  (2)  What specifically

should  and  will be done, and by whom?  (3)  What  obstacles

and limits stand in our way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to begin with an observation not about

Singapore  but  about Vietnam, where I have been  and  why  I

missed  the first two days of this debate.  We are not  alone

in  facing  change  and the new millennium for  our  society.

Vietnam  is  in something of a dilemma.  They recognise  that

they need to open up their country to the world market and to

foreign  investors.  This is their doi moi policy.   However,

they  are concerned about foreign influence on their  society

and how society and politics will change as they open up.  So

they seem to muddle through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very astute observer remarked to me, "the problem is

that  they  won the war."  The problem is that they  won  the

war.  This statement is not to wish that they lost.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>

this statement acutely sees the problem of success.  When you

have  won  the  war,  you believe you have  the  formula  for

success.  You have the veterans you must take care of, and  a

system  that brought victory.  It is therefore very  hard  to

change,  to say, "we need something new".  Instead, there  is

some tinkering, some muddling around, half measures.  In this

sense,  past  success inhibits real and necessary  change  to

meet the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, where people lose, there is justification

and  occasion  for  widespread change.  Something  like  what

Japan experienced after World War II, just as before, in  the

Meiji  restoration.  A crisis and a failure bring  a  country

the  opportunity for a deep change, a transformation.   Japan

is,  by  the way, now looking at a commission, much like  the

Singapore 21, on Japan's role in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, of course, is very different from Vietnam or

Japan.   We  did not fight the kind of war (although  in  the

1970s,  the  conventional wisdom said that we  might  if  the

dominoes  in  Southeast Asia fell).  But we did  win  through

another struggle for economic success and survival.   We  too

had succeeded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In achieving this success, this victory, we have our own

veterans  and our own system of society and politics.   These

have served us well in the past and in the present, and it is

very  difficult to abandon them abruptly.  Indeed, there  are

those  among  us who also fear that if we open up  too  fast,

they  are  not sure what influences will work on our society,

and change our politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we then too successful to truly change? Will we

just simply tinker around and hope to muddle through the 21st

century?   Or can we truly commit ourselves to necessary  and

real change for an active people sector?  Much depends on our

motivation.



<br><br><i>Why do we need active citizens?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my first point. Why do we need this

change?   Why  do we need active citizens?  Why  do  we  need

people to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>

actively   participate   in  the   nation's   affairs?    The

Presidential Address gives us two main reasons for this goal.

First,  active  citizens  can  improve  Government  policies.

Second,  active citizenship and participation gives people  a

stake  in  the  country.  The second of these two  reasons  - giving all a stake - ties with the overall goal of developing

stronger  social cohesion to make sure we gel together  as  a

people.   This  is important as we prepare for  a  knowledge-based  economy  because such an economy will tend  to  reward

people very differently and can potentially divide us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call for active citizenship in this sense has a very

rational economic basis.  First, and most immediately, we can

improve  on  policies.  Second, and more broadly, "heartware"

is  to  be  the  social bond for a vast  and  rapid  economic

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these rational and economic reasons enough to

motivate real and necessary change?  Some Singaporeans  will,

of course, always queue up if there is a sale.  If there is a

dollar  sign,  they will queue up.  For some people,  it  is.

But not for all of us, and not always.  Some of us respond to

other stimulus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these is the goal of becoming a "democracy".

When I use this word, I do not want to embroil this House  in

a  debate about definitions. Democracy is a loaded term.   It

is often used to mean a certain form of liberal democracy, as

we  see in some Western societies.  But here, I use the  word

"democracy",  in the terms of our own pledge.  We  pledge  to

build  a "democratic society, based on justice and equality".

If  we hold true to this goal, this ideal of democracy,  this

can be a third and potent reason to have active citizens.  In

a  democracy,  more than any other society or system,  people

count.   Literally  they vote, and their vote  counts.   More

than  that,  they  participate in  the  society  and  in  the

political processes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, I do not see that active citizens are an

option, a luxury for good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>

times.  They are essential to face the coming challenges  for

Singapore to be a home amidst the open, competitive,  rapidly

changing and often turbulent world that is coming.  We should

not  wish for a crisis or to lose a war in order to have real

change.   But we have to be motivated for real change.   Only

then  can  the  goals  set  by the  Presidential  Address  be

reached.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I must confess that I am disappointed on

this  point of active citizens by the plans announced by  the

different  Ministries in their Addenda  to  the  Presidential

Address.



<br><br><i>What specifically should and will be done, and by whom?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with this in the second question: What

specifically should and will be done, and by whom?  If we  go

through  the Addenda of the different Ministries,  there  are

relatively few references to plans to make active citizenship

possible.    Perhaps  they  have  their  own  more  immediate

concerns  with existing policies and plans.  There is,  after

all,  no  Ministry in overall charge of this  initiative  for

active citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Ministries do mention plans for active

citizens, these plans do not seem to me to go very far beyond

what  we  already have.  Take, for example, the  Ministry  of

Community  Development's plans for the Feedback  Unit.   This

Unit is very important for active citizens to be heard and to

also listen.  But if you look at paragraph 9 of the Addendum,

and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Feedback Unit will reach out to more Singaporeans

to  obtain varied and representative feedback.  It will  also

inform  and explain to opinion makers and grassroots  leaders

the rationale and details of Government policies."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this different from what they have done before

and what they are doing now?  Why is the emphasis still on  a

downward  communication  to  opinion  makers  and  grassroots

leaders to explain to them why policies are as they are?   If

there   is   no  difference,  and  an  emphasis  on  downward

communication, how will this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>

status  quo  promote  the change towards  an  active  citizen

sector?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plans by the Ministry of Information and the Arts

are  similar  in this regard.  It talks about the  access  to

information and again this is obviously very important to  an

active people sector.  But there seems in their Addenda to be

more   concern  that  the  greater  and  easier   access   to

information  will impinge on economic, social  and  political

life.  While this is true and should be studied, I would have

hoped that there would be an equal study on enabling citizens

to  have  use  of greater access to become more knowledgeable

and  aware of important issues facing our society.  This will

be  the  necessary basis, the foundation, for more  informed,

reasoned and active people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn next to the Prime Minister's Office. I was

heartened  here to see a subsection of the Addendum  entitled

"Towards  Active  Citizenship", and by  the  pledge  in  this

Addendum  to  have the public service play its  part  towards

attaining  this  goal.  But the particulars of  the  Addendum

fall short, in my view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promise here is to "consult the private and public

sectors  more,  in  order  to  obtain  feedback,  tap   their

specialised  knowledge,  and [I  want  to  emphasise]  ensure

smoother implementation of Government's policies."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smoother implementation of Government's policies" is a

necessary  and  helpful step.  But it is not  enough  for  an

active  people.  Active citizens are not just there  to  help

Government policy implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it is worth pointing out that all of us

citizens  have at least three parts - hands, a  heart  and  a

head.     Government   wants   helping   hands.    Government

increasingly wants the hearts of Singaporeans too, if this is

to  be our home.  But it is less clear from the various plans

whether  Government also wants the head.  Not on  a  chopping

block.   But a head, a mind that can independently think  and

want  to propose or oppose policies, rather than just helping

smoother implementation. And with that head comes mouths that

can freely and reasonably speak.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Ministries have proposed is a start, but a very

modest  one at best.  The Singapore 21 Committee on the  idea

of  active  citizens went quite a bit further.   The  subject

committee which I chaired with Mr Lim Swee  Say, now Minister

of State, on "consensus and consultation against decisiveness

and  quick action" made a number of concrete suggestions that

have  yet  to  find  a  place  in the  Addenda  announced  by

Government.  I hope perhaps they will.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these points, I want to emphasise that I am

not arguing for free licence and a rowdy free-for-all.  Those

who  argue against a status quo can often be mischaracterised

in this way, and they find their proposals labelled "radical"

or "unrealistic".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach I am arguing for finds its analogy in the

liberalisation of the financial sector.  First, we must  have

a   broad  vision  of  what  the  Government  wants  and   an

identification  of  present  limits.   Second,  we   need   a

recognition  that  while Government will  have  a  regulatory

role,  that  role  has changed.  Third, we need  an  emerging

practice that shows all the practitioners concerned that  the

philosophy  and  tools  for regulation  have  changed.   And,

fourth,  we  need  a series of measures that  will  push  and

change the existing limits.  In financial liberalisation, the

Government's approach has been, I believe, for  a  series  of

"small   bangs".   Not  radical,  but  readily   discernible.

Measured but measurable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would call for a similar approach to the

liberalisation  of  our laws and policies towards  an  active

people sector.  And I am disappointed that I do not find such

a series of small bangs in the Ministerial Addenda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while I criticise, I certainly do not want to be

seen  as  an  armchair critic, or even a Parliamentary  chair

critic.   I  and  my  fellow  NMP, Zulkifli  Baharudin,  will

undertake a study on civil society in 21st century Singapore.

We will roll up our sleeves as an active citizen, do our part

to study this problem. The study will focus

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>

on  three areas: (1) the registration of societies;  (2)  the

limits to speech and assembly, especially in public; and  (3)

the  role  of private foundations and Government agencies  in

supporting and fostering civil society organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are, to us, three of the key limits and obstacles

to  a  more active people sector.  Mr Zulkifli and I  do  not

prejudge what the conclusions of the study will be.  In  each

area, while there is a need for more openness, there may also

be valid reasons for limits and obstacles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the first area, for example. The registration of

societies  is fundamental to having active citizens  organise

themselves.  If they do not register, they may be  considered

illegal and prosecuted.  Yet, it is within the discretion  of

the Registrar of Societies to refuse their registration on  a

number  of grounds.  So some cases take time.  In comparison,

the  registration of private companies is automatic and easy.

There  are historical reasons for this, and also some present

day  concerns.  We therefore have to more closely examine how

to  balance  the  needs, on the one hand, of  a  more  active

people   sector  to  organise  themselves  and  be   lawfully

registered and recognised, with, on the  other hand, the need

for caution and control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second area too of public speech, I think there

is  a need to examine the balance.  It cannot be, on the  one

hand,  that we allow speech without responsibility, and allow

for  sedition, racial slurs, defamation, mis-information  and

possible  disorder in the streets. But, on  the  other  hand,

should we continue to have all public speech, including  that

on  political  and  social issues, licensed  under  a  Public

Entertainment Act, and decided by some faceless  bureaucrats?

In  comparison,  our censorship of films  has,  in  the  last

decade, moved far beyond this already.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at this juncture, mention this debate about

having thick skin.  In my case, I think, it is more just  bad

skin which people mistake for thick skin.  I want to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>

point out that, of course, people who want to participate  in

public  debate  must have thick skin.  But  I  also  want  to

emphasise the question of whether, in this robust engagement,

it  is truly equal and truly fair.  The analogy I have, in  a

sense, is traffic.  We all drive.  You may have a car, I  may

have  a car.  Others drive in bigger cars and some of us  may

be  bus  drivers.  Buses today are big, fast,  turbo-charged.

Both cars and buses have honks.  I may sound my "horn", or to

use  Singlish, I may horn.  But if I am driving a car  and  I

honk, it does not mean that I will be able to engage the bus,

even  if it is in the wrong.  He is probably a wiser man  who

values his car, his life and that of his passengers who gives

way   to  the  bus.   I  think  this  analogy  needs  careful

consideration when we talk about debates between a fledgling,

young people sector with an established strong, knowledgeable

and determined Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the issues that we hope to consider in

our  study over the next few months and to seek a new balance

for.   But,  as  I  said, I do not prejudge our  conclusions.

What  I  can  tell you is our approach.  We will consult  and

canvass our initial thoughts with relevant actors, especially

those  in civil society and also those in relevant Government

agencies.  We will aim for consensus.  But that is not always

possible.  I think we should not water down our study to  the

lowest  common denominator.  Therefore, we will not shy  away

from controversy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to coach and also to criticise. We hope to

persuade  and debate and also press.  Those who do  not  have

power, who do not sit in the seat of power in Government, can

do no more.  But active citizens should do no less.

With this, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to join in the debate on the motion

to thank the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next millennium will be a different era from this

century.   Two  major  trends will have  a  major  impact  on

Singapore in the next century.  The socio-economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>

landscape  of  Singapore will be transformed by the  Internet

and  information technology revolution and the  small  modern

Singapore  family  will face the challenges  of  managing  an

increasingly aging population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on people development, active citizenship

and  development of heartware will take a different dimension

with  the  explosion  of the Internet, broadband  technology,

wireless  technology  and  other  developments  in   the   IT

revolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IT revolution will change the social and economic

landscape of the world.  As we prepare the younger generation

in  our educational institutions for the future, we must also

prepare  ourselves for the consequences of the IT  explosion,

especially the Internet.  The Internet will have far-reaching

implications for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Internet world, speed is everything, and the

extremely fast pace of development has opened an entirely new

social  and  economic virtual world that only  the  Internet-savvy  can  keep  pace  with.  Entirely new  businesses  have

sprouted out that have grown rapidly to challenge established

institutions.  Many virtual Internet companies are now  worth

more  than their competitors and are increasingly eating into

the  economic pie of the real world competitors.   Those  who

have  the vision to understand the power of the Internet  and

harness  its  power  will be leaders  in  the  next  economic

revolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-70s when this American Charles Schwab decided

to  transform  his  full-service brokerage  into  a  discount

brokerage firm, he insisted, against a trend, that  he  would

develop in-house technology.  He placed his bet on technology

and signed a cheque that was equal to the entire net worth of

his company.  By 1996 it had begun offering Web training.  In

January 1998, it weaved all its electronic services into  one

integrated  service.  Now, according to the IT research  firm

company, IDC, Charles Schwab & Company commands more than 70%

of the assets traded online, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>

its  trading  volume is that of its nearest three competitors

combined.  Worth US$36.5 billion, Charles Schwab & Company is

widely acknowledged as the only traditional retail operation,

financial services or otherwise, to have successfully adapted

its  business  to the Web.  Charles Schwab has become  bigger

than established financial institutions, like Merryl Lynch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success story is not only confined to USA. Despite

a  non-supportive environment in Japan, Mr Mikitani,  a  1988

graduate  in Japan, launched his Internet site in  1997,  and

since  then  he has developed Rakuten into the  most  popular

online  business-to-consumer e-commerce designation in Japan,

averaging approximately US$3.5 million in transactions  every

month  and  more than 400,000 visits per day.  He  said,  "In

Japan,  everyone  was  pessimistic about  e-commerce,  and  I

wanted  to do something that everyone was pessimistic about."

Two-and-a-half  years  later,  Rakuten  has  become   Japan's

largest on-line shopping mall, providing auction, hosting and

transaction-processing services and market-analysis tools  to

more than 750 of Japan's largest companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet will affect every industry. Interactive

video  on  demand,  music on the Internet and  the  broadband

revolution  are  shaking up the entertainment  industry.   No

business will be spared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore to be relevant in the next century, we

must  become a top class Internet and technological hub.   We

must have the right ingredients to succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential ingredient we have to add to ignite any

significant  revolutionary  development  in  the  information

technology industry is the entrepreneur or technopreneur.   A

rare  species,  they  are  imbued with  clear  vision,  great

foresight, utmost determination, inexhaustible drive, extreme

passion, immense resourcefulness and perhaps a foolhardy love

for  risk.   The spirit of the entrepreneurs exudes boundless

and  infective optimism that drives the belief that they  can

achieve the most wonderful things in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>

the  face of gargantuan obstacles.  For any market or economy

to  prosper, entrepreneuers are indispensable.  They are  the

agents of change.  As the economist Lester Thurow observes in

his   latest   book,   Building  Wealth,   "Change   requires

individuals who recognize that new things can be done and who

take  the  initiative  to get them  done.   .   The  existing

bureaucracies, public and private, will not take on  the  job

of changing what is."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bureaucracies will have to constantly modify the

rules to create a conducive environment that will ensure that

the  entrepreneur will thrive.  We have taken  some  concrete

measures  but  more needs to be done.  I have  been  told  by

companies  that have taken grants from NSTB that they  lament

about  the  bureaucracy.  Perhaps it is time  to  review  the

administration of such grants to IT companies to establish  a

comfortable balance between protecting the interest  of  NSTB

and the non-hindrance of company efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindsets have to be changed. The Internet will make the

world  a giant information hub.  Information cannot be hidden

as Internet allows us to harness the wealth of information on

the  Net.  For example, health and medical information  sites

in  the USA provide equal access to all users, regardless  of

whether  he  is  a medical doctor or a lay person.   However,

many  Singapore  sites tend to bar the lay  public  from  the

restricted  areas which are only accessible to professionals.

The  irony of it is that the same information, or even better

information,  is available on the US sites and accessible  to

the  lay public.  Singaporeans must learn to understand  that

the  Internet world is a borderless world.  Instead of hiding

information, we can play an important role in optimising  the

use   of  information  available.   We  can  help  Net  users

distinguish  the  good  sites from those  with  poor  quality

information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Singapore Government wants to fulfill its dream

of  becoming a world-class virtual hub, Government Ministries

and bodies must be bold enough to make the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>

changes that can help technopreneurs and entrepreneurs  blaze

their  way  into the realm of the Internet and stand  on  the

pedestal of success.  In this case, it is not a case of  more

speed, less haste; but rather more speed is the best pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the key elements of entrepreneurship and the

creation of the right milieu for Singapore to succeed in  the

new  era,  we  need  to  add  the element  of  a  trained  IT

workforce.   A  strong focus on IT in the educational  system

will  prepare a new generation for the IT era.   However,  we

must  not forget that there is also a significant segment  of

the  population that is not Internet-savvy.  I am  glad  that

the  PA  (People's Association), has stated that it wants  to

change its image.  The Community Clubs have the potential  to

become  a natural foci to start this Internet revolution  for

the  uninitiated, as it is visited by a wide spectrum of  our

society, be it men or women, young or old.  The virtual world

is  also  where the Singapore Government needs to engage  its

citizens.   If  we do not do so, we will have an increasingly

larger  segment  of Singaporeans spending more  time  in  the

virtual  world oblivious to the realities of the  real  world

Singapore.   The  virtual world will be  a  place  where  the

Singapore Government will find it more difficult to reach out

to the virtual citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Government Ministries must take the lead in

engaging Singaporeans in this virtual world and move  towards

having  websites  that  are  not  merely  static  information

portals  but truly interactive portals.  I must commend  HDB,

for  example, which has an extremely comprehensive site,  and

it  would be made complete if it was truly interactive and in

more than one language.  There is a very impressive list of e-mails  which you can actually send to the different  branches

and  even to the headquarters.  But feedback from people  who

have  seen me is that often you do not get much of  a  reply.

So I think if we want it to be a truly active and interactive

site and promote active citizenship, this is one step that we

have to take.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet revolution has provided Singapore with an

opportunity to become a top service and financial hub  centre

in  the world.  It will create an e-commerce entity that will

one  day  rival and perhaps even exceed the size of the  real

world economy.  We have to have the right recipe to succeed - we  have  the entrepreneurs, we have the people who  are  Web

trained;  what  we  need  now is a bureaucracy  that  is  Net

literate and perhaps even Net savvy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major issue that will have a major impact on

Singapore is the issue of an ageing population.  The  smaller

families  that  have  resulted from  our  earlier  successful

family  planning programmes have meant that each family  will

have   more  difficulty  in  supporting  the  elderly,   both

financially  and socially.  The small working  families,  for

example,  will find it extremely difficult to look after  the

elderly,  especially  if  any one  of  their  parents  has  a

disabling  disease, such as a stroke or in  a  terminally-ill

condition.   Hence,  I  support  the  move  to  increase  the

promotion  of  CDC as a social anchor in our community.   The

CDCs  must  be equipped with the infrastructure as they  take

upon  more responsibilities that were previously administered

by  the  different Government agencies.  The CDC will be  the

most  appropriate body to coordinate the provision of  social

services and facilities for the aged and be the link  between

the  Ministries and the voluntary welfare organisations.   It

should  be a one-stop centre for the coordination of services

for  the elderly.  The volunteers who help the CDCs and  VWOs

are  a  special  breed  of  people  and  though  they  do  it

selflessly, we must never take their effort for  granted.   I

think more must be done to recognise their effort and time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as we move into the next millennium, we have

to  recognise  these trends and act with more  speed  at  the

fastest  pace if we want to succeed in building a  successful

virtual  Singapore  that  is  as  successful,  if  not   more

successful, than the real world Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

President, in his Address to Parliament, has outlined several

new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>

and significant directives for the various Ministries.  These

directives  will  put Singapore in good  stead  for  the  new

millennium  and I therefore would like to support the  motion

of thanks to the President for his Address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sense of urgency amongst the many healthcare

providers  who  wish to see our healthcare system  make  even

more adequate and affordable and even more effective in terms

of  both cost and quality.  Ironically, it is not the lack of

activity  and  anxiety that bothers many.   It  is  the  very

vibrant and tremendous pace of change happening to the  whole

system that is worrying.  Sir, now is the time for us to look

at  our  future needs and I seek indulgence of this House  to

deliberate  on  this  today.  I would like  to  suggest  that

unless  we adopt a new mindset, there would not be any  scope

for  further significant improvements to our system when  the

new millennium unfolds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we planning adequately in accordance with the

requirements  of  the present and future  population  trends?

Have  we  enough  safeguards against the very  fast  changing

trends  in  medicine  and medical technology?   Are  we  bold

enough  to  discard  any remaining illogical  philosophy  and

historical  baggage?  Are we utilising and  coordinating  our

resources to the fullest?  I fear we do not have a resounding

"yes" to all these questions just yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our healthcare system is in a healthy state and

the  Government has done a very good job thus far, we are  in

no  position  to  rest on our laurels.   We  have  many  good

policies in place and we would do well to keep them.  We also

have  some policies that require re-evaluation so  as  to  be

either  improved  upon or removed from our forward  planning.

This  may involve fundamental changes in philosophy and  will

require  the Government to be open-minded and willing  to  do

the right thing when the right thing comes along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has done well in keeping our

healthcare cost at about 3% of our GDP for the past 10 years.

Considering that Government's expenditure was 0.9%

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>

of  GDP  last  year,  it  would be  seen  that  the  national

healthcare  expenditure  here  has  remained  relatively  low

compared  with other major industrialised countries.   It  is

remarkable  that,  this notwithstanding, the  Government  can

still  affirm  that  no Singaporean will  be  denied  of  any

medical  treatment due to the lack of means.   Singapore  has

engineered  and  given  sound foundations  to  the  Medisave,

MediShield   and  Medifund  schemes  as  means  of   ensuring

affordable   medical   healthcare.   By   improving   primary

healthcare affordability, controlling public hospital funding

and  regulating  private hospital charges for Medisave  users

through  a  "casemix" system, we expect  to  further  enhance

quality affordable healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do have the broad picture of what we

need  to ensure "good and cheap" healthcare.  What we do have

is  also the work ahead and the need for caution and care  in

our  approach.  In this respect, Sir, I would be well pleased

when the Ministry of Health could consider the suggestions  I

have on the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Capitalise fully on our "talent" pool of doctors.

There  should be a directive calling for better  use  of  our

medical  doctors and specialists.  Every year,  many  of  our

best brains in Singapore take up medicine.  We should have  a

lot  of  talent  amongst our medical  doctors.   The  maximum

potentials of many, especially those in the private practice,

have  not  been  harnessed.  The Ministry should  change  its

commonly  perceived  mindset of looking  at  the  doctors  in

public  and  private  sectors as two different  and  opposing

camps.  Sir, I would have thought that it would be better for

all  doctors to work together as one continuum.   They  would

all be better trying at all times to exchange new information

and  experience,  to  share  the workload  of  looking  after

subsidised  patients, to help train junior  doctors,  and  to

save  on heavy expenditure by maximising joint usage of those

expensive technology and equipment.  The mindset must  be  to

function as one force to further excel in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>

medicine,  to  work  as a team steering ourselves  to  better

heights  for  the  better  of all  patients  and  to  develop

Singapore into a "regional medical hub".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stumbling block here is the Government's

directive,  as set out in the 1993 White Paper,  to  rely  on

competition  and market forces to improve service  and  raise

efficiency.  This mindset has been entrenched in our  medical

sector for years, although it is a known fact that healthcare

is  an  instance of market failure.  It is not good when  the

public  sector  starts  having to compete  with  the  private

sector  and  it  is  worse when the  Ministry  of  Health  is

becoming  more  and more synonymous with the  public  sector.

Sir,  cooperation  rather  than competition  should  reap  us

better  results here and there is a need for all  parties  to

modify or change the existing philosophy.  The details on how

to  go about getting better use of all the medical doctors in

Singapore are another topic by itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Make full use of our resources. Mr Speaker, Sir,

all  our hospitals should complement rather than compete with

each  other.   Better  cooperation  between  hospitals  would

enable  us to maximise our own resources.  It would be better

if  there  is  no excessive re-duplication of  specialty  and

especially super specialty services.  It would also be better

to  allow  for  the  free  flow of medical  personnel,  where

applicable,  to  maximise the results  of  service.   At  the

moment, even public hospitals compete with each other.  Terms

like   'double  standards',  'competition',  'level   playing

fields',   'limited  use  of  Medisave'  and  the  like   are

frequently used nowadays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many restructured hospitals are under pressure to

perform well, especially in monetary "bottom-line" at the end

of  each  year.   If  that becomes the dominant  factor,  the

ensuing policies that the hospitals make will invariably take

on  pecuniary  inclinations.   Consider,  for  instance,  the

situation when hospitals remunerate doctors for the number of

patients they see.  Theoretically, the doctors might hold  on

to  a few more of those patients that could be discharged and

thereby increase

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>

their   patient-load.    The  resultant   effect   would   be

insufficient  time  being allocated  to  each  patient.   The

patients  would  be at a disadvantage because  the  excessive

numbers of patients would diminish the quality of care.  This

is  another  example of market failure at work.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the Ministry of Health must have directives that ensure

our  public hospitals are there to treat our sick and not  to

make money with Government subvention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Prioritise preventive healthcare. The directive on

preventive  healthcare should be put firmly  in  place.   The

various  Ministries involved should work in concert and  view

this  as a matter of priority.  The successful implementation

of preventive healthcare will translate into quality life for

our  people and with enormous savings for the people and  the

nation  on  healthcare  cost.  Sir, I  have  brought  up  and

discussed  this  important  issue at  an  Adjournment  motion

earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Plan for an ageing population. It is important for

us to adopt correct and effective policies in this area right

now so that we may cater for the diverse and varied needs  of

an  ageing population.  Done the right way, we will  also  be

cushioned  against increasing demands in future.  I  am  glad

that the President, in his Presidential Address, referred  to

the  recommendations  of the Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on

Ageing  Population and said, "We must start now to  implement

policies  and programmes to address these future needs."   Mr

Speaker, Sir, bear in mind that the ageing people will be the

main users of our medical healthcare, I would suggest that we

consider the following points:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Plan for more "cheaper to run" community hospitals

for the chronic sick.  We do not need more acute hospitals as

we do have more than enough of them at the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) We need to better postulate the needs of an ageing

population,  especially in terms of  the  number  of  nursing

homes,    dementia    homes,   geriatric   departments    and

geriatricians.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) We seriously consider the most effective way to

cater for the chronic sick in the future and that would be to

get  the  primary healthcare doctors to share  the  workload.

Sir,  I would like to declare, at this juncture, that I am  a

primary healthcare doctor.  Shared care and step-down care to

the  primary practitioners will certainly reduce the  use  of

acute  hospitals and community hospitals.  Moreover, patients

will  also benefit through staying at home and close to their

own families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) We increase the teaching of gerontology for all

medical  personnel  and  establish  geriatrics  as  a  worthy

specialty for younger doctors to pursue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Establish better distribution of subsidy. Directive

on  funding  should  be towards better  distribution  of  the

subsidy to those that are really in need.  We must make  sure

that  there  is no loophole in our system that  may  lead  to

abuse,   misuse  or  "buffet  syndrome".   Singaporeans   are

pragmatic  and  will  usually  not  "waste"  any  windows  of

opportunity   that  comes  to  hand.   Our  present   subsidy

guidelines are not the most rational because anyone  can  get

the maximum subsidy if he so chooses.  The Ministry of Health

does  not  apply any "means test" as compared to the Ministry

of   Community  Development  or  the  Ministry  of   National

Development.  New funding for the chronic sick for  long-term

healthcare  should  be  worked  out  as  soon  as   possible.

Perhaps,  we  should  look at utilising  a  Medisave-type  of

funding here.  A lot of work will be needed to establish  the

criteria on the use of funds for long-term healthcare as  in,

say, how primary healthcare providers could be remunerated in

a reasonable and controlled manner to ensure affordability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are fortunate here in Singapore. We

have  the  means to afford world-class medical care  for  our

people.   We have the personnel and premises to dispense  the

medical  excellence to our people.  We also have an abundance

of  ideas  and  means to turn this country  into  a  regional

medical  hub we allude to not infrequently.  So let  us  make

sure we get the best mileage from what we have.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of Mr

Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin with my speech, I must say a few words in

fairness  to our sage mentor Confucius.  On Monday, Mr  Chiam

See   Tong   said  that  the  philosophy  in   Singapore   is

authoritarianism  because  it is based  on  Confucianism.  He

could  not  have been more wrong.  Confucianism  advocates  a

benevolent government like what  the famous Tang poet  Du  Fu

described in one of his poems, "Build thousands of  homes  to

shelter   the   poor  and  make  them  happy."   Confucianism

emphasizes  "cultivating  the moral  characters  of  oneself,

putting  the family in good order" as a basis of the  people-focused  philosophy  in  ruling the  country.   Due  to  time

constraint  I am unable to spend time to explain the  details

to Mr Chiam in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite him a historical fact to prove him wrong.

Just  imagine, if Confucianism is authoritarianism, then  why

had the first Emperor of China, Qing Shi Huang, to bury alive

the  Confucian scholars and to burn the Confucian books?   Mr

Chiam's  one-sided evaluation of Confucism  and  the   NCMP's

lopsided criticism of the President's Speech reminded  me  of

the  story about a blind man describing the elephant, as told

to me by my teacher when I was a little boy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have some real-life examples

here.   When we discuss national issues and topics  affecting

the  daily lives of our people, we should first make some in-depth studies and research from a macro view.  We should  not

generalize and be lopsided in our assessment.  Otherwise,  we

will  be like the blind man who caught hold of the elephant's

trunk and said that the elephant was like a snake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Singapore's key competitive strengths is its

active  and effective practice of tripartism.  As one of  the

social  partners, the labour movement in Singapore  has  over

the   years,   strengthened  its  commitment  to   harmonious

industrial relations as well as raising productivity  at  the

workplace.   Our  unions understand that a  better  life  for

workers  and their families is only possible when investments

are forthcoming and good jobs are available.  To ensure this,

all  the  tripartite partners should continue to work closely

for  a  harmonious  industrial climate and industrial  peace.

So,  we have to help our workers acquire the requisite skills

to  meet  the  challenges that lie ahead and  give  them  the

relevant and proper knowledge and skills that we can continue

to remain competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the increasing global competition, jobs that

are  deemed the iron rice bowl may well become a thing of the

past.   This  kind of long-term job security does  not  exist

anymore.   Our goal is how to ensure life-long employability.

As the old Chinese saying goes, "as you live till an old age,

you  must keep on learning". This is even more true today  as

we move towards a knowledge-based economy. As Mr Matthias Yao

had  said,  our workers need a completely new set of  skills,

very  different  from those applicable to our early years  of

industrialisation.   Our  workers  must  continually  upgrade

their  skills  and knowledge so that they  will  be  able  to

perform better than others. It is only then that they will be

able  to operate computers and other advanced equipment.   We

need  workers to constantly make use of knowledge and perform

better.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent article in the Far Eastern Economic Review

observed  how  countries like Singapore had  scored  well  in

labour   rankings,  aided  more  by  factors  like  political

stability,  infrastructure  and telecommunications.   But  we

should  not be too quick to pop the champagne as the  article

went  on  to say and I quote, "And they (Singapore  and  Hong

Kong)  cease  to  be competitive in tasks such  as  technical

support and accounting.  Hong Kong and Singapore will need to

improve  general education levels to prepare their  workforce

for  more  sophisticated  white collar  jobs."   Indeed,  the

article  cited  a  study by the Political and  Economic  Risk

Consultancy (PERC) that Singapore fared poorly as far as  the

quality,   cost  and  availability  of  skilled  labour   are

concerned.  So companies that require large numbers of manual

workers will continue to be moved out of Singapore to cheaper

locations.  To stay employable, our people must have  a  good

grasp  of  the  core  skills. We must be  able  to  do  this,

otherwise  our workers will have to suffer from  unemployment

and hardship because of severe structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the knowledge-based economy, workers must have a

reasonable degree of skills and know-how.  If workers are not

up  to it, they will find it difficult to find jobs here  and

you cannot compete with others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, when we are facing the challenges of

the  21st  century,  we have to build up  our  heartware  and

social  cohesion so that we will not be phased out.  We  must

not  overlook  the consolidation and the maintenance  of  the

heartware.  I hope that the employers will cooperate with the

unions to provide a better and safer working environment   to

ensure that the employees enjoy good health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern computer may be attacked by virus and it

becomes paralysed.   Likewise, the workers' productivity  and

efficiency  may  be  affected by  illnesses  or  occupational

hazards  that  cause them to be unable to  work  effectively.

This is a matter which we must look into seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Survey 1998 showed that hypertension

has increased

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>

to  27%  of the population recently and for high cholesterol,

it  has  gone up to 24%.  Diabetes affected 9% of  the  adult

population.  The situation is more alarming among  the  older

people. Among those in their 50s or older, half of them  have

hypertension, 2 out of 3 have high cholesterol, and 1 in 5 is

diabetic.  For those in their 60s and above, it is even  more

alarming.   Over  3 in 5 have hypertension,  half  have  high

cholesterol and 1 in 3 is diabetic.  More than half  had  not

been  previously  diagnosed and this is also  very  alarming.

They  do  not  know  that  they are having  health  problems.

Another  area of concern is that 3 in 4 think that  Singapore

is a stressful place to live in.  Although a little stress is

good  for  motivation in work, chronic stress could  lead  to

serious health breakdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope to see more employers carrying

out  workplace  health programmes to help  the  workers  look

after  their health.  There is a need to set up a  structural

framework such as a simple annual health screening to  detect

health  risk  factors and medical problems among the  workers

early,  so  as  to prevent complications and  disability.   A

follow-up programme can then be established at workplaces  to

help  promote healthy lifestyle, encourage people to exercise

regularly,  and have regular health checks.  It  is  just  as

important that workers choose healthier diets, learn to  cope

with stress and say "no" to cigarettes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to further improve occupational safety and

health  at the workplace to minimise the number of industrial

accidents and incidence of occupational diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of offenders paying

composition fines for infringement of safety rules  increased

from  2,617 in 1997 to 3,218 in 1998.  Last year, 99  workers

died in industrial accidents, and 162 others were permanently

disabled.   There  were 897 confirmed occupational  diseases,

with  674  suffering  from noise-induced  deafness,  and  132

others  from  industrial  dermatitis.   Occupational  disease

cases with permanent disability for the last three

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>

years,  from  1996 to 1998, were 96.  Our workers  deserve  a

safer working environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthy living is as important as a safe working

environment.  Healthy workers are more productive.  Enhancing

the quality of life of workers is the primary objective of  a

trade  union.   Job creation, job security,  a  safe  working

environment and good wages will be meaningless if our workers

are unable to reap the benefits because of their poor health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the survival of Singapore depends, to a

large  extent, on our ability to continue to be  relevant  to

the  market place in the world.  This primarily rests on  the

skill  levels  of our workers.  But this alone  will  not  be

sufficient.    The skilled worker will be of no use  when  he

continues  to  be  on  medical leave or he  works  under  the

impending  dangers to his health and life at  the  workplace.

This  is  an awesome challenge that requires no less  than  a

full  commitment from the Government, the employers  and  the

unions  working hand in hand.  This is a very important  area

that  we  must look into.  So all the three partners  in  the

prosperity  of  Singapore  must  work  together  closely   to

implement  measures to ensure the safety of our workers,  how

to  safeguard  our  human resource as our  asset.   Sir,  our

workers are our very important asset and we have to face this

new challenge to enhance our work safety.

<div align="center"><b>DEBATE ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

excited by the programme of the Government which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>

focuses  on  people development.  The concrete plans  to  re-engineer the education system, upgrade worker skills,  caring

for  the  aged  and  the  disadvantaged,  and  preparing  the

population  for  the  IT age are indeed commendable.   It  is

something we can achieve, and achieve well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also commend the Government for being bold in

recognising the challenges that lie ahead for the nation  and

what it intends to do to meet it head on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am even more impressed by what it intends to do

in  the sphere of active citizenship.  The move to engage the

citizens in every sphere of Singapore life is laudable and is

progressing gradually and well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active citizenship is a concept that has to be

understood  well by all players.  Mr Davinder Singh,  in  his

opening address, has highlighted well that the people look to

the   Government   for  a  road  map  with  clear   pointers.

Similarly,  the  private  sector  is  also  looking  to   the

Government for these clear pointers.  Naturally, there is  an

assumption  that the Government has charted the  terrain  and

has marked it with clear pointers, but that such a map is not

available for public use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I reckon the truth is that the Government is also

moving  into  uncharted  terrain.  I think  my  parliamentary

colleague, Mr Davinder Singh, put it aptly when he said  that

even  at  the  top "we are still grappling for some  form  of

consensus  about  the  desirable pace  of  change."   So  the

reality may be that there is no road map, more so a road  map

with clear pointers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can there be a road map with clear pointers in real life

when  the  terrain  itself is not surveyed and  planted  with

markers?   We have to work together as pioneers to chart  the

terrain collectively  premised on a common purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to recognise that there are some things in life

that  one  cannot put down in detail.  Even a good  road  map

sometimes  does  not  point  the  hidden  danger  zones   and

potholes.  One has to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>

travel  the road to discover the road and the pitfalls there.

We may meet speed cameras, bumps, potholes, traffic policemen

and  other  impediments.  Different drivers  also  react  and

drive  differently according to temperament  and  experience.

We  become wiser and experienced.  We must also know that  if

one  takes great risk and drives dangerously, we can endanger

ourselves, our passengers and other road users.  It all boils

down to a call of judgment.  I hope my analogy highlights the

real  life situation.  In real life, everyone, including  the

Government, has to make a judgment call.  When, how  and  why

it will be made cannot be predicted as there are many factors

that will be at play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must also acknowledge that all this call for active

citizenship  will  come  to  a  dead  end  if  the  political

leadership is keen but the bureaucracy resists the  same  and

fears  encroachment and criticism.  Similarly, it would  fail

in  its infancy if the political leadership takes to task any

unconstructive disagreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the credit of the Government and the civil

service, they have accepted the need for active citizens  and

have  come  out with several steps to engage them  in  policy

making.  I can vouch for it because I have seen it in  action

in innumerable instances.  The bigger question is whether the

people really understand what is meant by active citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a pool of intellectuals in Singapore who

are   naturally  excited  and  are  looking  forward  to  the

blossoming  of  a  civil society.  Here, I must  caution  the

advocates  of  the civil society itself.  There  are  varying

definitions  of civil society among different theorists.   In

fact,  two scholars, Michael W. Foley and Bob Edwards,  wrote

an  article  in the Journal of Democracy, Vol. 7.3,  entitled

"The Paradox of Civil Society".  In their article, they state

(if I may summarise the gist) that some see civil society  as

a  state  where  non-government  organisations  spontaneously

appear to allow for participation and involvement by citizens

in  non-political  areas such as social clubs  and  volunteer

organisations.  They call it civil society

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>

model  1,  and  this  is their first definition.   Robert  D.

Putman  who  is  an advocate of this model states  that  such

associations must not be polarised and politicised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What these organisations attempt to do is that they

attempt  to bridge social and political divisions  and  thus,

presumably, are autonomous from political forces.  The  issue

then  arises:  how  can  such  associations  shape  political

participation  and  "civic engagement"  without  engaging  in

specifically   political  issues  and  without   representing

compelling  social interests?  Can these organisations  under

the  civil  society  model 1 really  meet  the  clamour  from

Singaporeans for greater participation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another group of theorists who advocate

that  the  civil  society becomes a check on undemocratic  or

tyrannical governments.  This version is articulated by Jacek

Kuron, Adam Michnik and others.  Clearly, they see their role

as  harbingers of democratic change and see their involvement

in politics as natural.  These theorists lay special emphasis

on civil society as a sphere of action that is independent of

the  state and that is capable of energising resistance to  a

tyrannical  regime.  This is the model seen in  the  past  in

many Latin American and Eastern European states.  And I would

call it the civil society model 2.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you can see, at the definition stage, there is a

degree of great difference between civil society model 1  and

model 2, for while the former postulates the positive effects

of  association  for  governance, the latter  emphasises  the

importance  of  civil association as a counterweight  to  the

state.    There  is  no  reason,  in  principle,   why   this

counterweight of civil society will not become a burden to  a

democracy or an authoritarian state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the two scholars, Michael W. Foley and Bob

Edwards,  in the same article "The Paradox of Civil  Society"

described that the "concept of civil society seems to take on

the  property of a gas, expanding or contracting to  fit  the

analytic space afforded it by each historical or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>

socio-political setting."  That is how elusive the concept of

civil society is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is clear is that the civil society model 1

does  not entail participants entering the sphere of politics

and challenging the state (or government) as a counterweight.

Those  who  insist  on  pushing  a  political  agenda  or  on

challenging the government of the day should then move on  to

the  arena  of  political organisations.   The civil  society

model 2, as it stands, cannot be acceptable in Singapore as a

counterweight to the Government, because we have a Government

that is democratically elected in elections every five years,

and  only they have the right of representing the people  and

of  making  key  decisions for the people.   However,  it  is

unclear  which  is  the  model  that  the  civil  society  of

Singapore will become.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the statement by the hon. NMPs, Mr Zulkifli

Baharudin  and  Mr Simon Tay, that they will  look  into  the

challenges  facing  civil society in  Singapore.   But  as  I

listened to the speech of Mr Simon Tay earlier, I noted  that

they  will  be addressing three issues:  (1) registration  of

societies;  (2) the limit of speeches; and (3)  the  role  of

government, private society and civil society.  What I  would

urge them to do is try, in the first place, to establish what

exactly  is  the  type  of  civil society  that  we  want  in

Singapore, because if they do not clarify right at the outset

what  is the type of civil society that we wish to create  in

Singapore,  looking at the two models that are  available,  I

think there is potential for conflict ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that it is no help to ask the Government to

define  the scope of participation for civil society  as,  by

its  nature, civil society must be spontaneous and autonomous

of  state.   Even  if  the Government  were  to  define  such

parameters as called by Mr Davinder Singh, would it not  then

be accused of setting OB markers and be accused of stifling a

greater   civil  society?   Similarly,  the  very  call   for

tolerance of constructive disagreement is a sine qua non  for

trouble, as the issue

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>

arises   who   defines   constructive,   or   its   corollary

destructive,  disagreement.   Naturally,  everyone  with  the

present  mindset will look to the Government  to  define  the

same.   But  then, would we not all come back to  square  one

where all is state defined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, just as much as Mr Simon Tay earlier called in

his  speech for a civil society, I noted that he called  upon

the  Feedback Unit to come back with measures on how  to  get

more   feedback,   and   also  how  the  various   Government

departments  had  failed in certain aspects.   Civil  society

naturally  must  also be involved and that there  must  be  a

spontaneous reaction from people to see how they can  improve

the society and the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was even more amused that in today's Straits

Times, Mr Zulkifli Baharudin has called (i) on the Government

to   help   finance  organisations  and  lend  administrative

support;  and  (ii) for civil servants and GLC  employees  to

become   involved  in  civic  groups.    This  is  in  itself

unacceptable  to the purists of the civil society  proponents

who  do  not want to see the hand of the Government in  civil

society.   Even if one were to accept Mr Zulkifli's call  for

help, would not the civil society then be accused of being  a

"guided civil society"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the full extent of the plea of Mr Zulkifli is

analysed, one would realise that we will be back to where  we

are   now.   We  already  have  a  "dense  network  of  civil

organisations"  which  is considered necessary  for  a  civil

society,  and  which is a key requirement for civil  society.

Perhaps  the  purists do not realise that in the real  world,

there  can be no civil society in a vacuum and that you  need

support, whether from government, political parties or  other

interest groups to survive, thrive and stay relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my wish that we create our own model civil

society  which  meets our requirements, our  aspirations  and

common purpose.  In the process, Sir, it is equally important

that  we  do not exclude the existing key components  of  our

society.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>

We  should  include the grassroots organisations, our  unions

and  many  other organisations which are present in Singapore

in  any civil society that we intend to create because  civil

society must mean participation by everybody in that society.

It is something for thought for everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call to all Singaporeans is that the Government is

ready  for  active citizenry.  The ball is  in  the  people's

court. They decide what is the appropriate model.  You may be

rebuked  unexpectedly.  You may be challenged vigorously  and

not too subtly, but change, particularly radical change, does

not come easily and we may have to work together to reach our

destination together.  One must never forget the key  message

in  the  President's  Address that the Government  wishes  to

engage  all its citizens in a constructive manner in  various

aspects of decision making and to get Singaporeans to play  a

greater constructive role in national life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have defined politics as a serious business in

Singapore.  If some Singaporeans see civil society as a cloak

to  make  good  populist speeches and not take responsibility

for  it,  then  my advice is, go join the Toastmasters'  Club

where  good speeches get commended.  But if there are serious

people  who  want to champion political issues  or  political

causes,  then  join political organisations and champion  the

cause or seek to become an NMP.  Let us all welcome this  new

dynamic  phase  of  national development,  ie,  building  the

heartware.  Let us all collectively survey the terrain,  mark

out  the  safe and unsafe areas and work together  in  making

Singapore our home the best home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>3.48 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

at  the  Opening  of the last Session of Parliament  in  June

1997,  I spoke on Singapore 21 and our vision for a new  era.

But  visions  must confront realities, and in case  our  feet

left the ground, I cautioned that there were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>

many things in the future we could not possibly foresee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month later, a financial crisis erupted in Thailand,

swept  across  Asia,  and devastated several  economies.   It

permanently  changed the strategic landscape in  the  region.

The  forces of change that the regional crisis unleashed  are

still at work, and we do not yet know their full impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who could have foreseen the traumatic changes in

Indonesia,  or  that Singapore, at the UN's  and  Indonesia's

invitation, is participating in the INTERFET mission in  East

Timor?  What will Indonesia be like after 20th October when a

new  President is chosen?  What will the region  be  like  in

five years' time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, technology and globalisation will continue

to   transform  businesses,  economic  structures  and  human

society.  We have to face intense economic competition in  an

increasingly  borderless  world, and  manage  change  in  our

society as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This volatility and uncertainty in our regional

environment  and  the rapidity of changes in  the  world  are

realities we have to live with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response should be strategic and robust. In

essence,  we  shall focus on our people, investing  in  them,

enhancing   their  capabilities,  stretching   their   minds,

stimulating  their creative and entrepreneurial  spirit,  and

harnessing  their  ideas and energy to  build  a  first-world

economy and a world-class home.  This is our bold strategy to

tackle the challenges ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A first-world economy and a world-class home are not two

separate  goals.  They are two sides of the  same  coin.   We

need the resources from a sound, competitive economy to build

a  world-class home, and we need a world-class home to anchor

Singaporeans to create a first-world economy for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the two facets, a first-world economy is the

easier  goal to achieve.  Our economic foundation  is  strong

and our reputation as a pro-business economy is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>

excellent.   By implementing the right policies  consistently

and building new capabilities, we will succeed in becoming  a

first-world economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a world-class home presents a trickier

challenge.   It  is  not  just  about  nice  houses,   modern

conveniences  and  bright city lights.  It is  about  people,

relationships,  motivation, commitment,  passion,  dedication

and  determination.   The irony is that  the  more  Singapore

improves  its infrastructure and amenities, the  less  unique

and   indistinguishable  from  other   cities   it   becomes.

Singapore   risks  becoming  like  one  of  those   well-run,

comfortable  international hotels which  successful  business

executives check in and out.



<br><br><i>Building a world-class home</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes a home different from a hotel is where the

heart is.  Most homes are less comfortable than a hotel,  but

they  are  where the people feel they belong, where they  are

king  and  where they can decorate and arrange the  furniture

anyway they like.  This, in essence, is what distinguishes  a

home  from  a hotel.  Singapore is a place where Singaporeans

can  be  themselves, where they can make  a  difference,  and

where they care for one another and rally together when faced

with  challenges.  The best home for Singaporeans is a world-class home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I want to highlight two demographic trends which

may undermine our effort to build our world-class home.



<br><br><i>Falling fertility rates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first trend concerns the growth of the population.

The  statistics  show  clearly  that  we  are  not  replacing

ourselves.   This is a serious problem.  The  Government  has

warned  against this trend 12 years ago.  We tried to reverse

it but we have not been successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Total Fertility Rate or TFR has fallen steadily

since  1990,  despite our scrapping the "Stop At Two"  policy

and encouraging

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>

married  couples to "Have three or more, if  you  can  afford

it".   The  TFR is a fertility indicator which shows  whether

the   population  is  replacing  itself.   A  population   is

considered to be replacing itself if it can maintain a TFR of

about  two.   This means a woman in our population  would  on

average  have  two  children in her lifetime.   Our  TFR  has

fallen steadily from 1.87 in 1990 to 1.5 in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1998 was the Year of the Tiger so one would not expect a

large  number of births.  But the Year of the Rabbit has  not

been  prolific  either.  The number of births  in  the  first

eight  months  is, in fact, 3% lower than that  of  the  same

period last year.  Unless the Rabbit surprises us in the next

three months, the TFR for 1999 is likely to fall below 1.5.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987 when I announced the Government's New Population

Policy,  I  also expressed the hope that there  would  be  at

least 50,000 births a year.  This provides the minimum cohort

size  to  sustain  our economy, defence  and  other  manpower

needs.  Our actual birth numbers were nowhere near the 50,000

mark  in the past five years.  In 1998, the number of  births

came  to  only  43,664,  far short of  the  target  that  the

Government set.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this declining fertility trend persists, and it is

likely  to  be  the  case, our citizen  population  of  three

million will grow to about 3.5 million by 2030 and then start

to  decline.   Ang Mong Seng and Dr Michael  Lim  raised  the

needs of the old.  The needs of the old will become even more

acute  after 2030.  The proportion of older people then  will

be  far higher compared to what it is today.  There will also

be  fewer  people in the working-age group.  This means  that

the  3.5  million people in Singapore in 2030 may not produce

sufficient  wealth to look after the needs  of  the  old  and

society  in  general.  Can a shrinking population  sustain  a

first-world economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics also show that the more educated mothers

are,  the  fewer  kids they are likely  to  have.   The  more

educated  have  on average a family size that  is  about  15%

smaller  than those with lower education.  As the educational

standard of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>

our  people will go up, we must expect our TFR to  fall  even

further.   There  are many reasons for the  declining  TFR  - urbanisation, education, changing lifestyles, singlehood  and

late  marriages.  Having babies also involve personal choices

and  trade-offs.  I am not optimistic that we can  achieve  a

significant increase in fertility level.  But we  must  never

give  up trying to get Singaporeans who can afford it to have

more  children.  Dr Jennifer Lee talked about incentives  for

fathers.   I  am  not sure paternity leave  is  the  solution

because  our  main  problem is the large  number  of  highly-educated  women  who remain single.  Among those  with  post-secondary qualifications, about one  in five women is  likely

to  remain  single  in her life time.   So  we  must  try  to

increase  the  marriage rate of our women,  especially  those

with higher education.



<br><br><i>Adopting an "inclusive" mindset</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that our citizen population is not replacing

itself,  we have no choice but to top up our population  with

new  immigrants.   They provide a much-needed  boost  to  our

manpower  strength, augmenting shortfalls in  the  productive

age groups and increasing our talent pool.  Since we have  to

take  in  new  immigrants, we should be selective,  admitting

only  those  with  skills, high education and  talents,  from

wherever  they  are.  This way, we make sure that  foreigners

who  become  Permanent  Residents  and  Singaporeans  are   a

definite   plus   to   our   country.    These   foreign-born

Singaporeans will help enhance the vibrancy and  dynamism  of

our economy and society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should make every effort to absorb these foreign-born

Singaporeans  into our society.  We should  strengthen  their

commitment  by giving them a sense of ownership of  Singapore

too.   This  inclusive approach will ensure that a generation

from  now, these new Singaporeans and their children will  be

as  nationalistic as any one of us.  Their children will have

to do national service as Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Singaporeans Overseas</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second trend - the increased

number  of Singaporeans going overseas.  I asked the Ministry

of Manpower how many Singaporeans are overseas on a long-term

basis.   The  Ministry came up with an estimate  of  150,000,

which included working adults and their dependants, emigrants

and students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the number of Good Conduct Certificates issued

by  the  Police,  each year some 2,000 Singaporeans  pack  up

their bags and emigrate.  More than half are females, many of

whom  married  foreigners and leave Singapore to  join  their

husbands.   There are also some 6,000 applications to  MINDEF

each  year  for  reservist training deferment on  grounds  of

overseas employment of duration longer than six months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we like it or not, more Singaporeans will take

wing,  given the pace of globalisation and their own personal

mobility.  As Singaporeans become even more cosmopolitan, the

issue  of  concern  to us is whether they  will  become  less

rooted  to  Singapore.  We now have to even compete  for  the

hearts of Singaporeans against attractions elsewhere.



<br><br><i>Developing each and every Singaporean</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this background, you will appreciate better the

significance  of  the statement - every Singaporean  matters.

There  are not many of us to build and protect our home.   So

we  have to provide every Singaporean with the opportunity to

develop  his  or her potential to the fullest.  We  have  cut

down our school dropout rate.  So it shocked me to learn that

each  year  some 1,500 children, or 3% of a cohort,  are  not

even  registered  for Primary One in national  schools.   The

Ministry of Education has argued against compulsory education

because  the number of non-registration is considered  small.

But  every Singaporean matters.  And every Singaporean  child

should  be  given the same head start in life, ie, to  attend

school.  I favour compulsory education,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>

at least up to Primary 4 level.  Beyond that, if a child does

not  want to study, or wants to drop out, there is little  we

can  do.   I am asking the Ministry of Education to  consider

the introduction of compulsory education.



<br><br><i>Giving Singaporeans an emotional stake</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have given Singaporeans a physical stake in the

country - home-ownership, upgrading of HDB estates, shares of

privatised Government companies, cash top-up of their CPF and

Medisave  accounts, good infrastructure and ample  facilities

for sports and leisure activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now give Singaporeans an emotional stake in the

country.    This   is  why  I  have  made  consultation   and

participation one of the Government's major goals.  It is  to

give  Singaporeans a bigger say in their own future, and thus

bond them to Singapore.  We want Singaporeans to sprout ideas

to make Singapore better, take responsibility for their ideas

and make them work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has successfully tapped private sector

expertise  for major Government-led committees  such  as  the

Committee  on  Singapore's Competitiveness of  1997  and  the

Financial  Sector  Review Committee of 1998.   We  found  the

private  sector  involvement very useful, both  in  terms  of

coming  to  grips with the problem and of forging a consensus

on  the way forward.  We will continue to involve the private

sector  in  major review of important policies, not  just  in

economics, but also in non-economic areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have systematically opened up more

channels  for  citizens to participate, to  involve  them  in

building  a world-class home.  Besides writing to the  press,

Singaporeans  can  channel their views through  the  Feedback

Unit,  Service Improvement Unit, Institute of Policy Studies,

Members of Parliament, dialogue sessions, GPC resource panels

and so on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recently-completed Singapore 21 exercise was

noteworthy for its involvement of Singaporeans from all walks

of  life, in particular, younger Singaporeans.  Their  vision

and  recommendations are now accepted as  national  policies.

Due  to such extensive and active participation, we were able

to  come  up with a Singapore 21 vision which fully reflected

the  needs and aspirations of our people.  The opposition may

dismiss Singapore 21 as empty elections talk.  The point  is,

it   is  a  collective  product  of  Singaporeans,  and   the

opposition has nothing fresh to offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Tay expressed his disappointment that the

President's  Address  and Addenda fell short  on  details  on

fostering  an  active citizenry.  If the Government  were  to

spell  out each and every step, or a series of bangs,  as  he

put it, then it is contrary to what active citizenship is all

about and what we are trying to do, that is, more initiatives

from the people sector.  Ravindran has answered this question

very well - that you want spontaneity from the people sector.

What Simon Tay and Zulkifli are doing is right, that is, do a

study  on  how to foster civil society and submit it  to  the

Government, and then we take it from there.  This is  what  I

mean  by active citizenry.  You take the initiative, and  not

expect  the Government to outline the steps all the  way  for

you.

<br><br><i>Turning Singapore into a nation of ideas</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, thousands of Singaporeans submit their

suggestions and views to the Feedback Unit.  In 1997, we took

the  feedback process further by organising regular  feedback

contributors  into groups.  So far, 27 feedback  groups  have

been  formed.   These feedback units are the people  sector's

equivalent of Quality Circles and Work Improvement Teams.  We

now  want  to go beyond feedback on how policies  affect  the

people  to  encouraging Singaporeans to  submit  constructive

suggestions and new ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Civil Service, we reward Work Improvement Teams

when they submit cost-saving ideas.  Singaporeans may wish to

form themselves into similar work

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>

improvement   teams  to  submit  ideas  on  any   aspect   of

government.   We  will  introduce an  award  scheme  to  give

symbolic recognition for useful ideas put up by Singaporeans,

either  individually or as a team.  Big ideas or small ideas,

let them flow.  Turn Singapore into a nation of ideas.



<br><br><i>Consultation and Participation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me explain what I expect of consultation and

participation, to avoid misunderstanding and cynicism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, consultation does not mean that every Singaporean

must  be  consulted, or that every policy discussed with  the

public before it is implemented.  That is not practical.   If

it  were  practical, you would not need Members of Parliament

or  representative government.  Parliamentary democracy means

electing  a  group of Members of Parliament to represent  the

people's  interests.   The  Government  consults  the  people

mainly through their MPs, and is answerable to Parliament for

its  performance.   That  is why  having  good  MPs  who  can

understand the concerns and solve problems for the people  is

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when the Government consults, it is with people

who  have good knowledge of the subject.  It consults  people

who  can help improve the formulation of policies.  It is not

necessarily  with people who may be affected by  the  policy.

Every  policy of the Government affects the whole population.

No government consults its citizens on every policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Singaporeans must not expect every suggestion and

idea of theirs to be accepted.  If a proposal is well argued,

it  will get a fair hearing.  Even if it is rejected,  it  is

also  valuable if it has challenged existing assumptions  and

thinking  and provided the opportunity for the Government  to

reaffirm its policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, while Singaporeans will have more space for

political  debate,  it does not mean that the  Government  is

vacating the arena.  Anyone who wants a policy changed, or to

set the national agenda,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>

must  expect a debate with the Government.  Every  Government

policy  has  been carefully considered before implementation.

But  anyone is free to challenge it.  However, he must expect

a  response from the Government.  The Government will  defend

its  policies, principles and programmes openly and robustly.

Not  to  do  so  is contrary to the whole purpose  of  public

debate.  If the Government remains silent, views contrary  to

what  the  Government believes is right, will  soon  prevail.

This will confuse the ground because the public may think the

Government, by its silence, agrees with the contrary views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zulkifli Baharudin said that "being thick-skinned must

certainly  be one of the necessary pre-requisites for  anyone

intending  to engage in public debate".  No, we do  not  want

Singaporeans to develop hides.  Even the thickest hide can be

stripped.   We do not want a querulous population with  thick

skins.   An  important pre-requisite for public debate  is  a

keen  mind  -  how sound an idea is, and how it will  benefit

public interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that those without mischievous intention or a

hidden agenda need not fear a rebuttal from Government.  They

should   not  be  discouraged  to  speak  up  simply  because

Government may challenge their views.  Constructive debate is

a  necessary part of the process for determining what is best

for  Singapore.  This is what consultation and  participation

is about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those out to undermine the Government, or to wrest

power  from  the ruling party, is another matter  altogether.

They  must  expect a political response from the  Government.

This  political  response  can be  extremely  robust  because

whoever wins in the political arena will decide the future of

Singapore.   The PAP will guard its turf jealously,  not  for

itself, but for the good of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will always be like a boat shooting the

rapids.   Those  who  have  done  white-water  rafting  would

understand  my analogy.  They will understand the  importance

of the steersman as the boat

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>

negotiates  the rocks in a fast-flowing, frothy  river.   The

Government is like this steersman or captain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have experienced the thrills and dangers of white-water rafting in New Zealand. Once in the boat, I put my

faith  in  the  captain  and  do  what  he  told  me  to  do.

Consultation took place before I stepped into the boat.  Once

I was in, I had to play my part as a member of the crew.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think that Singapore is sailing in calm waters

and  therefore we can take risks.  Or that we  are  freer  to

rock  the  boat because we now have a sturdier boat and  each

one of us is equipped with a safety helmet and a life jacket.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political landscape of our neighbours is changing.

It  will affect the strategic and security environment of our

region.   And  however  well-governed Singapore  is,  however

strong our economy is, and however united our people are,  we

will  be reminded from time to time that we are a little  red

dot, or an adik, or a predominantly Chinese country within  a

Muslim region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean we have to have a siege mentality.

It  means  we must be robust, forward-thinking and innovative

to  break out of the confines of our geography, which is  why

we  are changing the way we teach in schools, and getting our

people to be more resourceful, creative and better informed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revamp of the education system will lead in the

future to a questioning electorate.  A questioning electorate

and   population  will  demand  a  higher  performance   from

Parliament and the Government.  It will demand more political

space, more debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will such a population throw up an alternative party to

challenge  the  PAP, or will it throw up more  good  men  and

women  to join or support the PAP and help it carry  on  with

its work?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it matter so long as it produces a group of leaders

who are honest,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>

committed  to  Singapore  and more  competent  than  the  PAP

leaders?   Does  it  matter  if  it  is  a  population  which

understands  Singapore's uniqueness and  vulnerabilities  and

backs its leaders?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do know that to survive in an intensely

competitive borderless and volatile world, it does matter  if

we  do  not  have  a  well-informed,  thinking,  resourceful,

innovative and cohesive population with the resolve  to  keep

Singapore going.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why for the remaining term of this Parliament,

we  are  emphasising  people - numbers, quality,  commitment,

relationships, roots, responsibility, freedom,  participation

and  passion.  But more than talking and consultation,  there

must  be  action.   This is where I salute the  thousands  of

social workers, volunteers, grassroots leaders and others who

do  more than talk.  They go about quietly, looking after the

interests  of their community and fellow Singaporeans.   They

are  a  critical  part of our people sector.  The  Government

values such people.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, especially the younger generation, must

believe  firmly in what Singapore stands for  -  our  ideals,

ethos, principles and values, and be willing to do their part

to  safeguard our way of life.  They have done well  in  life

because  the  Singapore system offers them  a  level  playing

field,  abundant opportunities, and a helping hand to develop

their  potential to the fullest.  Singapore's  future  is  in

their hands.  They have to make a difference to Singapore and

make  us  proud  to  be Singaporeans.  This  is  what  active

citizenry is about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our hearts beat together for Singapore, we will

succeed  as  a  nation no matter what challenges  lie  ahead.

[Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

rise  in  full-hearted support of this motion and  thank  the

President for his timely pronouncement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>

that  people will be the focus of the Government's policy  in

the new millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been so much debate, just a few minutes

ago  with  PM's  discourse  and in  the  last  two  years  on

Singapore 21, in particular on how the State must create more

opportunities  for  every  citizen to  contribute  ideas  and

actions to be active citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has implicitly accepted, I presume, that

the relationship between the State and society need not be  a

"flight  or fight" choice for Singaporeans.  In other  words,

Singaporeans  who are critical of certain policies  need  not

either  totally  disengage  -  take  "flight"  so  to  speak,

physically  through  migration  or  psychologically   through

"tuning  out" - from public discourse, or "fight"  by  taking

part  in  partisan  politics.  If they do not  want  to  take

"flight" or "fight", is there a third way?  I would  like  to

think  so  because I clearly do not believe that the  options

before  us are dichotomous: that active citizenship is  about

whether you join the Government or against it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, in the last two years, has been far more

respectful  of different viewpoints and took them  seriously.

A  process  of  engagement between the State and  the  people

sector,  however unclear it is still in terms of  rights  and

responsibilities,  has  begun.  Nevertheless,  we  are  still

struggling  and  will continue to do so with  regard  to  the

amount  of  space  the  Government is prepared  to  give  its

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to cite for discussion the case of

Chinese  High  students who organised a  spontaneous  signing

petition   to   request  their  Principal  to  consider   his

retirement,  which,  to  me, was  a  seemingly  peaceful  and

heartfelt gesture that was absent of any ill intention.   The

Ministry made a public statement that students must stay  off

staff matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the Ministry's concern that well-meaning and

idealistic  students may be made use of  for  purposes  which

students only vaguely understood.  But, Sir, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>

future  references, who, how and by what standards  shall  we

judge  when  to  put  a curb on student's civic  involvement?

Should   we,   as   adults,   let   them   take   their   own

responsibilities  as  thinking  individuals,  by  adopting  a

greater  latitude of tolerance, even for acts which they  did

not  always  understand completely?  Sir, children  learn  by

making  mistakes in doing things.  While this may be  frowned

upon  in  our society, in our strive to create a zero  defect

and  zero  mistake society, we have to accept that  it  is  a

natural human limitation to make mistakes.  That being so, is

it  not  then  the  responsibility  of  the  adults  and  the

authorities to create that climate of tolerance for  learning

purposes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one student alumni from Chinese High said to me,

"if  we  do not first learn to bond with the school  and  our

Principal,  how can we learn to bond with the  nation?"   The

Chinese High students appreciated what the Principal had done

for the school and wanted him to stay, an emotion that seemed

natural  enough.   They would have liked  to  hear  from  the

Ministry  that this was a good thing to do too.  The Ministry

made  them  feel as though they could not act  on  their  own

without being easily manipulated.  Although the Ministry  did

say  it  was  understandable for students  to  express  their

feelings  in  a  press release issued by  Mrs  Lim  Soon  Tze

afterwards, the students nevertheless felt let down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are talking about future leaders of Singapore.

We  expect them to think and make mistakes.  Even if they had

been influenced by the Board members whose involvement in the

management  of  the  school  was inappropriate,  we  have  to

respect the students for reaching a decision to do what  they

did.  Then it is our job to persuade them otherwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I bring this up as a concerned mother because apart

from  academic achievement, I would like my children  to  get

leadership   experiences   from  their   schools   on   civic

responsibilities.  But I would also be disturbed  if  I  feel

that  they were being used.  In this particular case,  I  ask

what rights were the students asking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>

for?  Nothing for themselves, it was simply an expression  of

affection and hope that the Ministry will help them to retain

their Principal.  What was the responsibility which they must

reciprocate   to get this right of expression,  if  we  agree

with  Mr  Davinder Singh that there cannot be greater  rights

without  greater responsibilities?  I assume in this case  is

to  conduct  the act in a peaceful manner, without disruption

to  school  routine and order.  That they had done  too.   So

what did the students do wrong?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If students do not care about anything, they are accused

of being apathetic.  If they express strong feelings about  a

subject  which, one has to admit, they certainly  have  first

hand  feelings about, and act, as PM encourages people should

do  so,  they  are accused of being gullible  and  naive  and

manipulated  by  others.  Is this not  the  classic  catch-22

situation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not wiser then to consider a leadership style of

stepping back a little and "letting it be" (remember the song

"Let it be" in the words of a famous baby-boomer rock singer)

-  a  strategy of diffusing conflict and gaining some headway

in  a  difficult situation?  In Chinese, we say "yi  tui  wei

jin" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Is it not better that

a  separate  session  be spent with the entire  Chinese  High

School to commend the students for what they have done,  then

explain  clearly  but gently that this is  an  administrative

matter  which  is  best  settled  officially?   I  think  the

students will totally agree with you because most of them did

not  see their act as intervening in staff matters, even less

a  "wish  to join the picket line of employment disputes"  as

feared by Mr Loh Meng See.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry may be right to chastise the Board members

who  should  know  better, but it must handle  the  students'

emotions separately by attempting to earn their understanding

through  facilitative  communication  and  persuasion.   Such

openness  from  the Ministry including a little  risk  taking

initiative  on  its  part will go a  long  way  in  nurturing

teenagers to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>

becoming  self-empowered adults.  We  do  not  learn  lateral

thinking  by doing De Bono classes; it is by doing activities

with people and learning from all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that active citizenship encapsulates a

bargain,  but in any bargain, it involves two way risk-taking

and  resolution  process  being adopted  by  the  parties  in

negotiation.  If only one party dictates the terms, it is not

a  bargain;  it is an authoritarian imposition.   I  hope  Mr

Simon  Tay  and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin will use  the  case  of

Chinese High School as their study on civil society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a separate encouraging note, in my own experiences as

an   advocate  in  the  community,  I  have  been  given  the

opportunity  to  persuade policy makers and be  persuaded  to

give  feedback  to  certain Ministries and be  corrected  and

educated in return.  I have to register my gratitude here  to

the  Ministries of Community Development and Home Affairs for

opening  their doors to me and the groups which I represented

in  these  10 years.  In our constructive engagement process,

we  have collaborated on many projects together.  I hope  all

the  Ministries will continue to open up more, to  a  broader

range  of  people in small group meetings to  gather  diverse

viewpoints, or even radically different ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process of engaging the people sector is clearly

what  I  am  focusing  on, because in  the  process,  we  are

constructing  the  norms  and values  on  how  to  do  things

together and how to negotiate differences.  Mr Ravindran  has

eloquently  talked  about  what civil  society  is  not,  how

elusive  it  is  and the dangers ahead.  It  is  an  evolving

process  of definition.  I do not think Mr Simon  Tay  or  Mr

Zulkifli  Baharudin  will  find  the  definition.   It  is  a

collective process that we all here in this House must reach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply ask at this point for an engagement. In this

engagement, we learn to give and take.  We learn what can  be

negotiated  and attempted.  If no resolution can be  reached,

we  learn  how  to put the matter at hand aside  for  further

review and wait for another round of discussion,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>

always with an open mind and willingness to give the issue  a

fresh  look.   Never  mind  in the end  whose  proposals  got

accepted,   rejected  or  amended  -  the   time   spent   in

constructive  engagement  is  the  humanising  dimension   of

participatory  democracy.   If the Government  only  consults

those people who can help it formulate policy, ie, the highly

educated individuals, then it will fail to reach and feel the

community.  Civil servants, MPs and community leaders must do

their  part.  And I hope all Members of Parliament will  take

this seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The road map with clear pointers and markers" asked by

Mr  Davinder Singh cannot be established overnight.  I  agree

with  Prof.  Toh See Kiat that disagreement is not  division.

But  when  there are disagreements, it is important  that  we

keep  an  open mind to review the issues and reach  a  middle

ground.  Too many disagreements will lead to division.   With

sufficient   time  and  opportunity  given  to   relationship

building between the Government and society, we are closer to

knowing  how  "to  take the heat" as Mr  Davinder  said,  and

identify what Singaporeans truly want which cannot be assumed

to  be homogenous, as Mr Sin Boon Ann cautioned.  The process

of  engagement does help, I believe, to restore the emotional

bonding  that  Mr Inderjit Singh hopes for, the  loyalty  and

patriotism  that Mr Kenneth Chen wishes for in  Singaporeans,

and  the  trust  that Mr Zainul Abidin finds essential  in  a

pluralistic society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people have to act, not just pontificate or

ponder  like what Mr Iswaran said.  I would quickly add  that

the  Government too has to roll up its sleeves and  act  with

the   people.   It  is  evidently  in  the  interest  of  the

Government to say "Trust me".  But it has to meet the  demand

of  the voters who yell "Show me."  Between this tension,  it

is a whole lot of effort and sincerity that must be poured in

from  the  State and the people sector.  It is easy  to  shut

people  up  with  robust sanctions, but what  do  we  get  in

return?    Demoralisation,   indifference,   escapism,    low

voluntarism, low motivation - all the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>

attributes  which  kill creativity.  Thick-skinnedness  is  a

necessary trait.  I agree with Mr Zulkifli Baharudin, but let

us  not  forget that the skin gets thicker only with age  and

experience, not everyone gets there yet.  It is up  to  those

in authority to step back sometimes and let it be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the space to express and create, we slowly kill

people's  imagination.   Let me quote  what  Albert  Einstein

said:  "In  moments  of  crisis,  only  imagination  is  more

valuable  than knowledge."  Has the Government  provided  the

people  with an environment to imagine and create, to  better

face up to any crisis in the unpredictable times ahead, which

PM just a few minutes ago warned us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, permit me to switch gear and look at broader

issues.  The Government has said that developing heartware in

our society is top priority.  Arising from this commitment, I

propose greater attention to four areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The need for a broader definition of success beyond

just  material criteria so that we can tap the  diversity  of

talents  within our people.  To begin with, I would like  all

schools  and  all  learning institutions to develop  a  wider

range  of  curriculum components to cater  to  students  with

different  intelligence and talents.  The  future  demands  a

multi-disciplinary  approach  to  problem-solving,  the  more

flexibility  there is in subject mix as well as teaching  and

learning  methodologies, the more prepared  Singapore  is  in

producing  the kind of adults who are dynamic and  adaptable.

I  am  glad to hear from the Minister for Education yesterday

that  his  Ministry  is  reviewing the teaching  methods  and

teachers' quality at the pre-school level and I am so glad to

hear PM's call earlier for compulsory education up to Primary

4   level.   I  believe  that  learning  challenges  at   the

secondary, primary and pre-school levels are very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The need to address the social divide between those

who  possess the competencies and connections to make  it  in

the   knowledge-based  economy  and  those  who  cannot,   by

increasing the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>

awareness  of  the "haves" regarding the needs of  the  "have

nots".   I  attended  a seminar organised  by  the  AMP  last

weekend.  They  highlighted rising social  problems,  divorce

rates, increasing family violence, increasing teenage crimes,

high  drug  recidivism, low morale and motivation  among  the

disadvantaged families. These are not the issues of  a  Malay

community alone. These concern all of us as Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Zainul Abidin who said in his speech

that we cannot take multi-culturalism for granted, and it  is

no  longer sufficient for different ethnic groups to just co-exist.  We  need  to  enhance their mutual understanding  and

trust  for one another, not by institutionalising one  Multi-Cultural  Day,  but more by getting different  groups  to  do

projects  and programmes together.  And here, I am responding

to the call to act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose a buddy programme in schools to encourage

cross-cultural  interaction by pairing  up  different  ethnic

groups  to study together, even stay with one another  for  a

few  days.   At  another  level,  we  can  also  think  about

"shadowing"  programmes  for schools to  encourage  different

ethnic groups to pair up and shadow a CEO or manager at  work

in  the public and private sectors for one week, three  days,

or  even  one  day.  I had volunteered our company  for  this

programme initiated by Raffles Girls' Secondary School.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that such a programme helps to restore in our

young  a  certain  degree  of realism  about  work,  and  the

importance  of  teamwork and mutual support, all  the  values

which  are extremely important in cross-cultural relationship

building.   I  am  confident that this programme  would  reap

positive benefits in the case of teenage boys "at the  edge",

whose   restlessness   could  steer  them   towards   deviant

activities if unharnessed, but could yield productive outcome

if captured and properly channelled.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just a few examples for me to illustrate

the  need  for  new  ways  of motivating  our  teenagers  and

enhancing cross-cultural understanding. We cannot talk  about

racial  harmony.   We  must actively work  at  it  with  good

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the need to create a separate, distinct Youth 21

programme  similar  to  the S21 programme,  so  that  we  can

specifically  tackle  the  hopes  and  fears  of  our   young

generation.  The under-25 generation today will dominate  the

new  millennium.  If they feel bored, irrelevant and  trapped

in  their own homeland, Singapore will be the poorer for  it.

If  they  migrate,  we  are in a worse  shape.   As  PM  said

earlier,  we  are not replacing ourselves, therefore  keeping

every Singaporean is a priority concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose more resources to be given to the National

Youth   Council  and  community  agencies  to  create  "youth

centres", as Dr Tan Boon Wan talked about yesterday,  to  let

them meet regularly and identify clearly what teenagers want,

what  we  can do to meet these expectations and  how  we  can

shape their community responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the need to look at family values and

increasing  gender conflicts, and restore a sense  of  family

equilibrium that we have lost in the last few decades in  our

incessant  search for material wealth, at both  the  personal

and  national level.  In the larger perspective, families are

still strong, but it serves us well to find out why the bonds

are weakening, how women and men can be helped in coping with

their  changing roles and where the fault lines are  and  why

1,000 women left Singapore and married foreigners.  This is a

serious problem for the sons of the MPs in this House today!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the discussion of the impact of a knowledge-based

economy  on  society, what new policies can  be  designed  to

enable  families,  not  just workers,  to  become  "knowledge

families",  able  to  transmit the kind  of  information  and

values to the children to make them learn well and willing to

serve  the community with pride. I support Dr Jennifer  Lee's

call

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>

for   identifying  more  pro-family  work  policies  and  job

redesigns  to  help  working couples in  balancing  work  and

family responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end with an endorsement of the view

that  we  need more centres of prestige to be created  within

our  society.  More functions should feature guests-of-honour

who  are  not  Ministers and MPs, but other  leaders  of  our

community  in  their chosen fields.  I feel  this  effort  in

creating  horizontal connections of influence to include  not

just  politicians and civil servants, but credible  champions

in  the  people  sector,  be it in the  industry,  the  arts,

education,  social services, and so forth, will  add  healthy

diversity and new leadership to public events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers have said that they intend to support

this  by  covering  not just ministerial functions,  but  all

kinds   of   people  functions,  even  if  no   Minister   is

officiating. This is a good start of powering people to be on

the  front-line  to lead and influence.  May I  even  propose

that  one of the two newspapers that SPH is going to  publish

be   called   the  "The  Unofficial  News"  and  contain   no

pronouncements from officialdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to power the imagination, the idealism and

the hopes of all Singaporeans.  If the Government delivers  a

leadership  style  with the same measure  of  creativity  and

innovation which it expects of Singaporeans, we are closer to

building  the  people  power  for  a  better  millennium  for

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members before me have spoken on the

President's  Speech, touching on the Government's  commitment

to the Singapore 21 Vision and its focus and at this juncture

of  this  debate, I would just like to touch on those aspects

of  the President's Speech which serve to focus our minds  on

many post-crisis concerns of today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country, we have withstood the economic crisis of

the  past  two years which was described as one of  our  most

severe  economic  tests since independence and  are  emerging

relatively  unscathed in general compared to other  countries

in  the  region.  But before we give ourselves a pat  on  the

back,  congratulate each other for a job well-done and become

complacent in believing that what needs to be done  has  been

done,  we  should  examine how the crisis  has  affected  the

different segments of our population and how we are  handling

the challenges ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should ask ourselves whether the same measures that

we  took  to survive the crisis have weakened or will  weaken

our  social  fabric and our social cohesion in the long-term,

and  if so, what must be done to avoid such consequence.  How

the impact of the economic crisis is felt differs from people

to  people, person to person, family to family. For some,  it

was  just  like sitting through a horror movie.  Although  it

was  frightening  while  it lasted, they  were  watching  the

events  as if from a distance, as an observer.  And now  that

it is behind us, they let out a sigh of relief and say, "Boy,

that  was  scary.  Good thing we were not that badly affected

and emerged basically intact."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monetary value of their property, their shares and

their  assets is now back to pre-crisis levels and they  have

managed to maintain their source and level of income.   There

is  no  denying that the last two years were valuable lessons

but  they are history now and we move on.  But there are also

many  others among us who have literally lost their pants  in

the  crisis.   They  lost  their jobs,  ran  up  huge  debts,

compelled to sell their assets, their homes were foresold and

some  were  even made bankrupt. Even today, when the  general

consensus is that the economy is picking up, mortgagee  sales

of private homes are still happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people went through the crisis differently and

are  now  assessing their future from different perspectives.

I  felt  this  when  I  told my constituents  the  crisis  is

receding and we are emerging stronger

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>

than before.  They were not unanimous in agreement. Some  did

not  agree  wholeheartedly with this observation because  the

crisis  and the structural changes and restructuring that  it

brought  about had impacted them adversely and in a  profound

manner, and they are now worse off than before.  This  crisis

has  brought about many fundamental structural changes to our

economy.  Certain skills that were valuable in the  past  are

now  no  longer  needed.  Some of the  old  wealth  has  been

eroded,  even dissipated, while new wealth has been  created.

If you are not careful, this will result in a widening of the

disparity  between at the one end, those who are  well-placed

to  tap  into  and  take  advantage of the  new  restructured

economic  environment and, at the other end,  those  who  are

still  struggling  to  find their feet and  whose  skills  no

longer command the same value as they are being offered by  a

multitude  of others who are prepared to accept lower  wages.

If  this  issue  is not effectively dealt with,  there  is  a

danger  that those who feel deprived and left out will become

alienated  and resentful.  I am therefore heartened  to  hear

the  President's  note of caution that the  new  restructured

economy must not widen the gap between those who sprint ahead

with  the  new technologies and those who struggle to  master

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government has all along pursued policies to

enhance the cohesion of our society where even while the able

is called upon to lead in the growth of the economy, the rest

of  the  population is not deprived of the  rewards  but  has

enjoyed  a share in our economic growth.  Since independence,

Singapore  has achieved remarkable success. For  decades,  we

have  sustained one of the fastest growing economies  in  the

world,  while  maintaining  low  inflation,  virtually   full

employment  since 1973, and a steady rise in real income  and

standard  of living of Singaporeans as a whole.  Unlike  some

developing countries, this overall increase in income has not

been  confined to a privileged minority but is enjoyed  by  a

broad section of the population.  Over the years,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>

there  has  been a reduction of poverty and income disparity.

This  is  because we have not pursued policies favouring  the

rich at the expense of the middle and lower classes.  No  one

should  accuse  our Government of doing little  to  help  the

lower income group get out of the rut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principles that we have adopted to

organise  our  society have helped to  ensure  that  any  gap

between  the  various  segments of the  population  does  not

become unmanageable.  Many people would agree that the gap at

present  is small.  I found a recent example of this  in  the

reaction   and   our   Prime   Minister   using   the   terms

"cosmopolitans" and "heartlanders". Many people  I  spoke  to

felt  that there was not a clear distinction between the  two

groups.    They  felt  that  they  could  quite   easily   be

cosmopolitan at times and a heartlander at other times.   But

that  is  in  terms of outward behaviour.   While  our  Prime

Minister  spoke about the difference in outlook,  orientation

and   interests,  nevertheless,  in  Singapore,   a   typical

cosmopolitan can be very comfortable, behaving outwardly as a

heartlander  at  times,  and  doing  things  heartlanders  do

because  of the deliberate efforts of the Government  over  a

long period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, many of our Government programmes

have  brought  along  a  narrowing  of  the  differences   in

standards  of  living  and quality of life  in  the  material

sense. For example, our campaigns to keep Singapore clean, to

flush  the  toilets,  to be courteous and  campaigns  against

spitting and smoking have caused a change in the behaviour of

people  over  time.   And the norm is being  established  and

accepted  by Singaporeans in general.  This has narrowed  any

differences  in behaviour and averted a situation  where  one

social  group  finds  the behaviour of another  social  group

despicable.   So,  most  hawker  centres  today  are  of   an

acceptable standard.  But if this were not the case,  and  if

hawker  centres are dirty and rat-infested,  and many  people

there  spit  on  the floor, some people would probably  avoid

such  places  because they do not fit  into  the  idea  of  a

desirable place to enjoy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>

a  meal.  This would then lead to a divide among Singaporeans

based on where they frequent to take their meals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our public housing and social amenities, the

standards have improved and the gap in the material sense  is

not  wide.  Amenities  built to  cater  to  the  public  have

improved in standard and even the rich do not shun them.  Our

NTUC  supermarkets, wet markets, hawker centres, and national

parks  are  frequented  by people from  all  walks  of  life.

Cosmopolitans are not shy to say that they do so.  This is an

encouraging  sign  and we must continue  in  our  efforts  to

narrow  any gap in the quality of these facilities,  so  that

they  do  not  just  cater  to a particular  segment  of  the

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basic principles are in place and without

abandoning them, I believe more can be done in each of  these

areas  to gel the people together to enhance social cohesion.

With  a  cohesive people supporting the Government   and  its

policies,  we can confront and tackle problems  head  on  and

pull  everyone  together to focus on the challenges  and  the

possibilities that are ahead of us.  However, any measure  to

distribute  income more evenly must not stifle the  drive  to

excel,  but  must be balanced with other needs  of  retaining

talent  and  promoting economic growth.  We must continue  to

maintain  the  meritocratic society  of  equal  opportunities

while,  at  the  same time, working together  to  narrow  any

economic   disparity   among  the   different   segments   of

Singaporeans.  In the process, we can cultivate  a  sense  of

belonging  and identity that is firmly grounded and resilient

to weather any turbulence ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank you for allowing me to participate in the debate.

I rise to support the motion put forth by Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional crisis has demonstrated yet again how

precarious Singapore, the island state, is in this developing

region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>

Yes,  we are an independent nation, but totally dependent  on

the   health  and  the  well-being  of  the  region  and  the

international  community  for  us  to  continue   to   be   a

significant global player.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always demonstrated its wits and tenacity

in  building  up  its  attractiveness as a  premier  business

centre   in   Asia   with   a  global   orientation.    Rapid

globalisation,  advancement in technology and  communications

now mean that we have to adapt our strategies to fit into the

new world order or be left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the various Ministries' recognition of meeting

the  global  challenge  by taking  the  bull  by  the  horns.

However,  in  the  quest to achieve and maintain  Singapore's

edge as a premier Asian global city, we must ensure that  the

Singaporean  entrepreneurs  and  businessmen  are  not   left

behind.   Just  as  Singapore  has  grown  from  strength  to

strength,  the  small and medium local enterprises  of  today

could   be  the  multi-nationals  of  tomorrow.   As   global

companies  locating  in  Singapore compete  for  the  limited

resources we have, in particular the people resource, we must

ensure  that  Singapore  deliberately  supports  such   local

enterprises  and  ventures through  more  liberal  programmes

like,  for  instance, funding assistance,  start-up  and  R&D

grants, training grants and maybe even a lower corporate  tax

rate for such subsidies to be reinvested in the business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a host of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives

for  multi-nationals to avail themselves.  I understand  that

the qualifying rules are stringent to attract the appropriate

players in the high growth and high value added areas,  which

will  enhance  Singapore's competitive  edge.   However,  the

local SMEs should be identified as a group on its own with an

appropriate development programme.  I am totally  in  support

of  the Ministry of Trade and Industry's intention to nurture

a  hundred  promising local enterprises to become world-class

companies by 2005.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of foreign talent, let me say that I

am in broad agreement with the argument that in order to keep

our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>

competitive  edge,  Singapore has to supplement  our  limited

talent  pool  by  attracting suitably skilled  and  qualified

foreign  talent.  In this respect, I commend the Ministry  of

Manpower's  plans  to make Singapore an international  talent

city  and intellectual focal point where diverse talents from

all over the world congregate and supplement our own talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this policy is very much in keeping with

the   process  of  globalisation  sweeping  the  world.   The

communications  and  information  technology  revolution   in

tandem  with  the  emergence of a single global  economy  has

produced a new cosmopolitanism which is impossible to ignore.

Today,  it  is not unusual to find a Taiwanese, for instance,

studying  in the United States, then find a job in Hong  Kong

where he meets and marries a Canadian Chinese partner.   Even

closer  to home, when you watch CNN, it is impossible not  to

be  struck by the fact that the Asian presenters are speaking

in American accented English.  In other words, the concept of

a   pure   unadulterated   national  identity   is   becoming

increasingly  untenable, given the impact of global  economic

and  perhaps  even  cultural integration.  Singaporeans  must

thus  accept  that we are increasingly global  citizens,  and

that   to  succeed  in  an  increasingly  sophisticated   and

competitive  world, we need to be open to the idea  that  our

friends  from  overseas  can and must  play  a  role  in  the

process.  In short, we should see them not as foreigners  but

rather  as  fellow  global citizens who  have  joined  us  in

helping  us keep an international edge.  In fact, to  further

enhance our competitive edge, I would like to suggest that we

also  try to tap into the other rather neglected talent pool,

the Singaporean professionals who have emigrated overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a large community of what I would like to

call  quasi  foreign  talent available  whose  resources  and

skills  would  be  invaluable  to  our  economy.   The  Prime

Minister has alluded to this group of Singaporeans and  given

us  some  statistics.  From experience, I know that  many  of

these expatriate Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>

and  former Singaporeans would like to return home  but  they

are  dissuaded by the fact that they would have  to  give  up

their  present overseas standard of living and cope with  the

Singapore reality of high property and car prices, as well as

in  their  perception, whether true or  not  is  an  entirely

separate  matter,  the  more regulated social  and  political

environment.  However, if these former Singaporeans could  be

persuaded  to  return,  their impact would  be  considerable.

For,  let  us  face  the facts, unlike foreigners  who  would

probably  work  for, say, five years before  returning  home,

these  former Singaporeans, after all, grew up here and their

roots  are  here.  Their loyalty would be to  Singapore.   Of

course, there will be those who argue that the very fact that

they   left  Singapore  in  the  first  place  is  proof   of

disloyalty, but that is a very parochial point of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an open global economy, talent migrates to where

it  can  earn  the  greatest returns.  Singapore,  which  has

always   believed  in  the  logic  of  free  and   unfettered

competition,  recognises this.  Thus, the Singapore  way  has

never  been to brow beat our people into engaging in  certain

behaviour by loading them with guilt, but rather to  convince

them that it is in their interest that it makes perfect sense

for them to adopt that particular pattern of behaviour.  This

hard  edge realism is precisely why we pay our civil servants

good  and competitive salaries, and why our civil service  is

consequently   world   famous   for   its   proficiency   and

incorruptibility.  In this respect, if Singapore can  provide

these  quasi  foreign talents sufficient incentives,  whether

material or otherwise, and support and encouragement, we will

indeed be hard to beat and will become an intellectual  focal

point  which  will be irresistible to our sons and  daughters

who  are  now  overseas.   I wonder whether  the  Government,

through  its contacts with Singapore offices world-wide,  has

any  plans  to try to attract this particular pool of  talent

home where they belong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, I note that the Ministry of Community

Development  has  projected that the ageing  population  will

triple by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>

2030  when  one in four citizens will be aged above  65.   In

this  connection,  I  am  happy with the  several  Government

initiatives  to  cope  with this development.   I  note  with

approval   that   MCD  is  to  strengthen  public   education

programmes  on  ageing  and,  in particular,  will  encourage

Singaporeans  to  value  their  elderly  as  a  resource  and

actively harness their contributions.  I look forward to  the

MCD's  masterplan for services to the elderly which  will  be

ready next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also applaud the Ministry of Health for recognising

the   increasingly  urgent  need  for  step-down  care,   and

especially  its  intention  to work  with  voluntary  welfare

organisations  and  the  private sector  to  build  community

hospitals  and nursing homes.  I fully agree with the  future

policy  to introduce an insurance scheme to defray  the  high

cost  of long-term step-down care for the elderly who  suffer

from disabilities.  And I think the idea of a means test  for

all  step-down care services to allocate Government subsidies

for deserving cases is a sound one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased with the recent report that existing

MRT  stations will be retrofitted with lifts and  ramps,  and

the  North East Line and the Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit

System will also incorporate these elderly friendly features,

and that the Government will pay for this to be done.  But  I

believe  that more can be done to meet the specific needs  of

the  elderly,  eg,  will SMRT be willing,  for  instance,  to

designate one carriage as an elderly only carriage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MRT aside, how will public buses be configured to

facilitate  usage by elderly folk, especially those  who  are

disabled?  The Minister for National Development, Mr Mah  Bow

Tan,  has said that bus operators will be left to decide  how

to  make their buses more accessible to the old.  But bearing

in   mind   that   they  are,  in  essence,   profit   driven

organisations, how likely are they to put the convenience and

welfare of the elderly as a major concern?  Moreover,  is  it

possible  to  introduce a system as in the UK  where  elderly

people  travel  on  public buses for free,  rather  than  the

partial subsidy and limited travel

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>

arrangement?   Sir,  I do hope that the  Ministry  will  give

sufficient thought to these issues, especially if the elderly

proportion of the commuting public increases and in the light

of vehicle ownership policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Ministry of Manpower is looking into

fine-tuning  the CPF system to ensure members  have  adequate

savings  to  meet old age needs and medical  care.   I  agree

wholeheartedly  with  this review, as  CPF  funds  should  be

invested  wisely  and  not whittled away through  speculative

trades on the stock market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our elderly should be encouraged to retire with savings

and dignity.  In this respect, I would like the Government to

consider   reinstating  the  tax  exemption  for   retirement

gratuities,  as  was the case pre-1993.  This once-a-lifetime

tax  exemption  would further provide for adequate  financial

security on retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the self-employed, I would also like to see

compulsory tax free CPF contributions beyond Medisave,  which

would  equate at least to the gross percentage which salaried

employees are accumulating in their CPF accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the issue of catering to the needs of

the  elderly,  I would like to stress the importance  of  the

people  factor,  part of the heartware we want  to  build  in

ensuring that the various schemes succeed in bringing about a

population which ages graciously.  By the people factor, I am

referring  to  the attitudes of service providers  like,  for

example, bus and taxi drivers.  How many bus drivers actually

wait  for  the elderly to see them safely before moving  off?

And  very few taxi drivers actually help passengers  to  load

and  unload  their shopping or luggage.  Will they constantly

go  the extra mile as a rule of thumb for the elderly?  I was

also  appalled to hear how a 90-year old lady in a wheelchair

had problems getting to a hospital and clinic appointment, as

very  few  taxi  drivers  are keen to ferry  the  wheel-chair

bound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that these are issues which have come up time

and again, but unless

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>

we  consciously change these attitudes they will not go away,

and  even  the  best  infrastructure will  not  make  us  the

gracious society we want to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to make a few comments on

education.   I  believe that the MOE's emphasis  on  ability-driven education is the right one.  It is important to ensure

that  the  innate  talents and abilities of  each  particular

child  are identified, honed and harnessed not only  for  his

own  optimal  personal development but also for higher  ends.

In  this respect, I commend MOE's focus on the five areas  of

the school environment  -  the curriculum development system,

teacher  development, pre- and post-school  development,  and

developing Singapore as an education hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus particularly on curriculum and

assessment.  I note with approval that MOE intends  to  teach

our   young   to   think  creatively  and   apply   knowledge

innovatively.  I also note that to this end, MOE  intends  to

revise   the   curriculum  to  infuse  thinking  skills   and

incorporate  the  use  of IT in the design  and  delivery  of

syllabuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that every child would learn in an IT-enriched school environment over the next several years. I

fully  understand the rationale for integrating IT  into  the

very  fabric  of our curriculum.  Information  technology  is

transforming  the  world  we live  in,  and  to  be  computer

literate  is  today a basic prerequisite for success  in  the

global  economy.  However, I am not entirely  convinced  that

fostering IT savvy young people is synonymous with breeding a

creative and thinking young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, computer literacy is very important but it must

never  supplant  books as a child's best friend.   I  believe

that  in our quest to create an IT savvy next generation,  we

must  not lose sight of the truth that true creativity  comes

not  from  five  hours of surfing on the  Internet  but  from

reading  and appreciating the classics of the past.   Reading

good books forces the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>

mind to visualise and to imagine the basic skills of creative

thinking.  I thus would argue that in tandem with the  effort

to promote computer literacy, MOE should also promote a basic

reading  programme to encourage the habit of reading  amongst

our young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of good books can be drawn which would comprise

the classics, which every young person should read as part of

his   intellectual,  aesthetic  and  cultural  education  and

stimulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, starting this reading programme at a late primary

school  level would ensure that by the time our  young  reach

university  and  branch  out  into  the  hard  sciences   and

engineering disciplines, in particular, they would  at  least

have  had  some  exposure  to good  literature.   Hence,  the

opportunity to enhance their imaginative and creative skills.

This policy would ensure that it is not only students in  the

arts  and  humanities who benefit from world literature.   In

short, what we need to foster creativity amongst our young is

not  so much computer literacy, but a true literacy in  every

sense  of the word.  In other words, the habit and even  love

of reading must be inculcated in our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>

<b>Wong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to just

take  a  short while to respond to Mdm Claire Chiang's points

about Chinese High School.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was a little aware of her thinking on the

matter,  I was taken by surprise by the strong stand and  the

emphatic way in which she described the matter, especially in

the  context  of civil society.  In the case of the  students

who are in their teen years, they still need strong guidance.

It  is not exactly a very good example to use, just from this

issue  alone,  and say that we should be sympathetic  to  the

students because we are talking about civil society and  this

is the kind of emotions that we want people to express.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Chinese High School, I also felt, at

the beginning, that there was nothing wrong with the students

expressing  their  sentiments towards their  school  and  the

principal, who has done a marvellous job for the school.   As

Mdm  Claire  Chiang said, the students themselves also  think

that  they have done nothing wrong.  They have only expressed

their  tremendous attachment to the school and the principal.

But  Mdm  Claire Chaing also said that, as a parent  herself,

she may be worried that these young people may get themselves

into  a  situation  where they could  easily  be  misled  and

perhaps even made use of.  Actually this is the way that  MOE

has  looked at it.  MOE's view is that there is nothing wrong

with  the  students expressing their sentiments  towards  the

school  and the principal.  But it was inappropriate for  the

students  to be drawn into management matters where  already,

at  that point of time, the board of directors of the company

that  owns  the  school  was  no longer  in  control  of  the

management  of the school.  The management of the school  was

already  in the hands of the Committee of Management of  MOE.

So  it was inappropriate for the students to be drawn into  a

matter  which  relates to the management of the school  under

the influence of the board of directors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I knew more about the details, that there was in

fact  a press conference called by the Chairman of the  board

of  directors and the students were present, my reaction  was

very  different.  I said that this was wrong.   The  students

should not have allowed themselves to be drawn into a dispute

that involved a board of directors that had already gone into

dispute with the school.  My worry at that time was: are  the

students  sure what they are doing?  Do they really know  the

complexities  of  the situation and whether all  the  factors

have been made clear to them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I also felt that it was inappropriate for the

board  of  directors to draw in the students.   Things  could

have  been resolved within the school.  If the principal  and

vice-principals of the school had explained  clearly  to  the

students their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>

decision  to  resign  -  and in fact it was  known  that  the

principal  had  wanted to retire and he  had  handed  in  his

letter in August, and the Committee of Management of MOE  had

asked  him to stay on until the end of the year, but he  said

no  and that he had decided to retire early -  he could  have

managed  the  situation better and the whole thing  could  be

resolved.  So the Chinese High School incident should not  be

made  into such a big thing to become an illustration of  how

civil society should be like.  That is really stretching  the

matter a bit too much.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I agree with the Senior

Minister  of  State, Dr Wong, with what she said  that  board

matters  should  not be the concern of students.   If  I  had

sounded emphatic (here I am trying to lower my tone just now)

it   is  because  I  spoke  with passion  when  dealing  with

teenagers.  I must declare my interest here.  My son  who  is

17  years  old  is  from Hwa Chong.  He is therefore  an  ex-student  of Chinese High School.  Therefore, I am in  contact

with  the  Chinese High School students who shared this  with

me,  for which reason I therefore brought this up as  a  case

for discussion, not to illustrate the extent of civil society

per  se, but to look at the permissions that can be given  to

14-16  years  old to act.  That was the spirit with  which  I

brought this case illustration to this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree that they do need strong guidance. But,

as I said, I belong to a school of thought that also believes

that  people should be left alone to learn on their own.   If

you  are  holding their hands all the time, they  will  never

learn  independently.  This is a judgment call.  We  are  all

trained  differently and think differently.   That  is  where

maybe  the  constructive disagreement that Mr Davinder  Singh

said  comes about.  From constructive disagreement,  we  have

not  reached a point of consensus which should be weighed  to

help  us  in  this  constructive engagement to  discuss  this

further  and  perhaps look for some constructive  resolution.

This is an evolving process and I hope that the Ministry does

not  take  this as a blaming session but to take this  as  an

opportunity

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>

for us to think it through one way or the other and debate in

the true sense of the word.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, as a parent myself, if my

son had been involved in this kind of incident in this manner

and  he told me afterwards, my advice would be: "You be  very

careful  the  next time.  You do not know what  is  going  on

behind all the complications of the dispute and so on.  Don't

be  used  by  anybody.   There  is  nothing  wrong  with  you

expressing  your feelings, but there are also other  ways  of

expressing."   But if my son had consulted me beforehand  and

asked,  "Should I go and be involved?" I would say,  "You  be

careful and do not get involved.  You can also write  a  nice

letter to your principal and say how much you appreciate  him

and you really wish he did not make the decision to resign."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out to the House that the Chinese High

School  has been having problems over the last two  or  three

years.   It  is  not  unknown.  There are problems  with  the

management  in terms of the style, methods and so  on.   This

has  affected the standing of the school in the eyes  of  the

public.  Does Mdm Claire Chiang really want students also  to

get involved and complicate matters?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Point of clarification. My

son  was not involved in the signing petition.  He is an  ex-student.   The signing petition is only done by  the  student

council of Chinese High School and all that the students  did

was  to  express their affection.  My son and the  Ex-student

Alumni  signed  another letter of gratitude and  appreciation

for the teachers.  So it is a separate matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mother, and maybe a different mother, I will not

approach  the  subject with fear of constantly  reminding  my

children  about  what will happen to them.   If  we  act  and

conduct our lives in fear, how can we ever teach our children

the  determination, courage, and creativity that we are  also

hoping for?  I think there are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>

different  mothering  styles  and  we  should  respect  their

differences too.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> We are not here to discuss different

mothering  styles.   I think how you advise the  children  to

carry on in life, to deal with matters rationally, to look at

various  sides of the matter and to teach your child to  know

the  facts  before  he  jumps, to  me,  that  is  responsible

motherhood.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, with due respect, she

has not told me what did the students do wrong.  What was  so

wrong  in  what  they  have done in  signing  a  petition  of

appreciation?  What are the pitfalls that I have to warn them

against?  What are the problems?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> There is nothing wrong with expressing

their  affection for their principal or teacher.   But  MOE's

point  is  that  it is inappropriate for the students  to  be

drawn in by the board of directors which is having problems.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

speak  in  support  of  the motion by Mr  Davinder  Singh  to

express  a motion of thanks to the President for the  Address

he has given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the election of President S R Nathan in which he

himself has expressed that he is in his twilight years, he is

an example to our workers that they are never too old to take

on new tasks or to learn new skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with our manpower in Singapore, two

changes   that   will  certainly  affect  our  workers   more

concretely  are  the  faster pace of globalisation  of  human

resources at one time and the ageing of our workforce.   Both

processes  will influence the contact between  employers  and

workers  and thus affect the credibility of our aged  workers

to  continue  working.  We have seen the trend  from  various

sectors   affecting   our   workers   regardless   of    age.

Unfortunately, this trend will affect more the older  workers

aged 40 years and above.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are not concerned with the young workers

or  future  workers who are now studying who  will  gain  the

skills because the opportunity for them to be employable  for

life  is  being  nurtured now.  The  problem  is  with  older

workers  aged  40 years and above who are without  the  basic

skills even though they may have the experience.  This  issue

has  been  raised  by  many  parties,  including  Members  of

Parliament,  in these three days of debate.  But   I  believe

this has to be emphasised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have dramatic stories to tell but I hope that

our  workers  will grab all opportunities that they  have  to

enhance their skills so that they will remain employable  for

their  own  interest.  In the midst of the economic  downturn

early  this year, I met a worker who was retrenched after  16

years  because  his  company  transferred  its  manufacturing

operations  to Batam.  He saw me after four months  of  being

unemployed  and seemed concerned.  He said that half  of  his

compensation  of  $16,000 which he  received  would  be  gone

within  a  matter of months if he did not find an alternative

job.  The money was compensation of half a month's salary for

every  year  of  service as a production  supervisor  in  the

company.    Fortunately, he found an  alternative  job  as  a

maintenance  supervisor, but I was  concerned  that  such  an

alternative  job would also not remain for long  if  his  new

employer    restructures   his   operations   and   practises

outsourcing.  The irony was that the constituent had an NTC-3

qualification 16 years ago.  The qualification is  no  longer

relevant  in  other  factories, especially  in  view  of  the

competition from younger workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, while we should help the workers who need to

find  alternative jobs, what is more important is how we  can

widen  this  assistance to ensure that our  workers  who  are

vulnerable  to  retrenchment  can  have  their  employability

enhanced through retraining and skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on a number of visits to the Skills Development

Centre in Bukit Merah, I find that our workers who have  lost

their  jobs  and  who  have undergone skills  training  there

generally have a positive attitude

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>

towards   skills  upgrading.   They  realise  the  need   for

technical  skills.  Government and employers should encourage

and   open  more  opportunities  for  workers  such   as   my

constituent,  to  enhance  their skills  through  the  Skills

Redevelopment Programme (SRP) for workers in service, so that

they  can remain employable.   But no less important  is  the

need  for the Government to open many more opportunities  for

workers  who  have  lost their jobs to gain  skills  training

through the facilitated programme under the SRP.  The type of

courses  offered must also be widened.  As for  companies,  I

hope  that they will employ more retrenched workers who  have

been  retrained so that they can be independent  and  support

their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major problem may arise if these retrained workers

find  difficulty  in getting jobs just because  employers  or

future  employers pay very little attention to older workers.

Mr  Speaker,  this is a form of investment.   Just  like  any

other investment, there must be returns.  Our workers must at

least  respond  seriously to opportunities offered  in  their

interest.   Indeed, I believe that workers should also  share

the  responsibility  of bearing some of the  cost  for  their

skills training.  We should study in detail as to how we  can

obtain  the best benefit, whether through the CPF  scheme  or

channelling some of the retrenchment benefits or  some  other

means.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.19 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour movement plays a major role in assisting our

workers to ensure their welfare through enhancement of  their

employability.   NTUC  and  its affiliates  play  a  role  in

preserving  jobs  during our economic downturn.   Our  unions

have  taken proactive measures to ensure the welfare  of  our

workers  by identifying the challenges and problems that  may

arise  in  future and to propose solutions, even though  they

seem  to  be bitter initially.  In other words, NTUC and  the

labour movement in Singapore are members of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>

the  civil  society  that is important to  Singapore.   As  a

result of their roles, the life and welfare of Singapore  has

been improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, to be a member of the civil society,

we  should  not only make political comments.   Hundreds  and

thousands of union leaders at the various levels have  played

a  constructive  role  in  further  improving  the  lives  in

Singapore  without touching on political matters  alone.   We

should  encourage active citizenship such as this in  various

fields.  That  includes  grassroots activities  such  as  the

Residents'  Committees  and  self-help  groups.  This   would

enhance  the  bond  between the people of Singapore,  whether

racially,   between   people   of  different   socio-economic

backgrounds and between Singaporeans and foreign workers  who

are living here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active citizenship need not be separate from organs of

state.  In the matter of inter-racial relations, I agree with

the proposal by Mr Yatiman Yusof that we set up an agency for

policy  studies  to build a Singapore nation.   Or  at  least

there  should  be  periodic  studies  to  evaluate  how   far

Singapore   has   been  more  cohesive.   Besides   enhancing

understanding  between the people, the races  and  religions,

through studies and discussions, this effort can suggest  new

activities  towards this objective to enhance cohesion  among

the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in relation to ethnic relations, it

is  indeed  sensitive  but  it  has  to  be  discussed.   The

statement by the Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, has caused

many  Malays  to  be unhappy because they  felt  that  it  is

questioning  their  loyalty.   Some  also  felt  that   these

questions should not have been raised openly.  If some Malays

have  expressed  their disappointment and  unhappiness,  they

need  not  be  irrational.  This is an  expression  of  their

feelings.  However, generally, Malays feel that Singapore  is

their motherland and it is where their loyalty lies.  Indeed,

if we are going to build a Singapore nation, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>

need  to  discuss sensitive matters such as  this.   However,

although  it  is  true that mutual trust will  take  time  to

achieve, it need not be allowed to take forever.  The  Malays

and  Muslims and other minorities must decide how  to  manage

their  feelings whenever sensitive issues such as  these  are

discussed.   However, although they feel unhappy, considering

their  position  as  the  minority  group,  they  must   also

understand  that, as has been discussed before in this  House

and  raised  by the Prime Minister just now, the Chinese  who

form  the majority in Singapore are a minority in the region.

Other   races   too  must  understand  their   sensitivities.

However,  as  I  mentioned earlier, at  the  same  time,  the

sensitivities of the Malays and the minorities must  also  be

understood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not completely cover the fissures between the

races just by discussing or debating sensitive issues.   Just

because  we want to fill up these fissures, it does not  mean

that  these  fissures will no longer exist.  And if  we  have

made  progress, it does not mean that differences of opinions

and sensitivities will not occur in future.  What is clear is

that  we  must continue to improve on it.  We must strengthen

the  understanding  among each other  to  build  cohesion  in

Singapore. I hope that further discussion on such issues  can

take  these matters into consideration.  All participants  of

the civil society must understand this reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the motion by Mr Davinder

Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, the President stressed  in  his  Speech

that  we  must strengthen our social cohesion, that  we  must

strengthen our common Singaporean identity and, at  the  same

time,  we  must  encourage all our people  to  become  active

citizens,  thus  showing the major focus of our  Government's

policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People form the foundation of a nation. When the

foundation  is strong, the nation will prosper.   All  along,

the  Government's policy has been benefiting the  people  and

the country.  To our people, we stress the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>

importance  of education and training as the way  to  develop

the  intellect of the people, to increase their knowledge and

to  enhance  their skills.  Therefore, it is  ridiculous  for

Buruma,  a  foreign  columnist, to say that  Singapore  is  a

country practising the obscurantist policy under which people

become  stupid and cannot think.  This is far from the truth.

If  we  say  that the Singapore Government is  an  autocratic

government, then all the policies practised by the Government

will  all  be  wrong.  Because an autocratic government  will

implement obscurantist policy like the first emperor  of  the

Qin  Dynasty to burn all books and to bury the scholars.  But

the Singapore Government did no such thing.  On the contrary,

its  policy  is aimed at helping our people to march  towards

the high technology and knowledge-based IT society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, I can say that the Government has

been  taking very good care of the people.  Over  time,  this

has caused the people to be over-dependent on the Government.

In  other  words,  our  people expect the  Government  to  do

everything  for  them,  and they  seem  to  be  losing  their

initiative.  I think this is an anomaly that we must correct.

The  society cannot always depend on the Government to  drive

them  around.   The people must have their own initiative  to

take  part  actively.  I think this is the  true  meaning  of

active citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, as the President has pointed out in his

Speech, we have enjoyed one whole generation of racial

harmony.  But we cannot presume that the various social fault

lines have already disappeared.  There still exist in our

society some  clear and obvious barriers, including racial

barriers, religious barriers, language barriers, cultural

barriers, and even barriers in education streams.  To create

a more cohesive society and to forge a stronger sense of

Singaporean identity, we must try our best to remove all

these barriers.  We must encourage our people to become

active citizens.  We must create a more participatory

society.  In terms of removing the barriers, we must adopt a

more positive attitude and active approach.  So I feel that

the initiative

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>

should not always come from the Government.  More initiatives

should now come from our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school is a place where we inculcate in our young

the  right  values and national identity.  So the unification

of  the  language  streams  in our schools  has  removed  the

language barrier.  But this is only applicable to the case of

the  new  generation.   Those who have  come  from  the  past

language stream schools, I think the barriers still exist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can approach the problem from the following areas:

Firstly,    through   the  grassroots  and   the   community.

Secondly,  through  the  mass media.   Thirdly,  through  the

Government.  Let me first talk about the grassroots  and  the

community.   The  grassroots  organisations  (GROs)  and  the

community  centres  play  a very  important  role.   The  GRO

members, such as RC members, CCC members, CCMC members,  etc,

have  set  a  very  good  example.   Through  the  grassroots

network, we are able to communicate a very important  message

to  our  people and, that is, the citizens can actively  take

part.   There  are  many channels for them to  take  part  in

public  affairs.  The question is whether you  want  to  take

part  or  not.  It is not a question of whether  you  can  or

cannot  take part.  The question is whether or not you  want.

So   the  various  activities  organised  by  the  grassroots

organisations  encourage the various residents  of  different

ethnic  groups to take part to interact and to break  through

the barrier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mid-Autumn Festival or the Lantern Festival

is basically a Chinese festival, I  noticed that there was  a

breakthrough  in  the  Festival this  year.   The  grassroots

organisations  encouraged children from  the  various  ethnic

groups  to  take part in the  traditionally Chinese festival.

It  helped  to  promote  some kind of interaction  among  the

children  of  the various ethnic groups, and gave  them  some

good  time together.  This is very important in strengthening

our Singaporean identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all our ethnic communities have

their own wealth of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>

cultural  traditions.  It is important to preserve one's  own

cultural  traditions.  But if you want to create  a  stronger

Singaporean consciousness and identity, we must break through

these  traditions.   In this regard, I think  the  activities

organised  by the grassroots organisations are good examples.

Leaders  of  the  various ethnic groups should  change  their

mindset  and  must  put  in  efforts  to  ensure  that  while

maintaining  their  own fine cultural traditions,  they  must

also  actively try to remove the barriers among  the  various

ethnic groups.  I think there is no contradiction between the

two.  One is to maintain the differences and the other is  to

try and create common ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the social level, the mass media have not been given

enough  attention in this regard.  Take the  newspapers,  for

example.   As  of  now,  our newspapers  basically  go  along

language  lines.   The newspapers of the different  languages

have  different emphasis in their coverage of events and they

also  reflect  mainly the views of communities  speaking  the

respective languages.  This appears to be a commonly accepted

model but, objectively speaking, this kind of situation  will

create  barriers and imbalance in information  dissemination.

For  example,  the Lianhe Zaobao  has a lot of stories  about

the  Chinese  community every day, some of which  are  hardly

carried in the other language newspapers. On the other  hand,

Berita Harian, the Malay language newspaper, concentrates  on

reports on the Malay community and carries the views of Malay

MPs  and  activities in the Malay community.  In my view,  to

have a more cohesive society, this kind of arrangement should

be adjusted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite three examples to illustrate this point: the

SAP  school, the Chinese High School incident and  the  Malay

community's request for dialogue with SM Lee.  Not long  ago,

the  question  of  SAP schools was debated quite  intensively

both  inside and outside this House.  This highlights a  very

important  point that people from different communities  with

different educational backgrounds have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>

different  understanding.   There  is  a  barrier  in   their

understanding.  So from the English newspaper's point of view

or  reaction,  you  can  observe that  many  of  the  English

educated do not quite understand the meaning of a SAP school.

The  Chinese  and  English newspaper readers  have  different

reactions.   The  English educated are more critical  on  the

issue,  whereas  the  Chinese  newspaper  readers  are   more

defensive about the SAP schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Chinese newspapers you can hear the views on

the  subject  from the Chinese educated.  They represent  the

voice of the Chinese community, but we do not see or hear the

views  or  reactions from the Malay community or  the  Indian

community.  This is one example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Chinese High School incident. I am not here

to  comment  on  this  matter, but the  Chinese  High  School

incident is a matter of concern to various people.  The  same

incident as reported in the different language newspapers can

create different impressions.   For instance, on the issue of

whether  the students should be involved in this affair,  the

English-educated readers reacted very strongly.   They  wrote

to  the  Forum  page and advocated that students  have  their

rights,  but  there is no such view reflected in the  Chinese

newspaper. The Chinese educated parents feel that it is  very

important  that  the  problem  be resolved quickly,  but  the

students  should  not  be involved.   A  presumably  English-educated   columnist   in  an  English   language   newspaper

mistakenly took the singing of Yue Fei's Man Jiang Hong (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) to mean a bloodshed that forms a blood-red river, and even

extended  her  imagination to visualize a Bukit  Timah  canal

becoming a blood-red river.  You do not find such a thing  in

the Chinese newspaper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three characters man jiang hong ( ) may

literally mean the whole river is red. But actually, this  is

merely the name of the tune to which ci (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) poems were

composed,  predominantly in the Song  dynasty.   Examples  of

other such tunes are: man ting fang (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),

shui long yin (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), shui diao getou

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>

(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) etc. Man Jiang Hong is just one

of  these  names of set tunes.  It does not signify that  the

whole river is red, full of blood.  There is no such meaning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to point out is that the reports of the

various  language  newspapers  reflect  different  views  and

different understanding of issues.  So if you read  only  the

Chinese  newspapers or  only the English newspapers, then  on

the   same  event,  for  example,  the  Chinese  High  School

incident,  you may have different impressions,  and  come  to

different conclusions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last example or illustration I would like to mention

is  on the statement of SM Lee which generated some reactions

among  the  Malay community.  This is about the  position  of

Malays  in  our armed forces.  This is not a new issue.   But

every  time  it  is mentioned, it creates a strong  reaction.

Just  now, Mr Hawazi also mentioned about this in his speech.

Some  members  of  the Malay community have requested  for  a

dialogue  with SM Lee.  On this issue, if you have  read  the

Berita  Harian,  you  will know that  the  Malay  community's

reaction  on  the  matter  is very strong.   There  are  also

comments  and  opinions expressed.  But in the  case  of  the

newspapers  of other languages, the report is less prominent.

So  we  would  not be able to learn from the  other  language

newspapers that kind of strong reaction as reflected  in  the

Malay language newspaper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for those people who do not read the Malay newspaper

or those who read only the Chinese or English newspaper, they

may  even  get  the  wrong impression that  this  is  not  an

important  issue.  They may  not even be interested  in  this

issue  at  all.   But  actually, this is an  issue  that  all

Singaporeans  should  be concerned with.   There  is  nothing

wrong   with   newspapers  of  different   languages   giving

prominence  to news or events concerning their own respective

communities. But in order to strengthen our social  cohesion,

the  newspapers  of different languages should  go  one  step

further  to  play a positive role.  For example, the  various

newspapers of different languages should set up a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>

separate  column  to  report on other communities  so  as  to

exchange  information throughout all the various  communities

to promote better understanding of one another and for better

dissemination of information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to deal with the Government and

the  public sector.  The unification of the language  streams

of  schools  is  important  for  the  creation  of  a  common

identity.  But this development has also created a  sense  of

alienation among some communities, especially in the  Chinese

community.   The older members of the Chinese community  have

all  along  been active in the grassroots organisations.   In

fact,  they are the backbone of the grassroots organisations.

They have not only taken part in charitable work, in the clan

activities,  community activities, but they have  also  taken

part in the grassroots organisations like the CCC, RC and the

CCMC. They donate money.  They put in efforts.  I think  this

is  very  closely  linked  with their educational  background

because  most  of  these  people are  businessmen.   So  they

practise  the  idea  of  deriving from society  and  repaying

society.   They  have this belief and philosophy.   They  are

different from our younger generation who are basically wage-earners.  So financially, the younger generation may  not  be

able  to  contribute so much by donating money  and  spending

time  and efforts at the same time.  However, because of  the

dominance of the English language in our society, this  group

of  active  Chinese community leaders begin to feel  cut  off

from  the  mainstream in our society.  They have a  sense  of

loss.   They  feel that they are being rejected  out  of  the

mainstream  of society.   This is a question which   we  must

seriously look into in our attempt to create a more  cohesive

society.   This  group of people may not  be  able  to  speak

English  or may not be able to speak English well.  But  they

have set up, as I have pointed out earlier, good examples  as

active citizens in our society. We must continue to give them

the  due respect, listen to their views, listen to what  they

have in their hearts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in short, we want to create a

common heartware of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans.  Then we must change the present  social  make-up.   Now we still have different kinds of heartware  in  our

different   communities.   For  example,  we  have  different

heartware  of different ethnic groups, different  educational

streams, and so on and so forth.  We want to create a  common

Singapore  heartware.  If we want to break  through  the  old

model and create a new one here, we must put in more efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I thank all Members who have  joined  in  the

debate.  It was lively and interesting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members spoke on a wide variety of issues. Their

speeches  reflect the views of Singaporeans.  Some  of  their

concerns  have been addressed by the Prime Minister  and  the

Ministers  who  joined  in  the  debate.   But  many  of  the

questions which have been raised are not capable of  easy  or

ready   answers.   The  dialogue  on  these  issues   between

Singaporeans  and the Government will continue for  years  to

come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate has been characterised by three broad

themes.  First, the Government's people orientation.  Second,

the  consensus  in this House about what the  Government  has

done  right  and, third, the sad and disappointing recurrence

of cliches from Members of the Opposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the policies for the people. The focus on people

took centre stage. There was a useful exchange of views about

civil  society and active citizenship.  Many MPs spoke  about

the need to give people more space, while recognising that it

is  a  two-way  deal.   We are agreed on certain  fundamental

points.   Firstly, that it will take us a long, long time  to

settle on a consensus.  Secondly, that to a large extent, the

initiative lies with the people because a top-down dictate on

public  participation  in the affairs  of  the  nation  is  a

paradox.  And thirdly, we must involve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>

people  of  all  backgrounds, different  education,  English,

Chinese, different races, different religions to settle at an

acceptable  compromise.  But we also have to understand  that

these  concepts  of civil society and active citizenship  are

not pegs on which to hang any argument because the moment  we

descend  into  argument for argument sake, we will  not  only

lose but kill the momentum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of MPs made the very good point that there is

nothing new in this emphasis on people.  The Government  has,

ever  since it has taken office, had people at the  forefront

of its policies.  In return for being elected, the Government

has  looked after the needs of Singaporeans - housing,  jobs,

education, safety, healthcare, money in the pocket and in the

bank. We have, in a manner of speaking, moved from black  and

white  to colour. We have moved from basics in many instances

to  luxuries  and in terms of material needs and  dignity  of

life,  we  have  very  little to  complain  about.   To  many

Singaporeans,  these policies have had and will  continue  to

have a far greater impact on them and their families than the

issue of political space.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because these fundamentals have been settled that

we  can  afford  to shift the emphasis to the next  phase  of

development.  Questions like, should we tinker with our model

of  democracy, how do we change the attitudes of Singaporeans

to  learning  and life-long employability,  how  do  we  keep

Singaporeans rooted, have been discussed in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of the issue, people development is very

much  tied to our education policy.  That explains  the  huge

interest in this debate in our education system.  We  clearly

have  a  good system but changes need to be made.   MPs  have

made  useful  suggestions.  The Minister  for  Education  has

talked about his Ministry's efforts to enhance the talent  of

every   student,  make  them  world-ready  while  rooted   to

Singapore.  These  experiments will  not  address  everyone's

concerns.   They will generate anxieties of their  own.   But

the  point is, that MPs are willing to speak up in a rational

and moderate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>

fashion if they and their constituents are unhappy, and  more

importantly,  that the Government is willing  to  change  and

experiment to deal with these concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this afternoon, we saw first-hand the impact of the

pleas  of  some of the MPs and NMPs in relation to compulsory

education.   That effort has paid dividends  with  the  Prime

Minister saying that he is going to instruct the Ministry  of

Education to look at compulsory education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have truly come a long way. We are now concerned

about the definition of "success".  But it is not an esoteric

or  philosophical discussion.  It is important because it  is

an  issue  whose time has come.  Parents are concerned  about

the  pressure in schools.  They grew up in a system where the

bright  lights  shone  only on those who excel  academically.

They  are not sure if they want their children to go  through

the  same  grind.  MPs have spoken about the  need  for  more

character, as opposed to content development in the  schools.

The Government is reacting to this shift in attitudes. At the

end of the day, we must strike some practical balance between

our  determination to be number one in everything we  do  and

easing out on the pressure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not going to be easy, all the more so when given

our  ageing  society and the fact that we are  not  replacing

ourselves.  How  do  we continue to top the  charts  with  an

increasingly aging workforce and when the shrinking group  of

younger  workers  do  not consider that  drive  is  always  a

virtue?   If success is redefined to mean that endeavours  in

enterprise are matters of fashion as opposed to necessity, we

will  all pay an economic price, what the Americans  call  "a

double whammy", with lower growth and the increased burden of

supporting  an  aging  society.  It is  easy  to  talk  about

letting  up  on  the  pressure, but it is very  difficult  to

strike that balance of continuing to be at the forefront  and

relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second theme which has marked this debate is the

consensus in this House about what the Government has done

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>

right.  Interestingly enough, that consensus is apparent more

from  what  was  not said in the debate than from  what  was.

This  debate has been significant for the non-issues as  much

as  it  has  been for the issues. We have had three  days  of

debate.  There  were  more than 50 speakers.  They  spoke  at

length.   There  was  ample time and opportunity  to  express

dissatisfaction.   Yet, not one Member had anything  critical

to  say  about the honesty, integrity and credibility of  our

institutions.   As the criticism in this House of  Government

policies  reflects the view of Singaporeans, so too the  lack

of  criticism about our institutions.  Let us look at  a  few

examples which we tend to take for granted and which  explain

why they are not raised in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Singapore judiciary. It is respected here

and  around the world for its integrity and credibility.  Not

many people appreciate the importance of a credible judiciary

to  a  country.   A  weak  or pliant  judiciary  can  have  a

devastating  effect  on  people and their  morale.  Like  the

decisions  of civil servants, the decisions of judges  affect

people  more directly than the policies which we  discuss  in

this  House.   Judges  ensure that there is  a  level-playing

field,  that  every  Singaporean, rich or  poor,  is  treated

fairly  and on the merits.  A country is in big trouble  when

people lose trust in the legal and judicial system.  I do not

overstate  the  case.  If a judicial system is  corrupt,  the

rich get justice, the poor do not.  The powerful get justice,

the  weak do not.  Commercial disputes are settled not by the

merits,  but  by the strength of a party's purchasing  power.

When  the  poor and the weak have no justice or believe  that

they  have  no  chance in the system, that system  will  soon

unravel, maybe not in a year or two, but in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our rights are protected regardless of who

we  are.  Our  disputes  are settled by  a  fair  and  proper

application of the law.  Our judges, like our civil  servants

and  leaders, act on the principle that their credibility  is

everything.   I  am  glad that we have  a  ringing  consensus

albeit by silence on that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither was there an issue on the integrity of our civil

service.   No  amount of talk about policy changes  or  about

political  space and the right to participate  will  and  can

stop  a  people  from deserting a country physically  and  in

spirit,  if people feel that the system is crooked  and  that

they have no chance.  There was no issue in this debate about

our  credibility and consistency.  In Singapore, when we  set

the  rules, we play by those rules, in good times and in bad.

Foreign  investors know and have come to respect that.   Very

few  people understand the value of that asset.  It  accounts

for  our  standing in the commercial world.  It accounts  for

our standing in the political world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to the third broad theme of this debate. I

do it with some degree of sadness and disappointment.  When I

opened the debate, I said that cliches and platitudes are not

going  to  help  the  debate.   I  was  naive.   Despite  the

opportunity to make constructive suggestions about  improving

the  system,  there has been nothing but a  torrent  of  wild

propositions  from the Opposition. We are told, for  example,

that  the Government fears that the people will one day  rise

against it.  Not only does it ring hollow, it is bizarre.  Is

that  what  people  are talking about in  the  streets?   Are

Singaporeans who have come out best in this crisis clamouring

for  a  change of Government?  How do these absurd statements

help  in  the debate?  How are Singaporeans better  off  from

this kind of contribution?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also told that there is no democracy in

Singapore.  This, from a man who makes the point in  a  forum

to  which he is democratically elected, in a debate which  is

open  to  the public and the media. This, from a man who  has

spent his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>

political life vilifying this Government and yet remains free

to  enjoy  the freedom to do it again and again.  Is  that  a

helpful  contribution to the debate?  Are we any wiser  about

the kind of model that we should seek to construct?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the question we have to ask

ourselves  is:   has  this debate helped in  the  process  of

nation-building?   Have  we  contributed  to  a  constructive

discussion which is good for the country?  Members have  made

many thought provoking comments and suggestions. They deserve

further  consideration.  For that, I thank Members.   I  also

thank them for supporting the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I thank you, Sir, and Mr Speaker, Sir, for your

patience.  [Applause.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the
