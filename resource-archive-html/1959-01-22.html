<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question [21st

January, 1959], "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.01 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the suspension of the

debate  yesterday, I was making the point that we  made

approaches  to  the  Federation to  recognise  a  Pan-Malayan  economic unit concept, but we  have  not  been

successful so far and, in the interim period before  we

or the next government can succeed to power, we have to

take  measures  to protect our economy  by  creating  a

second basis for our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we consider this point, we have got to divide

our  approach into three distinct groups. The first is:

what  is  the ideal that is desirable, reasonably?  The

ideal   desirable  is  a  political  merger  with   the

Federation.   Failing  that,  of  course,   the   ideal

desirable  is  to  have  a  Pan-Malayan  economic  unit

concept accepted by the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point you have to consider is: if the ideal is

unattainable within the foreseeable future, what can be

done  within the realms of possibilities and  when  can

such  possibilities come to fruition? For my part, Sir,

I  have not the slightest doubt that the day will  come

when,  by  force  of circumstances, Singapore  and  the

Federation  will  have to recognise  that  economically

they  cannot stand alone, each by itself. But again,  I

have  not  the slightest doubt that that day  will  not

come  quickly  and that, before such a  day  comes,  we

shall  have to convince the Federation that the benefit

from  such  a concept will not only accrue to Singapore

but that the benefit is also mutual - that the Federation

will  stand to benefit as much. It is only when we  can

prove this to the Federation or when the Federation can

learn this because of force of circumstance or by trial

and  error, that we can be in a position to  make  them

accept  that  concept of one economic unit.  Therefore,

the  time factor is anybody's guess. For my part, I  do

not  think  it  would be possible to have this  concept

accepted by them in the next year or two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we come to the third point and that is to

accept  what  is facing us now and to do  what  we  can

about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>





What  is  facing  us  now is that  we  are  unnaturally

divided  and  that  we  are in  a  position  where,  if

politicians on both sides are not careful, we could try

to  destroy  each other economically, and  possibly  go

further  than that. That is why I have always  resisted

the  Member  for Changi and others who have  indicated

that  they  would  like  to  fight  it  out  with   the

Federation. I would say "No". Short of fighting out  an

economic  war with the Federation, in which I  have  no

hesitation in saying that we will come out the worse-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir, I think the hon. Member

has had enough opportunity. Short of fighting it out, I

think we should make all efforts to try to create  some

things here in Singapore which could counterbalance the

difficulties that we are facing now. I know,  Sir,  it

could  be  said  that we promise on our Party  platform

that we would try to get a merger, but that should  not

preclude  acceptance of the fact, as  it  stands,  that

merger  is still a faraway dream. But again, this  does

not mean that we refuse to try to get a merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, now I come to the main points

raised by the Members of the Opposition in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the point over which there has been quite

a lot of Press publicity and to which many Members have

referred  in  different terms - the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  has put it rather emphatically - and that is this.

I  refer to the report as it appears in today's Straits

Times:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Referring to tax relief measures for pioneer

industries approved earlier in today's session, Mr Lee

said the tariff Bill was the third major measure in one

day.  But there was hardly time for the schemes  to  be

brought to fruition before the government went  out  of

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee said the government was producing a spate of legislation in its last few weeks of office."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



The same comment was made by the Member for Telok Ayer,

the Member for Tiong Bahru and various other Members. I

want,  Sir,  to  dispel  the impression  that  this  is

something  that has been hurriedly thought of-again  in

the  words  of the Member for Tanjong Pagar, "Too  many

clever  things are thought out, spoken out even  before

they  are  put  down on paper, quoted and then  quickly

retracted."  That is not so. If hon.  Members  care  to

stretch their memories back to 1956, they will remember

that  it  was  in  this  House that  I  made  a  policy

statement  on  7th November, 1956, on the  Government's

economic  policy, just as the Mayor made his  statement

at  the  beginning of his term of office and said,  "We

want  to put up 200 standpipes." Whether the water goes

into  the standpipes or not is another matter, but they

are there! But mine was a thought-out policy statement.

What  does this statement say besides assuring  foreign



capital  about  freedom  of  repatriation  of  profits,

creating   a   suitable  climate,  giving   immigration

facilities    to    skilled    workers,    technicians,

administrative personnel, and so on, giving  facilities

for  the importation of raw materials, even from dollar

areas? It goes on to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(e) Government intends that a survey of the colony's

industrial  potential and markets be  carried  out.

Inquiries  are  now being made in order  to  obtain

the services of experts to undertake this survey."



<br><br>Sir, a survey of the Colony's industrial potential  and

markets  is not a thing that can be done overnight.  At

the  moment,  we  are  carrying out  a  survey  of  the

factories  and  the  present  industries  obtaining  in

Singapore and that survey will show how Government  can

assist. Then it goes on to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(f) Government intends to establish an Institute of

Scientific and Industrial Research for the  purpose

of   investigating  and  giving   advice   on   the

technological  and  economic aspects  of  industry.

Arrangements  have been made to obtain  the  advice

of an expert on the setting up of this Institute."



<br><br>An  expert  was  obtained under the Colombo  Plan.  The

expert made his recommendations to the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



and they were that the Institute should be Pan-Malayan.

Negotiations are still going on with the Federation  of

Malaya  and  therefore  the  scheme  has  not  come  to

fruition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(g) Government has decided to set up an Industrial

Promotion  Board with a $1,000,000  revolving  fund

to give financial assistance to small industries."



<br><br>That has been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(h) Government is investigating the question of

making   tax   concessions  to   industries   whose

expansion   or  establishment  it  is  desired   to

encourage."



<br><br>That was done yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, between announcing the policy and bringing it to

fruition, there must be a lapse of time if you  have  a

reasonable  democratic  government.  If  you   have   a

dictatorial form of government, they just use the  Whip

and  carry things through. But with a democratic setup,

you cannot have that and therefore you have got to give

consideration to all the issues that are involved;  the

revenue  issue is involved because income tax  is  Pan-Malayan. But we passed the Industrial Expansion (Relief

from  Income  Tax)  Bill  and  the  Pioneer  Industries

(Relief  from  Income  Tax) Bill yesterday.  These  two

Bills  and  the  Bill  we  are debating  now  were  not

hurriedly thought of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Consideration of the extremely difficult and complex

problem of tariff protection will be deferred until the

industrial  potential  and  markets  survey  has   been

completed and studied."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 7th November, 1956, this programme was thought

out. It is not something that the Minister has cleverly

thought of overnight and "rushed through", in the words

of the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Member for Telok Ayer.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> "Too many things were spoken out

even before they are put on paper." It is preposterous,

Sir,  to  suggest  that.  It is already  the  announced

policy  of  the  Government. Now, why  have  two  years

elapsed  before  the implementation of  this  announced

policy? The answer lies in the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



this  is a democratic Government. This Government  does

not  do  things  on the lines of the  City  Council  in

Singapore.  We  do things after getting  proper  public

reaction.  We  do things after looking  into  each  and

every angle, because, to tamper with the economy,  Sir,

is  not,  as the Malays put it, a "main-main" business.

It  is not a business that you just do as the whim  and

fancy  seizes  you.  And  then again,  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar blithely goes on to say that  though  he

does  not  oppose protection-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whilst we [his Party]

recognise the changing facets of our economy  and  that

of the surrounding territories, primarily Indonesia and

the  Federation, we do not think it wise or prudent  to

have any sudden switches in economic policy."



<br><br>What he means is whether they want to have any switches

at  all.  The switch has come, of course, in the  Party

policy  of the People's Action Party, and that is  away

from  the  extreme Left Wing. There is an  element  now

which  is  trying to woo foreign capital, because  they

realise  that,  whilst in the opposition,  the  extreme

Left Wing was the thing to play upon; now that they see

that  they have a chance to become the Government, they

have  now  got  to  change the way of thinking  of  the

people and say, "Extreme Left Wingism is bad." So:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While the Party does not oppose what the Minister

has   termed  selected  protection  for  industry,   it

recognises that the Singapore market consists of only 1½

million people to provide the necessary attraction."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fact we have recognised too, but then where the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar goes wrong is when  he  says

that  while  Singapore  could give  protection  to  1.5

million  people,  the Federation could  give  it  to  7

million people. In numbers, yes, but if anybody  wishes

to  analyse reports, in purchasing power, it is  not  a

ratio  of  7  : 1.5. but it is a ratio of 2  :  1.  Our

consumption  is one-third Pan-Malayan. The Federation's

consumption  is  two-thirds Pan  Malayan,  and  to  all

intents and purposes, for the industrialists, it is the

purchasing  power  ratio  that  matters  and  not   the

population ratio that matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member attacks me, Sir, by saying, "The

Minister   appears  to  be  a  man   crying   out   for

recognition." Sir, the fact that I quoted my speech  at

Seattle  in the Colombo Plan meeting indicated  to  him

that  I  was crying out for recognition. Sir,  no  such

thing  was  in  my mind. Why I went to  the  length  of

putting  up  a  full case to this House was  because  I

recognise    that    this   House   is   democratically

constituted.  I  could have spoken  a  formal  sentence

"That I beg to move", and sat down and got the Whip  to

pass the Bill through. It could have been done, as  far

as  the  Government side was concerned, with  a  speech

lasting  three  minutes. Let the  Opposition  take  two

hours if they wish to. But, Sir, we recognise that this

House  is  democratically constituted and we would  not

fetter  the democratic expression of opinion. Therefore

I  went  to  great lengths to put down  on  record  why

Government was doing these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fact is that in law you cannot express

intentions. You only express facts, but the  intentions

are also important for the future, because the facts as

put  in  the  law can be malad-ministered by  a  future

government. It is then that the intentions which are on

record can be brought out and the battle can be fought.

That  is why I went to these lengths. It is not to  get



recognition  that  I was a clever  man  trying  to  put

something across the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Tanjong Pagar said of me, "The

reason  why nobody paid any attention to him  was  that

they  knew  what he said did not count." That indicates

the ego in the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar. Only what

he  says  counts  and what other people  say  does  not

count.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, Sir, the bad fortune of Singapore that there

are  politicians who are ready to ignore the  realities

of the economic situation for their own political ends.

The  Member for Tanjong Pagar criticised the Government



when he said that after thinking out clever things they

were  quickly retracted. It is no such thing, Sir.  The

policy  was  announced  on 13th  August  last  and  the

Government intends



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>



to carry out that policy as announced by me. If the law

in  its  drafting can be brought to a state where  that

policy  could be expressed clearly, this Government  is

not  going to stand in the way of such clear expression

in  the  law.  There is no question  of  retraction  or

withdrawal of policy. The Bill is going through. If  it

is  a matter of quibbling over words in the law, if the

law  can  be  more clearly defined, I am not  going  to

stand in the way so long as the policy that we want can

be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar talked of

managerial   and  technical  skills.   Sir,   we   have

recognised  technical  skill. We have  the  Polytechnic

running  now  to  provide technical skill.  It  is  not

something  that  is now freshly thought  out,  but  the

curious thing, Sir, is this, and this is found  in  the

People's Action Party's fourth Anniversary Celebrations

Souvenir, "Our Economic Future" by Dr Goh Keng Swee:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to do this [that is, to industrialise] we

must   train  a  cadre  of  managerial  and   technical

personnel to the highest standard of professional skill

as well as in Socialist principles."



<br><br>First,  the Party cannot get away from cadres.  We  had

the cadres that started the fires in 1955 and 1956. Now

the  Party  is going to have another set of  cadres  to

quell  the  fires which have frightened  capital  away.

Another  set  of  cadres to go down on their  knees  to



foreign  capital and say, "No, we are good boys."  Then

you  are  going to have a third set of cadres to  train

them  in managerial and technical skills as well as  in

Socialist  principles. Yet here they say that Socialist

principles cannot be applied to Singapore. It is  there

also. I do not know, Sir, whether this going around  in

various  cadres  is  going to help  Singapore,  but  it

evidently  shows  the confused way of thinking  of  the

Party.  Sir,  the  advanced  technical  and  managerial

skills are not the final answer, as is suggested by the

Member for Tanjong Pagar. The final answer, Sir, if you

want  to  be  competitive, is automation. Even  with  a

hundred  trained  technical  men,  if  you  have   hand

production, you cannot be competitive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



A  high degree of mechanisation is the answer and  that

means  that  Singapore has to look  out  not  for  five

industries employing fifty persons each, but a  hundred

industries  employing five persons each.  That  is  the

ultimate answer. Just having the technical knowledge is

not  the  ultimate answer. What is happening in Europe?

They  have  all the technical skill, and yet  they  are

highly  mechanized.  Sir, I now leave  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar. I had hoped that he would be here in the

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We go on to the Member for Tiong Bahru. When I quoted

all  those  restrictions, he asked why  I  did  not  do

anything to abolish those restrictions. If he had  gone

into  the constitutional aspects of Singapore, he would

have  noticed  that defence under the new  Constitution

still  remains in the hands of the British  Government.

There are certain aspects of trade which are related to



defence  and,  frankly, I think the  position  will  be

forced  in  the  next  Constitution.  If  there  is  an

unreasonable  government, they will force the  position

to  an  issue where either Britain will have to suspend

the  Constitution to see that its economic obligations,

as  far  as Communist countries are concerned, are  not

flouted,  or something new will have to come  out.  But

that is a matter that this Government cannot touch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he asked me whether tariffs would apply to goods

coming  from  the Federation. The answer is  that  they

would.  Just as tariffs apply to Singapore goods  going

to  the  Federation, they would apply to  goods  coming

from the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a lot of talk took place about Hongkong.

"Hongkong has 3,300 factories and cheap production. Why



cannot  the  Singapore  Government  do  the  same   for

Singapore?"  Now, Sir, it is only little  children  not

versed in the situation obtaining in the world, who  do

not  understand  the  difference between  Hongkong  and

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the expression "little

children"  is meant to refer to honourable  Members  of

the Assembly, then I think that expression is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



unparliamentary and I ask the Minister to withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I thought I was paying a

compliment as far as age is concerned! Ladies  will  be

flattered if we refer to them as-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want any debate on my

ruling. I ask the Minister to withdraw the expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I withdraw it, Sir, I defer to

your ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When China was taken over by the Communist

Government,  there was a flight of capital and  people,

who had industrial experience, to Hongkong. So what you

had  was  an  accumulation in Hongkong around  1950  of

technical  skill  and knowhow, and idle  capital  lying

there. Then on top of that came the flight of refugees.

And  so  you have the third factor, and that  is  cheap



refugee  labour  available  by  the  thousands.  Now  a

combination  of  these three factors  gave  Hongkong  a

windfall. The same conditions do not obtain here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir - and this is in reply not only to the

Member for Tiong Bahru but also to the Member for Telok

Ayer who said that the Government had spent most of the

reserves,  and taxation had gone up - this Government  is

an  elected  Socialist Government. This  Government  is

pledged  to  the  electorate  to  do  things  in  their

interests,  to bring about social legislation.  If  you

compare the number of social legislative measures  that

this  Government  has  brought about  with  the  number

during  the last 140 years of the Colony - you will  find

that  ours  outnumber them all: the  Clerks  Employment

Bill,   the   Factories  Bill,  the   Shop   Assistants

Employment Bill and so many others. This Government has

put  up cheap public housing by the thousands. In fact,

the housing that has been put up during the three years

of  the life of this Government exceeds the housing put

up  by  the  S.I.T. during all its previous ten  years.

About  half  the rents are subsidised. This  Government



has  built  schools by the hundreds. I  remember,  Sir,

offhand, in 1956, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



built  23  schools  against 7 that were  built  in  the

previous  years  of 1954 or 1955. The amount  given  to

Chinese  education, I believe - if I  am  not  wrong - rose

from $3 million to $13 million. You cannot have it both

ways.  You  cannot save money, keep your taxation  down

and  yet  provide all these services. They do not  come

out  of  the air. But if the hon. Member wants to  have

the  same  conditions as those obtaining  in  Hongkong,

where  human beings live a sub-human life, let him  put

it  up  publicly  on his platform when  he  stands  for

election  and  then see. Let the people decide  whether

they want to live like animals in hovels and in shacks,

with  their  children running about half-naked  in  the

streets,  playing  in  the ditches,  with  no  hope  of

getting education; and whether they want to work for  a

sub-standard  wage  of  a couple of  Hongkong  dollars,

toiling  and striving with no holidays, no freedom  and

no  leisure,  and the children dying if  they  catch  a

sickness,   because  there  are  not   enough   medical

facilities. Let the people decide whether they want all

this,  or  whether  they  want  what  is  obtaining  in

Singapore,  where people sometimes are  spoilt  to  the

extent  that if a bus stop is 200 yards away  they  say

they  want the bus stop removed nearer to their houses.

That again is the other extreme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru also alleged that

Singapore earns more dollars than any other country.  I

have  refuted that last month and I would  ask  him  to

look  up  the Hansard. It is dollars arising  from  the

Federation and other countries that we earn and not our

own dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big point which arose was referred to, I

think,  by  the Member for Tiong Bahru, the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  and by some other Members.  "Industries

established in Singapore will produce goods at a higher

cost  than  industries established in Europe and  other

places."  The  Member  for Telok Ayer  used  the  words

"penalising  the whole population to buy  at  a  higher

price".  That  is not true, Sir. He must recognise  the

fact  that we are buying mostly European goods  at  the

moment,  and  that  labour  in  Europe  is  much   more

expensive than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



labour  here,  even though Singapore's  labour  may  be

expensive  compared  with Hongkong,  China,  Japan  and

India.  But European and American labour is  much  more

expensive.  A country like England has very little  raw

materials  of its own. It imports all the raw materials

just  as we will have to do. There is no question  that

we  can produce cheaper goods than Europe. If we are as

mechanised   as  they  are,  and  if  our  methods   of

production  are as streamlined as theirs are,  then  we

can  probably  enter  the  export  market.  Sir,  these

Members  seem  to  have  taken  it  for  granted   that

Singapore cannot produce anything cheap, and yet if you

take  any  consumer goods, say the baby's Gripe  Water,

for  instance,  you pay $1.10 for a bottle;  the  stuff

that  goes into the bottle could probably be bought  in

any condiment shop for ten cents, and you distil it and

so  on. During the Japanese Occupation, I remember  one

person who made gripe water which was almost similar to

the  imported  brand and he sold it at forty  or  fifty

cents a bottle. Now, what are you paying $1.10 a bottle

for?  It  is  for  the  brand, because  the  people  of

Singapore have been accustomed to use the brand for 140

years. They go for the brand and they pay the price for

the  brand - not for the stuff that goes into the bottle.

I  do  not  say that the stuff is bad. I say  that  the

stuff is excellent, but it does not mean that we cannot

produce  the same excellent stuff if we wish  to  at  a

cheaper  cost?  What are you paying for  when  you  buy

foreign  goods? You are paying for foreign labour.  You

are  not  helping your own men to gain employment.  You

are  paying for foreign production. You are paying  for

foreign economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col. Lyle's report is enlightening, Sir. It says at

page 8:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, until economic union is achieved a tyre

factory is not a good risk and the people of Malaya for

some  time will probably continue to sell rubber at  90

cents  per pound and buy back tyres at $3.60 per pound,

the  difference going abroad to support the  labour  of

foreign countries."



<br><br>Sir, we have been blinded by a lot of propaganda in the

past - propaganda that colonialism is good; foreign goods



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



are  better  than ours; we are an inferior people,  and

therefore we cannot produce; today China is a producing

country,  and it can produce. I do not say  it  out  of

spite,  but  it is a fact. Japan too has  in  the  past

shown that it can produce as well, and I do not see why

we cannot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, three-quarters of everything a Singaporean

owns  and three-quarters of all he consumes is imported

and  thereby three-quarters of his income has  gone  in

the  past and is going in the present to support labour

and capital in foreign countries."



<br><br>That  statement  appears  at page  15  of  Col.  Lyle's

Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are people like the Member for Telok

Ayer - and  other  titled  gentry,  who  look  for   more

titles - who in the past would not even murmur  when  the

Government  put an embargo on 200 items of  trade  with

certain  countries, but would cry their loudest  if  an

elected government tried to help local people to set up

some  industries so as to increase production, so  that

our  imports could be cut down. They are the  type  of'

people who pose as champions of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A 140-year policy", says the Member for Telok Ayer,

"is  to be changed in a rush". It is not in a rush. Two

years ago I said that the question would be considered.

It  cannot be in a rush, and that is why the delay  has

occurred, and that is why this Bill has come at such  a

late stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer seems to endorse the 140-year policy - a colonial policy. He seems to live in the

colonial era still. Then he says that we will kill  all

the  entrepot trade and people will become  unemployed.

Sir, a man can cry "Fire", or "Tiger", or "Wolf" and so



on,  but what are the facts? I have explained the facts

and  I  hope the people will understand that it is  not

just because a man shouts that the Government will kill

trade, that the entrepot trade will go, that everything

will be finished, that they will all become unemployed,

all  this  will  take  place.  The  fact  is  that  the

Government wants to put people into employment, not  to

create unemployment. Therefore, the administration  of

this law will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



only  be where it is advantageous to Singapore. I  have

repeated that hundreds of times until I am blue in  the

face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member say, "Taxes have gone up. Who foots

the  bill?  The taxpayers; the voters." It is  not  the

voters.  The  voters  have got  the  benefit  of  cheap

education and hospitals. The bill is footed by the  man

who   makes  a  profit.  This  is  not  an  anti-social

measure - I  can  understand the Member  for  Telok  Ayer

objecting  to  this  measure. He has  used  words  like

"suicidal",      "throttle",      "ruin",      "scrap",

"madness" - possibly  hoping that  the  newspapers  would

have  big headlines for these words. Unfortunately  for

him,  Sir,  they  have not. But these  are  the  common

tactics of politicians to make propaganda capital. I do

not  blame  him for that, Sir, nor would  I  blame  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar. I do not blame the P.A.P. for

having somersaulted in their policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the Member for Telok Ayer says I gave flimsy

excuses for other restrictions which were no excuse for

passing  this Bill. Sir, I did not give flimsy  excuses

that because of the other restrictions, we are putting,

in this Bill, more restrictions. No. What I gave was to

justify that there are people who would not shout  when

certain  things  were done by the colonial  government,

but  who  would  shout  their  loudest  if  an  elected

government  tried to do things that are  good  for  the

people.  Sir,  though he says that the next  government

has  to  plan,  I say that the present Government  must

govern  till  the  last  day  of  its  life,  and  that

government  is  continuous and cannot  pause.  Economic

conditions do not wait for the changes of government or

for party politicians to manoeuvre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says, "Corruption might creep in. So why have

a  law  that might give way to corruption?" Sir,  there

are  hundreds of laws that we have in which the  chance

for  corruption exists, and it is public knowledge that

corruption  exists to a certain extent in many  places.

It  is  a  matter  of  pinpointing it.  The  fact  that



corruption exists is not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



reason  for not passing laws. If that were so,  then  I

think all our laws should be scrapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the big attack he makes is that certain

Ministers  in this Government have changed parties  and

therefore have no mandate. Sir, he himself first  stood

as   an   Independent,  then  he  joined  the  Liberal-Socialists  Party, and therefore his  mandate,  by  the

same reasoning, ceases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi posed two questions. I have

answered  one  question as to whether an  approach  has

been  made to the Federation Government, and the second

question was, "Has the Government accepted Col.  Lyle's

Report?"  No,  because  Col.  Lyle's  Report  came  out

recently  and the Government was anxious that since  it

has  so  much  that  the public should  understand,  it

should be tabled and that consideration could be  given

later.  It  is  being considered, but it was  not  held

back,  because Government might take time  to  consider

it.  It  is of the utmost importance that the  economic

position of today be made known to the public and  that

is why it was tabled and published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Siak Kew said I was trying to justify this move by saying that it is the Labour Front's platform.

It  is not a question of my trying to justify the move,

Sir. What I was trying was to answer the criticism that

I  have no mandate. It is not justifying because it was

a  Labour Front platform, but rather saying that I have

a  mandate. It was on my platform when I stood for  the

election. And so was it on all the Labour Fronters' who

stood for the elections. Coming to Mr Tan Siak Kew, he

referred  to  cigarettes  as  an  example - and  what  an

unfounded  criticism he made on cigarettes!  First,  he

said  that  a  lot  of  people  would  lose  trade   if

cigarettes  were  taken  over by government  factories.

There   is  no  intention  of  establishing  government

factories  unless foreign interests do  not  play  ball

with us. I said so - 49 per cent foreign capital will  be

invited  to  participate. 49  per  cent  local  private

capital, not government capital, and 2 per cent only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



government capital. But if foreign interests do  not

play  ball,  then I would say 51 per  cent  will  be

government  capital.  So  his  criticism  is  wrong.

Secondly,  he  said  a lot of persons  would  become



unemployed because there are a lot of people dealing

in  cigarettes. Sir, the import of cigarettes is the

monopoly of three or four firms here at the  moment.

The biggest import of cigarettes is made by one firm

and  that is seen by the answer the Hon. the  Acting

Financial   Secretary   supplied   to   this   House

yesterday. Therefore, it will be a matter of  taking

away  the business of one importing firm and  giving

it  to  one  manufacturing firm. It is common  sense

that  when  you manufacture, you employ more  people

than  when  you  import. The distribution  machinery

required for local manufacture will still remain the

same  as  that  for  the  distribution  of  imported

cigarettes - the same number of wholesalers (I do  not

say  the same people, in order to distinguish  them)

and  the  same number of retailers will be  required

for   the   distribution  of  locally   manufactured

cigarettes  if  the  imports  are  stopped.  So  the

retailers  will not be harmed, the wholesalers  will

not  be harmed, and the number engaged in the retail

or  wholesale cigarettes trade will not be affected.

The  only harm would fall on the importing monopoly.

Against  that would be the benefit of employment  to

the  local  people, the profits remaining  in  local

hands  or  that percentage of the profits  which  is

local  capital,  or  related to the  local  capital.

remaining  in  local  hands,  and  cutting  down  on

imports  to  a  certain  extent  - not  cutting  down

entirely,  because tobacco will have to be  imported

from  the  same  countries, from  America  and  from

Rhodesia, it will be the same quality of cigarettes,

and  cigarettes  are  not  a  complicated  thing  to

manufacture;  I  have  studied the  process.  Today,

Thailand  is producing exact replicas of  well-known

brands  and they have been accepted. It  is  a  Thai

Government monopoly there. The profit margin is very

big  in cigarettes and therefore that profit, or the

major part of it, will remain here. We will have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



to  import the tobacco and therefore pay for it, but

then we do not pay for the labour; we do not pay for

the  extra  freight charges on cigarettes  which  is

more  than what you pay for the compressed bales  of

tobacco.  And so how unfounded this criticism  could

be, Sir - this is a case in point.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> It will reduce

revenue.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It will not reduce revenue,

Sir, I  have said, "You replace your import revenue

by  putting  an  excise revenue  duty  in  the  same

proportion."  And  you do not pay  higher  for  your

cigarettes;  you sell it at the same price.  I  have

studied  the  case - a medium type  straight  Virginia

cigarettes costs about a cent per stick; today it is

being  sold  wholesale  to the  wholesalers  at  1.6

cents - the profit factor is half a cent - and  duty  is

added,  after  which it reaches the public.  If  you

take  the duty element away, you will find that  the

profit  factor  will still be the same  whether  you

manufacture it here or overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Time will tell.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> You do not lose! The same duty

element,  instead  of being put  on  the  import  of

cigarettes,  will be applied to the  manufacture  of

cigarettes as an excise. And therefore your  revenue

is  the same. There is not the slightest question of

loss  of  revenue.  That is again another  piece  of

propaganda  that  is  being publicised  by  affected

foreign  interests. Of course, I can understand  the

desire  of  certain political parties to  fall  head

over  heels  at the feet of foreign interests.  They

would  not care to look as to which foreign interest

is   advantageous  to  us  and  which  is   not.   I

differentiate - what is advantageous, I keep; what  is

not  advantageous, I say that we must try  and  push

ourselves into it.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Suicide!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> And that is the point about

detail. I am sorry the Member for

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar on one of his criticisms -  I

forgot what it was. But now that he is here, I might as

well  take  the opportunity of answering him.  He  said

that  I react very quickly to criticism. His definition

of  a  politician should be a cold, hard,  calculating,

and scheming person. Sir, I think we can be cold, hard,

calculating and scheming [Interruption]-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> -but we do not calculate and do

not  scheme  where  the  rice bowl  of  the  people  is

concerned.  That is more important than  filling  seats

and   becoming  Ministers.  I  consider  that  is  more

important, and that the rice bowl of the people  should

not  be  placed in jeopardy because certain politicians

are scheming to get into power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That the Bill be now

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill-[Mr J. M. Jumabhoy].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>10.44 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a note,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 5, (1) to leave out "No. 3"; (2) to

leave out "1958" and insert "1959".

<br><br>That will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Hon. Members will have noticed in the

Supplementary Order Paper that there are two amendments

which  are  to a certain extent allied. One is  in  the

name of the Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 11, to leave out "all" and insert

"any".



<br><br>The other is in the name of the Member for Farrer Park,

which inter alia proposes to leave out "all goods"  and

insert  the words* as shown in the Supplementary  Order

Paper.  This will bring into play paragraph  4  (d)  of

Standing Order 28. Hon. Members will find that at  page

13  of  the  Standing Orders. I will read the  Standing

Order to refresh the minds of hon. Members. It reads:



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The words are as follows-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"those goods recommended by a Tariff Board to be constituted by

the Minister under the chairmanship of an economic expert and which

shall consist of equal number of members representing the local

manufacturers, entrepot traders and consumers."

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Speaker or Chairman, before putting a

question to leave out certain words, is informed that a

Member  wishes to move an amendment to leave  out  part

only  of  these words and if he is of opinion that  the

proposed  amendment  of which  he  is  so  informed  is

substantially a new amendment, he shall,  if  possible,

put  the  question to leave out only  so  much  of  the

original  amendment  as  is unaffected  by  the  second

amendment; but if that question is agreed to, the whole

of  the words proposed in the original amendment to  be

left  out  shall be deemed to have been ordered  to  be

left out."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



I shall therefore call the amendment in the name of the

Member  for Farrer Park first, and then propose at  the

appropriate time that the word "goods" proposed  to  be

left  out, be left out. If that is agreed, then in  the

words  of  the  Standing  Order,  "the  whole  of   the

words" - that  is  both  words, "all  goods"  - "shall  be

deemed  to have been ordered to be left out",  and  the

question  on the words to be inserted will be proceeded

with.  If  the hon. Member's proposal fails,  then  the

Minister's   amendment  will  be  proceeded   with.   I

therefore call upon the hon. Member for Farrer Park  to

move his amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, to fit in with

my amendment the Hon. Minister's amendment will read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'by deleting from the definition of "dutiable goods"

appearing  therein  the  words  "intoxicating  liquors,

tobacco  or  petroleum" and substituting  therefor  the

words "any goods" instead of "all goods"'.



<br><br>Sir, based on that amendment, I will move my amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 11, to leave out '"any goods"' and

insert-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"those goods recommended by a Tariff Board to be

constituted by the Minister under the chairmanship of

an economic expert and which shall consist of equal

number of members representing the local manufacturers,

entrepot traders and consumers" '.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister's amendment has not

as  yet been put to the House, and therefore has not as

yet been carried. So the hon. Member's amendment is the

amendment  as  shown in the Supplementary Order  Paper,

that  is, to leave out "all goods" and insert the words

as shown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, my amendment to this Bill is, in

fact,  in sympathy with the aims now declared  by  this

Bill. But it seeks to ensure that protection tariff  is

enforced  without undue hardship to the  consumers  and

without   great  damage  to  the  entrepot  trade.   If

protection is to be granted to any local industry, that

claim  must  come  from the industry itself.  Secondly,

that  claim  must  be  thoroughly investigated  in  the

interests  of the consumers, the entrepot  traders  and

the local manufacturers. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



the Minister has almost agreed in principle to the need

for  such  a body and has created a Protection Advisory

Committee.  But the Committee is purely a  departmental

committee and it is not embodied in any permanent  laws

of  the Island. I am referring, Sir, to this Committee.

This   is  an  Advisory  Committee  to  protect   local

manufacturing industries. Paragraph 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To investigate individual applications by

manufacturers and potential manufacturers in  Singapore

for  protection and to advise the Minister for Commerce

and  industry on the necessity for protection  and  the

method  of protection whether by tariff or quantitative

restrictions  and extensive protective measures  having

due regard to-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the principles of the Industrial Development

policy  of the Government as set out from time  to

time;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the need to ensure the minimum dislocation and

damage to entrepot trade; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the economic benefits to Singapore acquiring from

the   industry  thus  protected,  outweighing   any

possible loss to the entrepot trade."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, the Hon. Minister has already accepted

the principle, and has formed the Advisory Committee to

carry  out  its work. But this Committee  is  purely  a

departmental  committee. My amendment is more  or  less

the  same  as the Minister's except that it would  give

this  body  a legal status. In the Advisory  Committee,

Sir,  there  is  no  representation of  the  consumers'

interests.  In  imposing duties of any  kind,  we,  the

elected representatives of the public, must ensure that

the interests of the consumers, particularly the poorer

class of consumers, must be safeguarded, not destroyed.

My  view  is  this - it  may be a  difficult  question - to

represent   the   consumers,   you   can    call    the

representatives  of  various  unions  and  co-operative

societies  to  represent  the consumers;  these  people

would be able to represent the consumers' interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of a Tariff Board in Singapore would

facilitate the setting up later of a Joint Tariff Board

of  Singapore and the Federation. We may  not  be  very

hopeful  at  present  of  a political  union  with  the

Federation of Malaya, and we are even less hopeful of a

concurrency of an economic unit with them; but a  Joint

Tariff Board is a proposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>



which  may attract the Federation of Malaya because  of

its  limited aims, and the advantages that  this  could

have  in  a  Pan-Malayan market for  industries,  while

retaining their autonomy in all other respects.  If  we

are  to  hope  at least for a common tariff  policy  of

Singapore and the Federation, it will be in my  opinion

a  sound  idea  to  begin  with  one  Tariff  Board  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I rise to oppose this

amendment.   It   is  true  that  I  have   voluntarily

implemented  the  system of having a Tariff  Protection

Committee. I have named a panel of persons from whom  I

will draw the Committee on each particular case. I have

fixed the terms of reference as indicated by the Member

for Farrer Park -(a), (b) and (c) - which he has read out

just  now. It is also true that I have stated  publicly

that  this  Committee will gazette all the  cases  that

they  are  going  to consider and that  representations

will  be  called for from all sides - something  on  the

lines that a Select Committee of the Assembly works on.

But   the  fundamental  difference,  Sir,  between  the

machinery  I  have set up and what is proposed  by  the

Member  for Farrer Park is this: that he wants to  make

the  Government a mere puppet. The original  Bill  says

the Governor in Council can levy duty on any goods.  My

new  amendment, of course, would tie it  down  further.

This clause in the definition would have the effect  of

the  Governor  in  Council having  tied  themselves  to

levying duty only on goods that are recommended by  the

Tariff Board, which means that the Government becomes a

mere puppet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on an issue of this sort, it is the Government

that  is  responsible to the people. It is inherent  in

the  democratic system that Government's powers  cannot

be  delegated to a non-elected Board, a Board which  is

subsidiary because it is nominated by the Government or

by  the  Minister. Therefore it is the Government  that

has  to  take the credit or shoulder the blame for  any

duties that it imposes. And that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>



fundamental  principle of the democratic system  cannot

be  ignored.  This amendment would seek to change  that

principle by giving the powers to a Tariff Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, my new amendment as proposed by me

which  will  come  up later on seeks  to  restrict  the

powers  of  the  Governor in Council to levying  duties

only   for   protective  purposes   and   taking   into

consideration the interests of the entrepot trade,  but

only  on  manufactured goods; and even in  manufactured

goods  not on textiles. This amendment could  give  the

Tariff  Board  the power to recommend  the  levying  of

duties on any goods, which means that the Tariff  Board

could  recommend to the Governor to impose  a  duty  on

copra or raw rubber coming from Indonesia. The Governor

in Council then has no power to say "No", because those

goods are recommended by the Tariff Board. That is  the

fundamental  difference. My Committee  is  an  advisory

one. But this would be one that supersedes the Governor

in Council, and that cannot be accepted.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

was  not  my intention to speak on this subject because

the  whole show, as I described it yesterday, is a  bad

one.  I am sure the incoming Government will scrap what

we are passing today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in any country where duties are levied,

there is a Tariff Board. The members of this Board  are

selected from various interested organisations so  that

their  interests  are protected, and  the  affairs  are

administered  by responsible persons.  Of  course,  the

final  choice is with the Government whether to  accept

or  reject their recommendations. That would be a  wise

move,  if  at all any Committee is appointed. It  would

not  restrict the Government or over-ride the Committee

or  Tariff Board, or whatever you call it. But whatever

that  may  be  named,  the  representatives  should  be

selected  from  those  who have  an  interest  in  this

matter, and also those who have opposing interests,  so

that both sides could give their views and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>



then  recommendations could be made to the Minister  or

to  the Government. I have no strong views on this, but

the  idea  underlying this suggestion  is  quite  good,

because   this   body   will   be   representing    the

manufacturers, entrepot traders and consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not correct to say that the Tariff Board will

recommend  items on which duties will be  levied,  like

textiles  or produce. It has been definitely said  that

they  will not, and they cannot interfere in that. This

aspect  of the argument on the part of the Minister  is

quite  wrong,  but, at the same time, I do  insist  not

only  on  this  Government  but  any  other  Government

committee to ensure that the responsible bodies  should

nominate persons representing particular interests, and

that the final authority lies with the Minister or  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, the Minister has just said that in

his next amendment he is going to change "all" goods to

"any"  goods. But "any goods" could be "all goods".  If

you want to tax "all goods", it is possible to tax "any

goods",  and "any goods" could be "all goods". So  that

the amendment from "all goods" to "any goods" is really

not  very encouraging. My amendment reads "those  goods

recommended by a Tariff Board to be constituted by  the

Minister.  .  .".  I  have  never  suggested  that  the

Government should be the puppet of this body. It should

be   constituted   by   the  Minister,   and   if   the

recommendation  of  the Tariff  Board  is  against  the

interest  of  the  Minister  or  the  Government,   the

Minister   or  the  Government  need  not  accept   it.

Moreover,  this Advisory Committee as  set  up  by  the

Minister  could  be dismissed at any time.  It  is  not

represented  by any particular interest.  The  Minister

simply calls for certain traders and forms a Committee.

That  Committee is obligatory to the Minister,  and  is

not responsible to any particular interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quoting one paragraph at page 27 of Col. Lyle's

Report.  There are two recommendations given  regarding

this Tariff Board. The first one is:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would suggest that you establish the Legislative

framework  for  your  Anti-Dumping Regulations  at  the

earliest   possible  date.  These,   of   course,   are

complementary  and an integral part of  any  protection

granted to industry. One has little effect without  the

other  so, if you will soon be in a position  to  grant

protection to certain industries, it is imperative that

the  appropriate  Anti-Dumping  Regulations  can   be

applied simultaneously."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Minister for Commerce and Industry has

very     faithfully     followed    this     particular

recommendation.  He  has applied some  restrictions  on

Chinese textiles.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> They have been lifted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> The second one is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would suggest that you include four or five

representatives  from industry on the  roster  of  your

Protection  Advisory Committee. I  have  called  on  at

least  ten firms interested in securing Protection  and

without   exception  they  have  made  this  suggestion

forcefully.  They submit that the present  roster,  for

business reasons, is import minded and that a balancing

industrial  point  of  view  on  the  Committee  is   a

necessity  if  the  applications are  to  receive  fair

consideration."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes my point clearer. Of the two

recommendations,  the Minister has  accepted  one.  The

second  recommendation in the Report particularly  says

that the roster - that is the Committee

- which he has formed is import minded. That shows  that

they  have  only one interest. The Hon.  Minister  just

calls  for certain importers and forms a panel, and  he

says that they are the Advisory Committee, and they are

going  to decide the fate of Singapore. We do not  know

whether  they  represent the consumers' interests,  the

local  industrialists or the entrepot traders. What  I

suggest is that if you have a panel, that panel  should

at  least  be  represented by various sections  of  the

people.  That would be satisfactory. But your  Advisory

Committee  is  only  a  Committee composed  of  certain

importers,  and they would never work in the  interests

of other people.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Dealing with the Member for Telok

Ayer  again,  Sir,  he  is in love  with  the  incoming

Government. I hope we will be returned, and he  can  be

in love with us then! The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



final  choice,  he  says, is with the  Government.  But

according  to this amendment, it is not,  and  that  is

what  I  have been trying to point out. Sir, the Member

for  Farrer Park's amendment came in before  mine  did.

Therefore,  he  intended section  11 - clause  3  of  the

original  amending Bill - to stand. That would have  made

section 11 read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There shall be charged, levied and paid such duties

in the Colony as may be prescribed from time to time by

the Governor in Council . . . on goods...".



<br><br>Something  like that. This means that the  Governor  in

Council  would have the power to prescribe and to  levy

duties  on  any  goods.  The  effect  of  the  original

amending Bill would have been that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now under the definition of "goods", the hon. Member

for  Farrer Park seeks to define it in such a way  that

those  goods  shall be only those that are recommended,

and  therefore  if  the Governor in  Council  wants  to

impose  duties  on  tobacco, petroleum  or  liquor,  he

cannot  do so without a recommendation from the  Tariff

Board.  Now  that  is  the position - it  is  a  complete

somersault to what we have now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member for Telok Ayer said the Tariff

Board  will  recommend. That is  exactly  what  I  have

proposed -  that  the  Tariff  Advisory  Committee  will

recommend to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation which the Member for Farrer Park made

just  now is that the Committee does not represent  the

interests  as  set out here. I see a  danger  there.  I

would love to get on the Tariff Advisory Board in  this

fashion.  You  get  three  Chambers  of  Commerce   inevidently that is what the Member for Telok Ayer has in

mind,  that they should represent some groups like  the

Chambers  of  Commerce  and so on.  We  get  the  three

Chambers  of Commerce; we get three manufacturers,  and

we  get three consumers. I do not know whom we can find

from  the  consumers. There is no representative  body,

and it is anybody's guess who is a consumer and who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



is  not. The same claim could be put up by the Chambers

of Commerce. Now, what will happen? You will get a tug-of-war   between   the   importing   interests   (three

representatives) and the manufacturing interests (three

representatives)  with  the consumers  sitting  on  the

fence to be lobbied about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you will see that unless it is recommended by

the  Tariff Board, the Governor in Council will  impose

no duty. He can, of course, refuse because the law does

not  say  "he shall" but "he may". But the chances  are

that  if the Governor in Council wants to impose duties

on  any  goods, he has to refer to the Tariff  Advisory

Board.  Now the Tariff Advisory Board knows  full  well

that the Minister has it in mind to impose such duties,

and therefore he will not refuse if they recommend.  So

they  consider the case and they recommend. As soon  as

the recommendation goes through - it will take probably a

week  or  two before the Governor in Council meets  and

puts  it through-then all the rich people, who  sit  on

the  Tariff Board and who know that duties are  coming,

would love to hoard those goods and become millionaires

overnight.  I would like to get on to such a  Committee

if  I  am  not  a Minister! This House should  see  the

danger of such a position-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> On a point of

information,  Sir, Is it proper for  the  Minister  so

frankly to reveal his baser instincts in this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am not revealing my baser

instincts, Sir, I am just expressing to the  House  how

businessmen would feel when there are opportunities for

making money like that. It is, therefore, dangerous  to

have  a  Board which has interested parties. The  ideal

would  be to have persons who are independent in  their

judgment. Therefore, they should not be drawn from  any

representative  body but from people who  are  able  to

balance  the  good and the bad - the importing  interests

and  manufacturing interests - and to come to conclusions

which  are most beneficial to the economy of Singapore,

as set down in the terms of reference. Their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



deliberations  should be independent of affiliation  to

any  side - the importing or the manufacturing side. That

is  what  I have set up and I have given the  terms  of

reference. I have picked out individuals who I consider

have  integrity and who will be capable  of  exercising

their judgment impartially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was bullied by the Manufacturers' Association:

"most  of  these  people are merchants,  they  are  not

manufacturers." I said to them, "I am not going to  put

you  manufacturers in, because you are the  people  who

would apply. I cannot make you judge your own cases." I

have  not  chosen them as importers, but I have  chosen

them as persons who I think have integrity and who will

consider the cases impartially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have indicated to the hon. Sir Ewen Fergusson

what  I have done and set out in my statement. If  that

can  be  incorporated into the law, I have no objection

to  accepting such an amendment. But this is  something

that goes beyond that and therefore I cannot accept it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 11, to leave out "all" and insert

"any".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a drafting amendment, Sir, in order to do

away with the impression created by the word "all".  In

fact, the definition reads: "dutiable goods" means "all

goods"  in  the old one or "any goods" now, as  I  have

proposed,  which  are subject to the levy  of  a  duty.

Therefore,  the definition is one that is  referred  to



later  in  the  Bill  where the  context  requires  the

definition  to  be applied. For instance;  a  man  with

dutiable goods without authority or without having paid

duty  will  be  fined,  and so on  and  so  forth.  The

definition  is not one that gives the Government  power

to  exercise any duty imposing functions. But in  order

to  remove the misunderstanding, I thought it would  be

better if the word "any" were inserted, and therefore I

made this amendment.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson (Nominated):</b> Sir, the explanatory

statement  giving  the objects and  reasons  says  that

"this Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>



amends  the Customs Ordinance to extend, the  power  to

impose duties to cover all goods". Would it be fair  to

say,  if  the  word "any" had occurred to the  Minister

before, that it would now read "to extend the power  to

impose  duties  to  cover any goods"  and  whether  the

change makes any real difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the explanatory statement is

always in the Bill that is tabled for First Reading  as

the  Bill  stands then. The explanatory statement  does

not  become part of the law when the Bill has  had  its

Third Reading, and therefore it is to be ignored.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was intrigued to hear the

Minister  say  just  now that he thought  it  would  be

better  to change the word "all' to "any". Sir, when  I

was  a  student,  I  was  told that  one  of  the  most

important  functions of a legislature is  to  legislate

accurately  and  precisely, and there are  very  highly

paid and highly skilled persons who make it their lifetime  task to decide whether the word "all" or the word

"any"  should be put in each particular context. May  I

ask  the Minister whether it was, as he stated, his own

thought  that it was better, or had he taken advice  on

that thought?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the word



"all"  is  as  suitable as the word  "any".  I  had  no

objection  to  the  drafting of the original  amendment

when it read "all", because it was a perfectly suitable

word,  and there could be no misunderstanding on  that.

But  because  of  the impression that  was  created  in



certain Chinese papers when they read the word "all", I

suggested to the Attorney-General whether it would  not

be better if we could put some other word. I asked what

about  "any"?  And he said that "any" was  as  good  as

"all" in this context.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, I am still doubtful. Let us

suppose  there  are  twenty items of  goods.  The  Hon.

Minister  comes in with this Ordinance  and  says  "all



goods".  Even if he has amended it to read "any goods",

these twenty items



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



could be taxed. Am I right in assuming that "any goods"

could also mean "all goods"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Would the Attorney-General care to

express his opinion on this technical matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sure the Attorney-General

would  like  to  take this opportunity to  express  his

opinion.  I  would  like to take  this  opportunity  to

dispel  this wrong impression. I think the hon.  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar understands full well, as a  lawyer,

that  this clause is one relating to the definition  in

this Bill, unless the context otherwise requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original expression "dutiable goods" means

intoxicating  liquors, tobacco or  petroleum  on  which

duty  has not been paid. But my first amendment in  the

amending Bill was that "dutiable goods" means all goods

on  which duty has not been paid. It does not mean that

because it is there in the definition that the Governor

in  Council can impose duties. It means that where  the

context  requires,  the definition  will  be  used.  It

means,  in short, that "dutiable goods" shall mean  any

goods  on  which duty has not been paid, and therefore,

if  you come to a clause later on which says that  "any

person  having in his possession dutiable goods without

having paid duty shall be liable to prosecution",  then

the  word "dutiable goods" could apply to any goods  on

which  duty has been imposed under section  11  of  the

Ordinance. It is just a matter of definition. I do  not

see the difficulty there.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Just to make it clear, Sir, that

the  definition, by leaving out "dutiable goods", which

is  restricted  to  intoxicating liquors,  tobacco  and

petroleum and now covers all goods or any goods,  which

we agree seems to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



exactly the same thing - does it mean that section 11  is

the only operative section in the Customs Ordinance and

that  this definition does not mean that the  law  will

now  be that the administration can impose duty on  all

goods because of that definition?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> No, Sir, It

does  not. Sir Ewen Fergusson is right in thinking that

the  important,  operative, section will  still  remain

section 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this curious business between "all" and "any",

although I personally was not consulted, I have thought

about it, and in my opinion "any" is a much better word

to use in this particular context. I cannot take credit

for  the making of the change, because I was not myself

involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, to leave out lines 12 to 16.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is now not necessary. In the original

amending  Bill this was put in because section  11  was

going  to  be  amended  by the inclusion  of  the  word

"goods", which would have given the Governor in Council

the  power  to levy duty on any goods - this, of  course,

should  be read in conjunction with the past definition

on  which  we  have been debating. Sir, section  11  is

going  to  be more defined as to the type of  goods  on

which the Governor in Council can impose duty, that is,

manufactured goods needing protection and  so  on,  and

not  textiles. I think the definition of "goods" is not

necessary any more, and therefore it is deleted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

gives  the Governor in Council the power to  impose

a  duty  on  anything he likes; but, in  accordance

because  of  the fear expressed by the  trade  that

there  might  be  a  misuse of the  powers  by  the

the  present clause by a new clause which gives the

Governor in Council more clearly defined powers.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I move, "That the clause

be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have given sufficient reasons for the

inclusion of this clause, and therefore, it  is  not

necessary for me to elaborate further.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 5, after "Where", to insert "on

consideration of the report of a committee of not less

than  three persons appointed for the purpose  by  the

Minister by notification in the Gazette in respect  of

any goods specified in that notification".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I have that in writing, please?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member does not have extra

copies by any chance?



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Sir, most people who give

serious  thought to the future of Singapore must  have

sighed  with some relief when the Minister gave notice

of  an  amendment to his original proposal  under  the

Customs   Ordinance.  Many  were   startled   at   the

overwhelming powers which were sought and which  would

have armed any Council of Ministers with the right  to

change  the economic structure of Singapore overnight.

I  do not think it is enough to state in a speech that



the  powers would never be used for any such  suicidal

purpose,  for  how binding on future legislatures  are

the present good intentions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When powers are needed, they should be restricted to

the minimum necessary. I congratulate the Minister  on

having   bowed  to  responsible  public  opinion   and

produced  a measure which goes some way to restricting

interference with the free movement of trade to  those

goods  which might be capable of manufacture - and,  we

hope,     efficient    manufacture    in    Singapore.

Nevertheless, there will be certain interference  with

the  movement of trade, and one is concerned about the

restrictions  and  with the difficulties  which  there

will be of policing any goods which come under control

in an island like Singapore.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By restrictions, I mean, Sir, not just duties. It is

a  fact  that once controls are imposed they  tend  to

need  expansion, because evasions are  encouraged  and

then  something  else has got to be  policed.  If  the

administration, no matter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



how well-meaning, is armed with too great powers, they

can be ill-used, because frequently it is the easy way

out. Because the introduction of protective tariffs is

a far more serious matter, in my opinion, than some of

the  other  measures  which have  been  introduced  to

encourage new manufactures in Singapore, I am  anxious

that full opportunity should be given to the public to

consider tariffs before they are introduced.  That  is

why  I  was  prepared to move an amendment making  the

introduction of duties for this purpose subject to  it

being  passed  first by the Legislature  and  not,  as

under  the present proposals, that you put the tariffs

on   first  and  then  argue  about  them  afterwards;

because, even  if  they  were  thrown  out   by   the

Legislature  afterwards,  a  considerable  amount   of

trouble  and  interruption to trade  will  have  taken

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in the case of revenue duties such as

those imposed on tobacco and spirits, it is absolutely

necessary  for the administration to be able  to  move

quickly, suddenly and unexpectedly, because there  are

large  quantities of these goods in bonded warehouses,

and  the  moment there is any hint of an  increase  in

duty, they can be moved immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same considerations do not arise with goods

which   are   being  protected  for  the  purpose   of

manufacture.  Nobody is likely to  be  carrying  large

stocks just ready to defeat the revenue collectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Hon. the Minister when

introducing the Bill indicated he had set up a  Tariff

Advisory Committee and that they would examine any  of

these proposals. That being the case, I feel that,  if

we  are  examined  by this Committee and  that  enough

notice  is  given to the public before the  matter  is

considered by the Governor in Council, that would help

me  to  feel that the administration is tied  down  to

certain limits. For that reason I move this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, this puts into the law the

machinery  that  is  exactly  as  I  have   set   out.

Therefore, I have no objection to this going into  the



law as such.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point that Sir Ewen Fergusson has made in

his  speech,  and  that is the change to  the  economic

structure  of  Singapore overnight. I already  made  it

clear that it was not overnight. I declared it in  1956

that   we   were  considering  it.  It  was  thoroughly

considered.  Also there is no change  in  the  economic

structure by the mere changing in the law. A change  to

an  economic structure can only come by factual changes

in  the  economy. However, Sir, I am prepared to accept

this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,

"That  the  new clause, as amended, be  added  to  the

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, before this is passed, I would

like to make this comment. While I understand perfectly

what   was  the  fear  and  anxiety  behind  Sir   Ewen

Ferguson's  mind,  I do not see how this  adds  to  the

elegance   of  the  clause.  It  becomes  an  extremely

unwieldy  piece  of  legislation.  Before  it   becomes

enshrined in our law, the Attorney-General should prune

it  carefully.  If  he  wants to  give  effect  to  the

intention  in  this phrase, it should at least  be  put

elegantly and succinctly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member late. We have

passed that. We are now on the Question, "That the new

clause, as amended, be to the Bill."

<div align="center"><b>REGISTRATION OF UNITED KINGDOM PATENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>11.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, "That the Bill be



now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's attention has been drawn to the

inadequacy of section 9 of the Registration  of  United

Kingdom  Patents Ordinance, (Chapter 181 of the Revised

Edition), as this section does not afford protection to

patentees  and others in the local Register of  Patents

between   the   date  of  filing  of  the   provisional

application in the United Kingdom and the filing of the

complete specification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the United Kingdom Patents Act, 1907-1946, all

patents based on non-convention applications were dated

as  at  the  date  of  the application  in  the  United

Kingdom.  Under the United Kingdom Patents  Act,  1949,

however, patents are dated as at the date of filing the

complete  specification and some considerable time  may

elapse between the provisional application and the date

of filing the complete specification. Therefore, if the

patentee or others commenced the manufacture or sale of

the  invention in Singapore between the date of  filing

of  the  provisional application in the United  Kingdom

and   the   date   of  the  filing  of   the   complete

specification, the validity of the certificate of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



registration issued locally might be assailable and the

registration might even be invalidated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered desirable, therefore, to give to the

grantee  of the United Kingdom patent or to others  who

commence  the  manufacture or sale of the invention  in

Singapore  between  the  date  of  the  filing  of  the

provisional application in the United Kingdom  and  the

date  of  the  filing  of  the  complete  specification

adequate protection when an application is subsequently

made  for the registration of the United Kingdom patent

locally.  Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to give effect  to

this intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill, which replaces Section 11 of

the  Ordinance,  makes it necessary for particulars  of

the title of the licensee of a patent to be entered  in

the  Register  of Patents and, unless such  particulars

have  been  registered, it shall  not  be  admitted  in

evidence  unless  the  court  otherwise  directs.  This

clause is designed to bring our law into line with  the

corresponding  provisions of  the  law  in  the  United

Kingdom. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is evidence, Sir, that during recent years an

increasing  number of private nursing homes,  maternity

homes and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



private hospitals are being set up. It is necessary  to

promote  legislation for the registration, control  and

supervision  of institutions used for the reception  of

the sick and convalescent, and of premises used for the

reception of pregnant women or women immediately  after

child   birth,   to  ensure  that  these   institutions

subscribe  to standards acceptable and carry  on  under

sanitary conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill follows similar provisions in other

countries, particularly the Public Health Act of  1936,

and  also takes cognizance of provisions under existing

Ordinances, namely the Local Government Ordinance,  the

Singapore Industrial Promotion Board Ordinance, and the

Clerks Employment Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been considered by the Medical Advisory

Council   and   agreed  to  by  the  Local   Government

authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed, from the definition of Local

Authority  in  clause 2, that the Bill is  intended  to

cover the Southern Islands as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Clause 3, the so-called death houses are exempted

from  the  provisions of this Bill. These  houses  will

continue  to be licensed under by-laws made  under  the

Municipal Ordinance or the Local Government Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 provides that the existing maternity homes

and nursing homes, provided they apply within two years

of  the coming into operation of this Ordinance,  shall

be   registered  unconditionally.  The  effect  of  the

provisions  of the Bill are detailed in the explanatory

statement.  I do not think it is necessary  for  me  to

repeat them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.47 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Sir, in clause 3, the main purpose of

this  legislation is to ensure that a certain efficient

standard  is  reached and maintained for the  care  and

treatment of the sick.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is confining

his  comments to clause 3, perhaps the appropriate time

would be in Committee. But if he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



dealing with the general principles of the Bill, then

he can speak now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the hon. Member wishes to speak

on.  If  he  wishes to speak, as I say, on the  general

principles  of the Bill, he can do so now.  But  if  he

wishes  to speak on details of the Bill, such as clause

3, then there will be an opportunity in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> I will speak in Committee, Sir.



<br><br>11.48 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

the Minister will kindly make clear just one point. Why

exclude the dying houses in Sago Lane and-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the remarks I made just a

little  while  ago, in connection with the  Member  for

Farrer Park's attempt to speak, also apply to the  hon.

Member. If the hon. Member is confining his remarks  to

clause  3,  which  deals with "dying" houses  or  dying

persons,  then  I  think the proper  time  will  be  in

Committee. There will be ample opportunity for  him  to

speak  on  this  in Committee. If the  hon.  Member  is

speaking  on  the  general  principles,  that  is,  the

principle  of  registration  of  persons  carrying   on

nursing and maternity homes, and for purposes connected

therewith,  then  he can do so now. But  if  it  is  on

details,  the  hon. Member will have an opportunity  in

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I intend to speak on general

principles. If the Hon. Minister can satisfy me on  the

points  I  raise, I will support the Bill in principle.

In  my  opinion,  the Bill should have been  introduced



much earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremendous increase in population, the housing

shortage  and the inadequate health facilities provided

by  the Government have encouraged private institutions

to  carry  on  for  such purposes.  Why  allow  private

enterprise  to  get  into such important  institutions?

Legislation  to  protect  public  interest  is  vitally

important. Therefore, I heartily support this  Bill  in

principle.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was represented to me, after publication of the

Bill, that there existed some doubt as to whether the

Bill was intended to cover convalescent homes as well.

As stated in the explanatory statement, it is the



intention that convalescent homes are also covered. But

to avoid any doubt on the matter, I move that clause 2

be amended by inserting the words "or convalescing"

after the word "suffering". I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 3 stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> The main purpose of this legislation is

to ensure that a certain efficient standard is reached

in regard to the maintenance of treatment of sick and

pregnant women. Why then should an exemption be granted

under clause 3 in regard to the place used for the

reception of the sick and the dying, licensed under the

by-laws of the Local Government Ordinance, 1957?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Municipal Ordinance - I quote the

Sick House by-laws:



<br><br>"Clause 12



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sick receiving house shall be licensed as such

unless   there   is  a  Visiting  Medical  Practitioner

attached  to the Staff. The Medical Practitioner  shall

visit at least once a day.



<br><br>Clause 13



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the caretaker, the sick receiving

house  shall  have  such  nursing  staff  as  shall  be

required  by  the  Health Officer, and  stated  on  the

licence."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when you have these conditions, naturally these

houses  come up to the level of ordinary hospitals  and

clinics.  But  there  is nobody to inspect  these  sick

houses  to  see  whether  they  really  engage  nurses,

midwives,  or whether any medical practitioner  really

visits the place. According to the Ordinance, they must

visit  the  place,  but nobody seems  to  care  whether

anyone really visits the place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to know is why the Government should

spend   such   a  lot  of  money  on  various   medical

institutions and leave such a place as a sick house  as

a blot on the dignity and health services of Singapore.

Could  we  not  have one or two wards  from  any  other

hospital attached, for the care of the sick and  dying?

Sir, I have heard that we had about 30 or 33 years  ago

two  wards  attached to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital  for

the care of the sick and dying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is no more place like that, except that

certain  people, being given licences for this purpose,

are,  in fact, running on a commercial basis. According

to  the  Municipal Ordinance, they must have a licence,

but they are not under control by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council seems not worried at all as to what

is  happening in these sick and death houses. In  fact,

nobody  seems  to  worry over that.  Could  we  not  do

something  at  least  for  these  unfortunate   people?

Government  can give them some other place to  build  a

building  for  the  care of the sick  and  dying.  When

people are sick and are really dying, that is the  time

they  need care and comfort more than the ordinary sick

people. How



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



does  a  sick  man, who knows he cannot be cured,  feel

being  dumped  in a place where no attention  is  being

given, either by the City Council or the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest - and this is not an amendment - that the

Government  should at least look into this  matter  and

see  that some free land outside the town area be given

to  those people who manage these sick houses to put up

a  building which, although it may not be up to medical

standards,  could  at  least,  to  a  certain   extent,

preserve the dignity of our City, and at the same time,

give some comfort to the sick and dying.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim Cher Kheng? I understand the

hon. Member wished to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want the

Hon. Minister to explain and I will see if I can accept

it. I reserve my speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason for excluding

death houses is specifically to allow the City Council,

which has for many years been doing it, to continue  to

grant licences for such premises at its own discretion,

since  it has its own by-laws under the Ordinance.  The

City  Council will be in a position to assess the  need

for continuing the death houses or to do away with them

and licensing them entirely under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of visiting the place is purely within

the  responsibility of the City Council. If I find that

the  City Council is not undertaking its work, I  will,

of course, consider the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, regarding the death houses,

I  wish  to  add to the objections raised by  the  hon.

Member  for  Farrer  Park. The  death  houses  are  now

becoming an eye-sore in the eyes of Singapore.  It  may

be  a  fascinating scene for the tourists, but I  would

emphasise  that it is an eye-sore to the residents  who

stay  near these death houses. The Minister for  Health

said that these houses have been controlled by the City

Council  for years, but he should weigh the  fact  that

the  population of Singapore, particularly in  the  so-called Chinatown area, has tripled since the years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



he  referred  to. A few death houses are  a  few  death

houses. How much profit the proprietors of these houses

make  I do not know, but at least the facilities  could

be  improved  now  that  these places  are  visited  by

tourists.  If  I am not mistaken, a few  days  ago  the

local  Press  announced that pictures  of  these  death

houses  will appear on T.V. in America, as they  are  a

centre of attraction for tourists.



<br><br>12.00 noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I support the suggestion of the Member for

Farrer  Park that it is time for Government to  take  a

close  look  to see whether there is any need  for  any

more  death houses. You can imagine ten persons  living

in  a  small  room in the congested area of  Chinatown.

Then  suddenly one of them gets seriously ill  and  the



doctor  says that the patient has no chance to recover.

What happens if the patient has no money and where will

he be put?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the Minister for Health will consider this

problem  seriously and find a solution.  Do  not  leave

this so-called baby in the hands of the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the

sentiments expressed by the Member for Changi and I can

assure him that all consideration will be given to  the

points that he has raised. But on the question of doing

away  with the death houses or their improvement,  this

is  a  matter, of course, for the City Council  at  the

moment. On the question of improvements, I am not aware

that the City Council is not doing its duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of the death houses being

the  target for television and so forth, I am sure that

this   matter  will  be  considered  by  the   Minister

responsible for the granting of facilities to tourists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Is it not proper for the Minister

to write a letter to the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Legislation is not done by letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4-



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on further consideration

of representations made to me by certain medical

practitioners, age should not be the major

consideration in determining whether a person is fit or

otherwise to carry on or to be employed at a Home, and

I consider that infirmity more than age will affect a

person's fitness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accordingly move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, line 5, to leave out "age" and insert

"infirmity".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>LAW REFORM (FRUSTRATED</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>CONTRACTS) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Common Law principle that a person, who has

bound  himself  by a contract to do something,  cannot

escape  liability for damages even though the contract

becomes impossible for him to perform has in days gone

by  led  to  hardships  and  even  in  some  cases  to

absurdities.  The  doctrine that on frustration  of  a

contract,  by impossibility of performance,  the  loss

lies  where it falls, is misleading and often  unjust.

It is wrong to have a position where no adjustment can

be made after the moment of frustration of a contract.

In equity each particular case should be dealt with on

its  own merits and facts, and that is what this  Bill

seeks  to  establish  for all contracts  except  those

special types mentioned in subsection (5) of clause 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For strictly mercantile contracts, the principles of

this Bill already apply by reason of section 5 of  the

Civil Law Ordinance which imports the English Law  for

mercantile and similar purposes into Singapore, and so

gives  effect to the Frustrated Contracts Act of  1943

of the United Kingdom on which this Bill is based.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will give general application to the

modern  principles of the United Kingdom,  1943,  Act,

which  the  Federation of Malaya has already  adopted,

and will enable the Courts to make adjustments between

parties to a contract that can no longer be continued.

In  some respects it will re-establish a principle  of

ancient  Roman Law in which a doctrine of  restitution

found favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill provides in substance that all

sums  paid  before  the  frustrating  event  shall  be

recoverable or, if not paid shall cease to be payable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



But  this  general  right  may  be  qualified  in  the

discretion of the Court if the party to whom the money

is  payable,  or  has been paid, has himself  incurred

expenses in the performance of the contract. If he has

received  payment,  he may be allowed  to  retain  the

whole  or  part  of what he has received;  if  he  has

received  nothing  he may be allowed  to  recover  the

whole  or  part of any expenses to which he  is  being

put.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision for the adjustment of benefits, expenses,

and  cost of work done, is made in subsection  (3)  of

clause  2,  but excluding contracts of insurance.  The

further  provisions in clause 2 provide in  subsection

(4)  that  in  assessing expenses the Court  may  have

regard  to  overhead charges and  cost  of  work,  but

subsection  (5)  expressly  excludes  money  paid  for

insurance - that   is  not  to  be   included   in   the

computation or assessment or reassessment of values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 starts by providing that the Bill, when

enacted,  will  apply  to  contracts,  the   time   of

discharge of which is on or after the first of January

this  year. It goes on to provide that the Bill  binds

the  Crown, and allows a freedom to contract-out. This

is  desirable  because  if in  a  particular  contract

special provision is made for the event of frustration

then  that  special  provision made  in  the  contract

should supervene, and the provisions of this Bill will

be unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain types of contract are expressly excluded,

notably charter-parties and insurance and contracts to

which  a  section  of the Sale of Goods  Act  applies.

Those  Sale of Goods contracts which are excluded  are

agreements  for the sale of specific goods  where  the

goods  perish without any fault on the part of  either

the  seller  or  the  buyer.  Insurance  is  expressly

excluded,  partly because, by the very nature  of  the

contract,  it  is not right that there should  be  any

adjustment if the event insured against does  in  fact

happen. If a person insures against sickness, say,  on

the  1st  January, and if on the 1st February of  that

same  year falls sick, or dies, it would not be right,

having  regard  to  the  risk  run  by  the  insurance

company,  to  let him receive back 11/12ths  of  the

premium that he paid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which was published on 12th December has

not,  so  far  as I know, been adversely criticised  by

anyone. It has the support of the Bar Committee and  of

the Trade Advisory Council, and I have no hesitation in

commending it to this House.

Federation of Malaya, it was no longer possible for him

to continue on this basis. His post has been renamed

Auditor-General, Federation of Malaya, and the former

Singapore Deputy Director of Audit has now been renamed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to proceed with

this Bill. I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a short Bill, and its purpose is to give

effect to the understanding reached during the

Constitutional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



Conference  in  the United Kingdom last  year  on  the

future status of the United Kingdom Services' lands  in

Singapore.  It was then agreed that the United  Kingdom

Services  should  retain  the land  they  occupied  for

defence  purposes, and that there should be established

by  legislation a Services' Lands Board  and  that  the

titles  for  land  paid for by  or  on  behalf  of  the

Services should be vested in this Board. The Board will

also maintain a register of lands made available by the

Singapore Government, and any such lands will revert to

the Singapore Government on becoming surplus to Service

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board would also have the right to acquire

further  land  in accordance with agreed constitutional

process,  or to dispose of surplus land under title  on

condition  that  such land should  be  offered  to  the

Singapore Government in the first instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement was also reached regarding the assets

created  by the Services on land owned by the Singapore

Government  but  made  available to  the  Services  for

defence purposes and which subsequently became surplus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, therefore, consequently creates a

Board  which will administer, within the terms  of  the

Agreement reached in London, all the lands used by  the

Services  in Singapore. The individual clauses  of  the

Bill  are straightforward, and I do not think they call

for any particular comment. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

have some information

on  this  Bill. Would it be possible for the  Hon. the

Chief Secretary to inform the House of the area of land

at  present occupied and held by the Services? How much

is being used by them? Is there any surplus?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second piece of information I would like to seek,

Sir,  is whether the land which is now occupied by  the

Services has been paid for by the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



Kingdom  Government. Has it been lent or  has  it  been

given  for free use by the Colony of Singapore? I  wish

to have some information on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is this. If the land has been paid

for by the United Kingdom Government, then it will be a

Board  constituted by them, because the land  does  not

belong  to  us.  If the land belongs to  us,  then  the

Singapore  Government has the right  to  form  its  own

Board.  I am not able to understand myself. May I  make

my  question clearer? If the land which is now occupied

by  the  Services  has  been paid  for  by  the  United

Kingdom,  then  the land belongs to the United  Kingdom

Government.  If that is so, the Board will be  entirely

composed  of  members  of the  Services.  I  want  some

information, as I do not know anything about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr David, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, as to the factual information for

which  the hon. Member for Telok Ayer has asked,  I  am

afraid  I  have not the details at my disposal  now.  A

review  is being made of all the lands now occupied  by

the  Services with a view to implementing the terms  of

the  Agreement  which I outlined in moving  the  Second

Reading of this Bill. There is a certain amount of land

occupied  by  the Services and paid for by  the  United

Kingdom   Government.   That  land   falls   into   two

categories:  land which has been purchased  by  private

treaty from former owners. That land at present is held

under   title  in  the  name  of  the  Chief  Secretary

Incorporated, because the United Kingdom  Services  had

no  entity  in Singapore capable of holding  land.  The

bulk  of  the  land, however, occupied by  the  Defence

Services  in Singapore and which was paid  for  by  the

U.K. Government was acquired under the Land Acquisition

Ordinance  at  the expense of the U.K. Government.  The

land  so  acquired  will have become  Crown  land,  and

therefore,  there is no title at present in  issue  for

that  land.  But it is proposed that titles  should  be

issued  for that land when the review to which  I  have

referred has been completed.

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>2.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have His Excellency's recommendation that this

Bill, which was read the First time on the 12th of

December last, be proceeded with. I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to improve the bankruptcy

law which largely follows an English Act of 1883. Since

1888,  when the present Bankruptcy Ordinance came  into

force,  amendments have been made on several occasions,

but  although based on the law of England, we have  not

kept  pace  with  certain  important  changes  made  in

England  by  the Acts of 1914 and 1926. These  are  the

Acts  referred to in the Comparative Table  printed  at

the end of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also certain anomalies which it would be as

well to remove and this Bill seeks to bring the law up

to date, and to tighten up the penal provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



of the Ordinance with a view to deterring persons

minded to defraud their creditors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although bankruptcy is a technical and complicated

branch of the law, the general principle is well known.

It  is to keep a fair and even balance between a debtor



who cannot pay his debts and his creditors, and between

the creditors themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, under the Bankruptcy Ordinance, a debtor

commits  an  act  of bankruptcy if execution  has  been

levied  by  seizure of his property where  a  judgment,

including  costs, is for an amount exceeding $500.  But

there is a difficulty in that a creditor cannot present

a  petition  unless  his  debt amounts  to  $500.  This

anomaly  will be removed by the first part of clause  2

of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other alterations in clause 2 are designed to

equate the effects of final orders and final judgments.

It  is a technical difference which at present can only



be  overcome by costly proceedings. The distinction was

removed in the English law some considerable time  ago,

and  it  is an anachronistic anomaly that ought  to  be

removed here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next clause, clause 3, Sir, merely corrects an

error  in  the  present  law.  There  is  no  Assistant

Registrar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 will give the Registrar jurisdiction to

conduct  routine examinations without the necessity  of

such examinations having to be conducted by a judge.  A

similar  amendment was made in 1955 to another  section

of  the Ordinance which gave the Registrar jurisdiction

to  take the public examination of a debtor, but  there

will  here,  as there is in the section 17 to  which  I

referred,  be power for an examination to be  adjourned

by the Registrar for consideration by a judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 deals with priority debts and the effect of

this  will  be to add to rates, income tax  and  wages,

which  are  now given preference, amounts  due  to  the

Central  Provident Fund, if those amounts  have  become

payable within 12 months of the receiving order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next clause reduces the period of relation back

of  the  Official  Assignee's  title  to  a  bankrupt's

property. It is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



uncommon  for debtors, on the eve of their  bankruptcy,

to  attempt  to defraud their creditors by transferring

their property to others. This cannot be allowed and so

there   is  provision  in  the  law  for  the  Official

Assignee's  title to relate back to a period  prior  to

the    actual    operation   of   ordinary   bankruptcy

proceedings.  It  has been found in  practice  that  12

months is too long and sometimes inequitable, and  this

clause proposes that it should be changed to six months

next  preceding  the  date of the presentation  of  the

bankruptcy petition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment that will be made by clause 7 will

enable  the  Official Assignee to recover assets  where

there  has  been an improper preference of a surety  or

guarantor.  This is in effect related to  the  previous

amendment  that  I  have  referred  to,  where  it   is

sometimes  possible  for a bankrupt  to  give  a  wrong

preference  to  persons by judicious disposing  of  his

property immediately before he goes bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next clause merely sets out what is the existing

practice.   It  will  formally  relieve  the   Official

Assignee from personal liability for costs and expenses

in  respect  of  work he does in the discharge  of  his

official duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9, which is the next part of the Bill, does a

variety  of things relating to the penal provisions  of

the  Bankruptcy Ordinance, and is an endeavour to bring

them up to date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a figure of $25 mentioned in section 110 of

the  present Bankruptcy Ordinance which limits offences

by  debtors.  It is at the present time no  offence  to

conceal  or remove property to the value of  only  $25.

That  is a provision which has existed since 1888,  and



it  is considered high time that the limit be increased

from  $25  to $100. True there is an offence,  morally,

however  small  the  amount involved,  but  it  is  not

practicable  for  the  Official  Assignee  to   concern

himself  with minor evasions by concealment or  removal

where the property is of very small value, and $100  is

considered to be a reasonable amount at which  to  draw

the line.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found in practice that sometimes debtors

can   avoid  penal  provisions  under  this  particular

section by delaying their presentation of petitions for

four  months, which is the period at present  specified

in  this  section. It is proposed that this  should  be

enlarged  to  12  months  and  the  deletion   of   the

expression  "or the service of a debtor's summons  upon

him"  mentioned  in  paragraph 4 of  this  clause  will

prevent  the  enlarging of the  period  by  the  debtor

making use of the inevitable delay in the obtaining and

issue of a judgment debtor's summons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth paragraph of this clause substitutes a new

paragraph  for  an existing one -(m)- and  amplifies  the

existing  provisions by making it  an  offence  for  an

undischarged bankrupt to obtain credit to the extent of

$100  or upwards if he does not inform the person  from

whom  he  obtains the credit that he is an undercharged

bankrupt. This is extended to cases of obtaining credit

jointly  with  other persons. A further change  is  the

introduction  of  a  new offence of engaging  in  trade

under  a  name  other  than that  under  which  he  was

adjudged bankrupt without disclosing that all-important

name under which he became a bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining paragraphs make comparatively minor

improvements, and I will mention only one, (xiv), which

relates  to the taking of goods in pawn. At present,  a

pawnbroker  who receives goods from a bankrupt  knowing

that the goods have been pawned in order to defraud the

bankrupt's creditors can be proceeded against  only  by

invoking  the  provisions of  the  Penal  Code.  It  is

thought   that   for   simplicity  of   procedure   and

administrative convenience it is better to enshrine the

necessary   provisions  in  the  Bankruptcy   Ordinance

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 contains two new sections which overlap

with  existing  provisions which will  be  repealed  by

clause  12. They are provisions regarding the  engaging

in  trade without keeping accounts and the question  of

punishment is made more flexible by being changed  from

three  months' imprisonment to a maximum of two  years'

imprisonment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



which is almost certainly desirable, or the possibility

of  the infliction of a fine. This is an offence  which

is  quite  prevalent and it is thought to  need  severe

punishment  in  most cases but there  are  occasionally

cases where a fine would be more appropriate, and  that

will be possible when this amendment is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 110 (B) will replace provisions

relating  to the obtaining of credit or the contracting

of  a  debt without a reasonable expectation  of  being

able  to pay. Here again the penalty is increased  from

three months to two years - as the maximum penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 will amend the existing Ordinance to limit

the  application  of  the Ordinance  to  bankrupts  and

persons  in  respect of whose estates receiving  orders

have been made and will make a bankrupt punishable  for

causing or conniving at the levying of execution on his

property  with intent to defraud his creditors.  It  is

obviously  desirable that if a person connives  at  or,

perhaps, as has happened in some cases instigates,  the

levying  of execution on his property by a creditor  he

likes to the disadvantage of a creditor he dislikes, it

is  quite clear that there is an injustice that  should

be made punishable if it can be discovered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last clause, as I have said, repeals provisions

which will be covered by the two new sections 110 (A)

and 110 (B).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the



Governor's  consent to proceed with  this  Bill  and  I

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill, Sir, cannot be put in more

excellent  words than in the statement I made  to  this

House  on 10th September, 1958. I shall read out  those

portions   in  the  statement  which  relate   to   the

introduction of this Bill. It is from Hansard  of  10th

September, 1958, columns 689 and 690:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Government realises that the working man and woman

in Singapore has up to now had very little opportunity

or incentive to actively participate in the ownership

of industries and to benefit therefrom. Government

therefore feels that it is not only necessary but also

the duty of an elected Socialist Government to actively

assist the people in owning and opening some industries

which are profitable because they produce goods needed

by the vast majority of the population. Such ownership

should not be by the State with public funds but rather

directly by the people on an individual basis so that

every individual shareholder benefits directly from the

profits."



<br><br>It goes on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to organize the working man and woman for

the  new  role  of  industrial  ownership,  a  People's

Investment  Corporation will be set up with  shares  at

$10 each to enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



every working man and woman to participate by owning at

least  one $10 share. In order that the corporation  is

really  an  organization  of  the  people  and  is  not

monopolised by a few big shareholders, no person  shall

be allowed to hold more than 50 shares."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in short, was the purpose of the introduction

of this Bill at the last sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as it stands, provides for an authorised

capital   of  $10  million  divided  into  one  million

ordinary shares of $10 each. The holding of the  shares

is limited to not more than 50 shares to be held by one

individual and, in order that a check is kept  that  no

person  holds  more  than  50 shares  under  fictitious

names,  the  identity card numbers are required  to  be

stated  on the applications, and they will be shown  on

the  register and share certificates. Subject  to  this

restriction,  the shares shall be transferable  in  the

market.  In case of a loss to the people who are  going

to  invest in this Corporation and who would presumably

come  from  the  middle class and lower  class  earning

group - because this Corporation is intended  to  give

them  an  opportunity to invest money in an  industrial

enterprise  which  is  considered  profitable  by   the

Government - all shares shall be guaranteed by Government

at  par. The issue of shares shall be at the discretion

of   the  Board  of  Directors  in  amounts  which  are

considered to be necessary but they are not  to  exceed

the  authorised capital. That means that the  Directors

can  float  shares  to the number that  they  think  is

desirable for any particular venture, but the total  of

such  floatation at different times should  not  exceed

$10 million, and all issues shall rank equally with one

another so that there will be no preferential treatment

of one issue over a later or an earlier issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a limitation in the Bill placed on the

investment  of the funds of this Corporation,  and  the

limitation  is  that the Corporation shall  invest  its

funds  in  industrial  ventures  only  on  the  written

invitation of the Industrial Promotion Board. Now  this

safeguard  has been put in because it is possible  that

the Directors might venture to invest in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



fields  which might not prove to be profitable  because

there    has    not   been   sufficient   investigation

beforehand.  Consequently, this  is  to  safeguard  the

poor   man  who  is  likely  to  own  shares  in   this

Corporation.  Of course, in case where the  Corporation

holds  funds surplus to its requirements for investment

in  industrial purposes, the Directors will have  power

to  invest such surplus funds in gilt-edged securities.

The  word  "gilt-edged" is not specified as  such.  The



words  used  in  the  Bill are "trustee  securities  or

placed on deposit in banks". Therefore, there need  not

be  any  idle capital lying with the Corporation  which

may  not  earn  any income but, of course,  the  income

from  such  investment would be  limited  to  the  rate

obtained for such type of investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards the control of this Corporation, it

is proposed that the Chairman shall be nominated by the

Minister,   that  the  Minister  shall  appoint   three

Directors  for varying periods, and that  the  Chairman

and  these three Directors shall form the initial Board

of  Directors. They shall have powers to carry out  all

deeds  and acts pertaining to the good conduct  of  the

Corporation  and  its investments. But the  Corporation

shall  hold  a general meeting within one year  of  its

incorporation, unless it is proved to the  satisfaction

of  the Minister that, due to unforeseen circumstances,

an  extension is necessary, in which case the  Minister

can  extend the period by a further year. At this first

annual  general meeting, the shareholders  shall  elect

three Directors, and after such elections, the Board of

Directors  shall  be  composed of the  Chairman,  three

appointed Directors and three elected Directors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation will also be empowered to nominate

such  number  of its Directors as is necessary  on  the

Board  of  other companies in which it is participating

with capital, but, of course, the Chairman shall always

be a nominee on such Boards of participating companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the control in the general meeting does

not go to persons who are bent on trying to get control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



in their hands, a further stipulation limits the number

of  proxies  that any shareholder may  hold,  and  that

limit   is  placed  at  20  so  that  manipulation   by

shareholders interested in gaining control cannot conic

about  because no person can represent more than 20  as

proxy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first step, and I think a unique

step, to bring the people of Singapore into partnership

in  industrial expansion. But, as has been announced in

my  statement, as a first stage the Government proposes

that  this Corporation should participate only  in  the

cigarette  industry and the matches industry,  because,

on  investigation, I am satisfied and so is the Manager

of the Industrial Promotion Board -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Certainly, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Assuming the Bill is passed today,

could the Minister tell us how long he expects it to be

before this Corporation begins to participate in  these

industries?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the length of time before

this  Corporation starts participating depends,  first,

on  the amount of support the Corporation gets from the

people  of  Singapore;  secondly,  it  depends  on  the

negotiations  that  have to be finalised  with  outside

manufacturers,  if  they wish  to  come  in,  before  a

cigarette   venture  is  started.  Therefore,   it   is

difficult  for  me at this stage to give  any  definite

indication of the period of time that will be required.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a further point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I think, Sir, the Member can

speak  when  I have finished, and I will reply  to  him

then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying - before the hon. Member disturbed my

trend  of  thought - this is the first step in Singapore

where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>



the  people  are asked to participate in  Singapore's

industrial  expansion  and  in  ventures  which   are

considered to be safe investments and profitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Socialist Parties and individuals profess

a desire to bring about Socialist policies and so on.

This  is  not  "Socialist"  in  the  sense  that  the



Government controls a particular industry. When  they

say  a  socialised  industry, they  mean  normally  a

nationalised industry - an industry that  is  owned  or

run by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a genuine effort to get the people of

Singapore, the common man or woman in the street,  to

participate in profitable ventures. It can be termed.

Sir,  a democratised socialist venture. I am not good



at  coining  such words - the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

is, and I am sure the Minister for Communications and

Works is equal to him in that respect. But I, Sir, am

not a politician by-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Nature!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Not by nature, but by

inclination; neither am I a politician by profession.

Therefore, I confess I am not up to arguing with  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar about terms of that  sort.

However, when this Corporation is initiated, I  hope,

and  I  am  almost sure, that the people of Singapore

will meet it with the confidence that it deserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry has said,  it

is a unique step, and the Government, after 3½ years

in  office,  is making a genuine effort to  help  the

working man and working woman in Singapore. But  what

I  cannot  understand is why this Bill, if it  is  so

good, was not introduced much earlier when the Labour

Front Coalition Government came into power?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know the tragic events during the last 3½

years  which  have proved to the people of  Singapore

that the Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



Front  Coalition Government is not in a  position  to

run the affairs of the country efficiently. This

Bill is very beautifully put up and introduced by the

Minister for Commerce and Industry. I am referring to

clause 5 (2) at page 2 which says : -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All shares of the Corporation are hereby guaranteed

at par by the Government."



<br><br>The  Minister has just informed the House  that  this

Bill  is  helping the working man and working  woman.

Such  people  are going to invest their money  earned



through  sweat. They are going to invest in, say,  50

shares   at  $10  each  in  this  Corporation.   Will

Government  guarantee  a return  of  profit?  If  the

Minister  is  so  sure of making money  out  of  this

Corporation, it may as well guarantee a profit. If  a

person  puts money in the bank, Sir, he can at  least

get  4 per cent interest. Today, the people may  have

money to invest in the Corporation, but tomorrow they

may  need  the  money, in which case  can  Government

accept the surrendering of the shares and pay back to

the investor the money he has invested?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no quarrel with Government's intention

to  help the working man and working woman. I am here

to  see that their interests are protected, and  that

their money is not lying idle in the Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know that, if you put in, say, $500 today

and you withdraw it after 10 years, that $500 will be

of  no  use?  Sir, $1,000 was a very big sum  prewar.

Today, you insure a person's life for $1,000.  After



10  or 15 years, when you get the money back from the

insurance company, it is worth only $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am very concerned with is this-if the

Government  is  sincere in its  effort  to  help  the

people, it must make it plain to them that their hard-earned money will be protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is indeed a unique step.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I were to

run  an  essay  competition on "How to  interest  the

people  of Singapore in industrialisation",  I  would

award the Minister for Commerce and Industry the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



first  prize. I think this is one of his bright  ideas - it

is worth a debate, certainly worth looking into, and most

certainly will come to nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent some time, not long ago, in 1957, discussing

the  $1 million Singapore Industrial Promotion Board.  It

has come to nought. At that time we were told how the  $1

million,  by  a series of geometrical progression,  would

lead  to investments worth millions of dollars. It  seems

one  lends  $1 million; the part paid back  is  lent  out

again; it comes in one end and goes out the other end, so

that  although the capital investment is only $1 million,

yet  in effect the total stimulus given to industry would

be worth many millions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see from the Press that the Chairman of the Board,

who  was  connected with the Manufacturers'  Association,

has relinquished his post. I have asked the Minister just

now  how  long it was before he expected to  do  anything

about  this  Bill, provided it is passed  today  and  the

Governor gives his assent at the earliest possible  date.

He  knows,  as  well as we do, that at  the  outside  his



Government  has  got up to the 2nd July  to  do  anything

about  it. Nobody is likely to get anything going  within

the  time  at his disposal. We are just arguing a  purely

hypothetical  and  academic  Bill  for  the  purpose   of

satisfying  the  ego  of the Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to argue on this purely academic Bill to its

academic  conclusions, may I ask him, before  I  proceed,

just  how  he proposes to prevent a person from capturing

control,  beneficial control and not nominal control,  of

more than 50 shares? The Schedule says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall be permitted to hold more than fifty

shares  and  no  further  shares  shall  be  allotted  or

transferred to any person who already holds fifty  shares

in the Corporation."



<br><br>It does not say anywhere that no person shall pot hold 50

shares  in trust for somebody else. Therefore I can  well

go  and  round up 5,000 people, and get each to  hold  50

shares each in trust for me. There is no law against this

and,  therefore,  if his Investment Corporation  and  his

cigarette factory are a roaring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



success,  far from the Minister making large  numbers  of

people    becoming   small   property-owning   democratic

supporters of the Singapore People's Alliance, he will be

creating   a  situation  in  which  a  great  number   of

speculators and racketeers will pounce on the shares they

have captured the beneficial control of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, be that as it may, in principle, I expect it is

as  good  as any of the schemes which his Government  has

thought  out.  How do we get votes? By putting  money  in

people's  pockets! How do we put money in  their  pockets

when they do not have confidence in us? Take public funds

and  guarantee  that they would not lose the  money.  But

then,  as  the  Member  for Tiong  Bahru  says,  why  not

guarantee  a profit too? I am quite sure the imaginative

Minister for Commerce and Industry did not think this one

out. Had he thought of it earlier-



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I had!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He had indeed! Then he might very

well  have  forestalled the question put to  him  by  the

Member for Tiong Bahru.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a matter of practical politics, the Minister

knows  well that this is just another statute which  will

lie  quietly on the Statute Book. He can do nothing about

it, and if he does, he may come to grief!



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this House must

indeed be very pleased to witness today two major Parties

denounce   Socialist   economic  policies.   The   P.A.P.

yesterday said that as long as the economic situation  of



Indonesia and the Federation of Malaya remains unchanged,

they  are not supporting any major changes. And  now  the

Minister for Commerce and Industry stands up to say  that

this  project,  which  we  are now  debating,  is  not  a

Socialist measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about industrialisation, I wonder whether you

have  been  disturbed sometimes by any foreign  visitors.

When the visitor pesters you to take him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



round  Singapore, and you bring him up to Mount  Faber,

you will have a nice view of the whole of Singapore  at

your   feet.  And  the  most  striking  scene  is   the

harbour - with  so  many ships - yet  not  even  a  smoking

chimney which is indicative of an industrial city. This

is  the  industrial  effort which all  politicians  are

shouting about highly!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, at least the Minister for Commerce and

Industry  honestly tried to put up  a  scheme.  I  will

agree  with the criticism that the life of the  present

Government is too short to give effect to this  scheme,

but  at  least the Minister's purpose and determination

is good and the scheme is worth considering. The leader

of the P.A.P. should follow this example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who thought of this scheme are honest because

they  were elected on the socialist platform. They have

promised  to provide every opportunity for the  people.

So  even  in  the last few hours which they have,  they



want to work out a scheme to provide an opportunity  to

the  people to participate in a business venture.  They

are  not like so many selfish socialist leaders who are

extremists and only know how to strike and strike until

all  the  factories are shut down. Then they  will  say

that  until we merge with the Federation of  Malaya  we

cannot solve our problems. They only talk and talk, and

come to this Assembly and blabber, blabber, blabber-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the hon. Member

did  say  "blabber" and not "blubber". I do think  that

"blabber" is not quite a parliamentary word to  use  in

this   Assembly.  I  ask  him  to  withdraw  the   word

"blabber".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I will obey your order. I

beg  to  withdraw  the word. Sir,  in  principle,  this

project  has  won my hearty support, and I  assure  you

that  the  working class, the masses, will  open  their

eyes and judge for themselves whether the Minister  for

Commerce and Industry is doing the right thing  or  the

wrong thing, and whether he will succeed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



or  not.  Anyway, this scheme is an attempt to  provide

for  more  jobs, and what is more important,  that  the

Minister  has  the courage to challenge the  import  or

business houses which have long been monopolised by the

Europeans.  Sir, the task is big but the  Minister  has

the courage to undertake this project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the speech which the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry  has  just delivered,  there  are  a  few

important  points  where I am sure  he  has  failed  to

convince  us. The first point is whether  he  can  tell

this  House  when this project can really be  put  into

effect.  Secondly,  even if we start manufacturing  our

own  cigarettes, will the Minister prohibit the  import

of any foreign-made cigarettes into Singapore? Thirdly,

will this restriction affect one of our main sources of

revenue?  So  I  hope  the Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry  can give us a detailed explanation  of  these

three points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support the Member for Tiong Bahru when he

says  that Government has a duty to give assurances  to

the investor, especially as it is the Government itself

which  intends to invite the lower income group  to  be

shareholders.  I  sincerely  hope  the   Minister   for

Commerce  and Industry will also give us a satisfactory

reply to this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish the Minister can inform us whether,

since  he first brought out his idea about this  scheme

in   this  House,  ally  preparations  have  been  made

regarding the recruitment of workers, the purchase  and

installation of machinery, etc., because you must  have

a  blue-print of your plan in your Ministry. It is high

time  for  you  to let us know in detail  the  type  of

preparatory work you have done.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that I am in

possession of the secrets of the Ministry. Perhaps  the

hon.  Member  has forgotten that he is  addressing  the

Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. Another

point - it  looks as if it is too much for  the  Minister

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



Commerce  and  Industry  to give any  assurance - how  much

confidence has he, and what method does he intend to  use

to change the smoking habits of our people here? There is

a piece of information supplied by the Hon. the Financial

Secretary  in answer to a question (No. 2) on  the  Order

Paper  of 21st January, 1959 - that is the average  monthly

releases,  by  grades of cigarettes from  bond  in  1958.

There are so many different grades - Grades D, C, B, B1 and

A - and  I  am  sure  all hon. Members  will  discover  the

differences in choice. Grade B is far bigger than all the

other brands put together. This shows that the smokers in

Singapore have their own choice. For example, Grade B  is

165,712 pounds compared with Grade D which is only 76,190

pounds, and Grade A is 42,857 pounds. We come now to  the

prices. There are also great differences. Grade D, c.i.f.

per  1,000 sticks is $7.50 and less than $10.50  compared

with  Grade B which, as I have just quoted, has a  bigger

sale  and  which is $13.50 and less than  $15.  Sir,  all

these differences show that there is a connection between

the  sale  of  cigarettes and the choice of the  smokers.

Therefore,  what  are  the  grounds  for  the  Minister's

confidence,  and  what are his methods  for  implementing

this project, if he is so sure that the project will meet

with success?



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is another Bill

which-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We will have to foot!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> as the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar

has said, will remain on the Statute book and nothing

more. It is a mere waste of time to speak on this.

However, a warning is very necessary to the public. It is

a stunt. Am I in order to say "stunt", Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps, as the hon. Member is

rising on a point of order on himself, I had better  rule

that "stunt" is out of order. Please withdraw it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you for the guidance, Sir. I

withdraw it. It is a political stuff which is not  easily

consumed  by the public. At the outset, it has been  said

that the scheme is to help the poor man in getting into a

venture  or industry and making a profit out  of  it.  In

case  of loss, this Government, or any future government,

will guarantee to pay the money back. He can within three

months get his money back. That is the safeguard. But  as

my  friend  and colleague on this side of the House,  the

hon. Member for Tiong Bahru, has said, if a poor man  has

saved his well-earned money by hard labour, he expects  a

return.  But  after years and years of investment,  there

may be no returns. In case of a loss in business, he gets

back  his capital; but where is his profit? You  may  put

your  money in a savings bank for so many years  and  you

can  expect to double it. You put in an insurance  policy

and  you  may get a return after some years. But in  this

scheme there is no such guarantee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, even if this Bill is passed, I

think  there is no value whatsoever. Can a poor  man  put

his  trust in this Bill when it is brought out by the ex-members  of the Labour Front? Now, they do not  represent

the  workers. How can the workers trust these  people  by

putting  their  good money into this  venture?  I  cannot

understand at all. They will have to wait till  the  next

government comes in and find out what the policy of  that

government is before they will consider taking a lead and

invest  in this project, but not when the present  people

are in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many industries. If you go through the

share market reports you will see that the shares offered

vary from 50 cents to any amount above that. You can  buy

them and make a profit. A small man can even buy $1 worth

of shares or $100 worth of shares. There are some returns

which  we  see  every day in the open list of  the  share

market reports. These investments are available and  more

profitable to them. Will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



they  venture to go into something which is an  unknown

quality and with no return?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made about cigarettes and matches. If the

idea is to invest the small people's money in this way,

the  small men, instead of reaping a harvest from their

investment,  will have to buy their own cigarettes  and

matches  at a higher price. In other words,  they  will

not  only  put in their own money, but they  will  also

have  to  pay  a higher price for the same thing  which

they  are  getting  in the open market  at  competitive

prices.  I  do  not think anyone has given  thought  to

this. A reply will be very interesting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to make it competitive as far as selling is

concerned, you will have to give them a preferential or

tariff  duty. The common men will be prevented or  will

not  be able to afford and enjoy the various brands  at

their  disposal. Of course, they will be  at  a  higher

price because of the present Government's taxation  and

duties.   Moreover,  the  people  will  be  handicapped

because  they are used to a particular thing  and  they

cannot  get  it.  They will then  say,  "Well,  I  have

invested  more than $10, but now I have to pay  another

$10 per month to buy my own cigarettes or matches.

It is  so very much more." It will be another burden to



them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, this Bill is nothing but a farce.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Sir, for $10, a working man can

make  an  investment  in  a very successful  industrial

concern,  at the present time. This scheme, I am  sure,

will  be measured by the number of subscribers who  are

willing  to  put money in it. I am not certain  whether

the  idea is that they put the money in first and  then

the investments are made afterwards, or the investments

are  going  to  be carefully worked out  and  then  the

members  of  the public will be asked to  subscribe  to

something  which might or might not be a  success.  But

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry has stated that

he has complete confidence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



in the success of cigarette making and match making. It

might  well  be  better if the Government  experimented

with any project first - if it is really successful, then

give  the  members of the public a chance to invest  in

something that is successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point which I would like the Hon. Minister

to  answer. Will this corporation be subject to  income

tax like all other trading corporations?



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

People's Investment Corporation Bill appears to  a  man

in  business  to  have some catch somewhere.  I  really

cannot understand how this thing can work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I refer to the explanatory statement.

It  says  that there will be a contingent liability  on



Government  funds in the case of total loss of  capital

up  to  the  amount of shares issued but  which  cannot

exceed  $10  million. This, of course,  refers  to  the

Government's guarantee to redeem at par if there  is  a

loss. But if it is a total loss, I can imagine that  it

will exceed $10 million because, according to the Bill,

there  is  a Board of Directors, to be appointed  which

will       necessarily      involve      administrative

expenses - Director's  fees  from  year  to   year.   The

eventual  loss,  if  it is a total loss  at  all,  must

exceed $10 million; that is, if the shares are taken up

to $10 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the posts of the

Directors - there  are six or seven to be  appointed -seem

to  me  to be sinecure, because the Directors are  only

there  to  be  recommended by the Industrial  Promotion

Board   what  to  invest.  They  themselves   have   no

discretion to manage or to invest in any ventures which

they  might  think fit. This $10 million is  after  all

public  money,  which, in the event  of  failure  of  a

venture will be lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that I have very grave doubts

whether  anybody will subscribe to the shares  of  this

corporation. First, it is limited to 50 shares  of  $10

each, which is $500. No doubt, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



intention  of  the  Hon.  Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry  is good and he probably has at the  back  of

his  mind the idea that these people are to be working

men and women. But there is no provision here that if,

for  instance,  Members of the  Assembly  were  to  be

interested  in  the shares and they are  not,  in  the

sense  as  implied  here,  ordinary  working  men  and

women - they would be debarred from buying these shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine the ordinary working men and women who have

saved  $500  to  invest. Surely with no  assurance  of

profit  they could be more well advised to  invest  in

City  Council loans which at the present market  value

yield  a  sure  return of about six per cent  a  year,

instead of venturing. It is not a venture, in the real

sense  of the word, but still it is in that they  will

have  to put away the $500 maybe for a period of  five

or  ten  years without any profit or any  dividend  at

all, although they may be assured that in the case  of

loss they can still get their $500 back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is one thing which is not very clear to

me.  That is, people who want to buy shares need  only

show  their  identity cards. Persons of 12  years  old

have  identity  cards,  and presumably  they  will  be

allowed  to  buy  shares. But when  a  transfer  comes

along, would they, being minors, be legally allowed to

transfer those shares?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that, as I see it, there must be a

catch somewhere. Otherwise, I do not see how this

thing could succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jumabhoy, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it is often said that a

little knowledge is dangerous. But today I discover

that no knowledge aired in public is more dangerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am curious. I can understand the motive of

the  hon.  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar.  He  is  really

frightened of this. He knows - [Laughter.] What is the

good  of laughing aloud? He knows that if this venture

were to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



be  brought about successfully - he will, of course, see

that it is not, I know that - then his voters will say,

"Yes,  the  P.A.P. is good; but look at  these  chaps - Jumabhoy,  Lim  Yew Hock and company. They  have  also

done  something good for the people." He is afraid  of

that. I know that, Sir. He was speaking so surely  and

so fervently that this venture would come to nought. I

wonder, Sir, what is going on behind the scenes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I made this statement on the 10th of

September  last,  I  had  been  negotiating  with  the

British American Tobacco Company, who control about 80

per  cent  of the cigarette trade here, to manufacture

here  on this basis: 49-49-2. The effect would be that

the   people  will  not  be  forced  to  smoke   other

cigarettes.  You  will get your Players,  Capstan  and

Double  Ace.  Only, instead of being made in  England,

they  will  be  made here, and instead of  the  B.A.T.

taking 100 per cent profit, they will only take 49 per



cent and the people of Singapore will get 49 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Sir, I am not so sure, with the Member for

Tanjong Pagar stating so surely that this will come to

nought.  Something is going on behind the  scenes  and

the P.A.P. is capable of doing its utmost to destroy a

political  opponent. That I know. But the people  will

know  that if this venture does not come about,  there

will  be  nothing  better for the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar,  and  probably  they will  then  be  suspicious

whether  or not somebody has done something  to  bring

this venture to nought in the interests of a political

party,  not caring for the interests of the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations are still going on with the B.A.T. but

these could not be finalised because this Bill is  not

law  yet.  That might have taken the wind out  of  the

sails  of the Member for Tanjong Pagar. But I  do  not

think   so,   Sir.  He  was  well  aware  that   these

negotiations were going on. In fact, he saw the people

concerned when they were here in September last.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



That  is why I am suspicious that something behind  the

scenes must be going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tiong Bahru has said that the

Government has been 3½ years in office and  has  done

nothing. Sir, everything is not done the first day  the

Government takes office. Things have got to  be  worked

out.  If  things are worked out and they  take  two  or

three  years,  we  are too late.  If  things  are  done

quickly, then they are thrown before the House  without

proper study. Either way it is the Government at fault.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> This is the

proper time to buy votes!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, if I reply to that, I will

have to give a lengthy newspaper quotation of what  has

happened-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not quite certain what that

remark was. If it is a point of order, I would like the

Minister  to  raise it as a point of  order;  otherwise

that remark must be struck off the record.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir, I do not want to raise

it as a point of order. I know the Member does not mean

anything  bad. "The Government is paying money  to  buy

votes" - he  means that this is-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Now

that  that  expression has been disclosed, I would  ask

the  hon.  Member who used that expression  to  confirm

that  he did mention those words. If the answer  is  in

the  affirmative, he must withdraw that expression. Mr

Goh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite agree

with  the Member for Tanjong Pagar, who just now  said

that  the  Government has been here for more than  3½

years-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon. Member please

inform the House whether he alleged the Government  was

buying votes?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you object, I

withdraw the expression.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the point was raised by the

Member  for  Tiong  Bahru and one  or  two  other  hon.

Members  as to why the Government does not guarantee  a

return of profits. Government has guaranteed the  money

on  the  original shares and so nobody  will  lose  his

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Profits!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The Government does not guarantee

profits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It will be noticed that even if

no  investment  is made in an industrial  venture,  the

directors   have  the  power  to  invest   in   trustee

securities and therefore some income would be  accruing

to  the  shareholders.  But  if  the  Government  gives

guaranteed returns, then it does not become a  business

venture,  but a gilt-edged security comparable  to  any

debentures  or  any Government or City  Council  loans.

That   is   not   the  intention  of  the   Government.

Government's intention is that the people of  Singapore

should  come into a business venture where they  cannot

get  a  guaranteed return, but because the shareholders

are  going to be the poor people, Government says, "You

shall  not  lose.  We shall guarantee you  against  any

loss." But that is as far as the Government can go. And

since  it  is going to be a business venture, you  take

your chance; instead of the Government guaranteeing you

five  or  six per cent, which is a meagre flea-bite  in

the  light of today's earning capacity, you can get  40

or 50 per cent if the Corporation makes a profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned about the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  being  so sure that it will come to nothing.  He

said  the  Industrial Promotion Board can  do  nothing.

That is not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Promotion Board has done some work. It

has lent out some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



money.  It is furnishing the Government with a  lot  of

industrial   technical  information  and  also   giving

assistance  to industries. But I am surprised  why  the

hon. Member is so sure that this will come to nothing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Judging from your past performance!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Judging from the Member's

cleverness, Sir, in fighting political battles, I  will

not  be  surprised if his prediction comes true because

of  something going on behind the scenes. The moment  I

discover that, I am going to expose it. In fact, I have

certain  information, but I do not consider it fair  to

disclose it now because I am not really satisfied  yet.

I  do  not  want to make use of the privilege  of  this

House   by  levelling  accusations  against  the   hon.

Member's Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said this move was to bolster the ego

of  the  Minister.  Because of  politics,  any  sincere

attempt   is   always  twisted.  Politicians   in   the

Opposition do not care whether a move is beneficial  to

the  people.  They  only care that the  move  shall  be

frustrated for their own political manoeuvring. That is

very bad and I am against that sort of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi raised sensible questions. I

did  not say it was not a socialist measure. I said  it

was  a  democratic socialist measure, not  a  socialist

measure  in  the normal sense that the Government  owns

the enterprise. Then he asked me when it is expected to

be  brought about. I think I covered that point at  the

beginning  when  I said, in answer to a  query  by  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar, that that depended  on  the

response   of  the  people  and  on  the   outcome   of

negotiations now going on with the B.A.T. and also with

other companies possibly. Then the hon. Member asked me

whether  the  import of cigarettes would be prohibited.

Sir, in my statement I have said that restrictions will

be placed on the import of cigarettes when this project

is  brought to fruition. Restrictions could be  in  the

form of either quantitative restrictions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



or by imposing a higher duty on imported cigarettes.  A

natural restriction would be brought about thereby.  We

do  not  contemplate a total prohibition in the initial

stages  at  least, but it remains to be  seen  how  the

venture goes and whether there is too much of smuggling

because  of higher duties on imported brands. Smuggling

could  increase the quantity of imported cigarettes  in

which case prohibition would probably have to come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member goes on to ask me about the

revenue  angle. The Member for Tanjong Pagar  was  sure

that  there  will be loss in revenue.  The  answers  to

questions  supplied by the Hon. the Financial Secretary

yesterday are pertinent. If you take one item, Player's

Medium, according to his answer given orally yesterday,

it  beats all other brands in the same grade. It  means

that  the release of Player's Medium is more than fifty

per  cent of Grade B cigarettes, which total 66,285,000

sticks a month. Sir, the release of Player's Medium  is

more  than 33 million sticks a month. Therefore, if  we

take  as  an example, we will see that the duty element

on  1,000 sticks is $19.44 and the retail price is $40.

That  means  that  the retail price  is  four  cents  a

cigarette. The duty element is 1.944 cents, which means

that  it  is  less  than  two cents  a  cigarette,  and

therefore  the cost of the actual cigarette  minus  the

duty  is  just a little over two cents to the consumer.

Now,  that duty element is on imported cigarettes.  The

present duty on tobacco for manufacture is very low.  I

think  it is $2.50 or something like that per  lb.  The

duty  element works out at half a cent for the  locally

manufactured cigarettes. Now it is very easy to put  an

excise  duty on local manufacture to the same level  of

$19.44 per 1,000 sticks and that is roughly two cents a

cigarette.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information. How many

local  manufacturers of cigarettes  are  there  at  the

moment  and  how  many  of them would  be  put  out  of

business as a result of this?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> There are three local

manufacturers. I do not contemplate that they  will  be

put  out of business because certain arrangements  will

be  made  with  them. I have said  so  in  my  previous

statement  too. If only the hon. Member would  care  to

look it up in the Hansard, it will be to his benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now supposing you take the two cents original cost of

a cigarette to the public without the duty element, the

local cigarette would then sell at two cents plus  half

a  cent  duty - 2½ cents. The imported cigarette  would

sell  at  two cents plus two cents - four cents.  If  you

keep it at the same price of four cents a cigarette  to

the  public  and, instead of import duty,  you  put  an

excise  duty raising it from half a cent to two  cents,

your  revenue is then guaranteed. You then  raise  your

duty  on  imported cigarettes from two  cents  to  four

cents  each  - this  is just a case  in  point - and  your

imported  cigarettes will cost the consumer  six  cents

each,  your locally-made cigarettes will cost him  four

cents each, as the imported cigarettes are costing  him

now,  and the duty element will be the same. Therefore,

there can be no loss of revenue. It is simple, Sir,  to

work it out, but hon. Members are not inclined to apply

their  minds  to it, because they are afraid  and  they

want to oppose it for political reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the Hon. the Financial Secretary's

reply  again,  and  it shows us  that  the  cost  of  a

cigarette retail, minus the duty element, to the public

is  two cents - the retail price of a cigarette is nearly

two  cents if you ignore the duty element. It is common

knowledge, Sir - you ask any retailer about this as it is

not  a  secret - that the retailer is getting  eight  per

cent  profit on his sales. When the retailer gets eight

per  cent, it is normal to expect the wholesaler to get

a  quarter  of  that - about two  per  cent.  Let  us  be

charitable and say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



that the wholesaler gets three per cent. That means  11

per  cent in all out of that two cents on four cents - 11

per  cent on the four cents is a safe basis - goes to the

wholesaler  and the retailer. Now, if you work  out  11

per  cent  of four cents, you get .44 cent on your  one

cigarette.  If you take that away from two  cents,  you

still  get about 1.6 cents, which is the price  charged

by  the  importing firm to the wholesaler. This is  all

worked  out.  I  am  not letting out  any  secrets  and

anybody  possessing  intelligence  can  work  it   out.

Therefore,  1.6  cent  is  the  price  charged  to  the

wholesaler by the importer. I have been to America  and

the  Philippines and I have studied the costing of  the

cigarette  industry thoroughly. You  can  buy  American

Virginia tobacco. We have got confirmed offers from the

United States of Virginia tobacco which is used in  all

the  English  cigarettes. These tobacco cigarettes  are

called  straight Virginias. You can buy it today  ready

cut  for  making into cigarettes with all the flavoring

and  so  on. The maximum price you pay is U.S.  $1  per

lb., that is M$3 per lb. For 1 lb. of tobacco, you  get

400  to  420  cigarettes. The tobacco  in  a  cigarette

therefore costs ¾ cent. But you never use all  Virginia

tobacco.  You use 30 or 40 per cent Rhodesian  tobacco,

because  Rhodesian  tobacco has a  better  colour;  the

Virginia tobacco has a more pungent odour and therefore

you  blend  it  with  Rhodesian tobacco.  The  cost  of

Rhodesian tobacco is half that of Virginia tobacco.  If

you  use  say,  40 per cent of Rhodesian tobacco,  then

your  cost  comes  down by 20 per cent  on  your  whole

cigarette and that will cover the paper, the labour and

so  on.  So, in effect, your cigarette should cost  you

well under one cent and therefore the profit factor  in

a  cigarette is more than ½ cent per stick. I  am  well

convinced  that it comes to ½ cent per  stick.  I  have

worked  it  all  out and the Manager of the  Industrial

Promotion  Board, who is an experienced man,  has  also

worked it out. I have checked it in Manila and have re-checked  it in America. The profit element is a  little

over  4  cent per stick on the medium grade cigarettes,

not on the very low grade cigarettes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  the answer to yesterday's Oral Question 2 (a)  is

that  one month's consumption is 152 million cigarettes

which works out to 5 million sticks a day. Five million

sticks  a day at half a cent profit on each stick  will

give you a profit element of $25,000 a day. If you work

it out further, it will give you $750,000 a month or $9

million  a  year. Am I a criminal, Sir, if I  want  the

people  of  Singapore to share half of this $9  million

profit  a year? I am labelled by the P.A.P. as one  who

thinks  of  imaginative schemes. Let the  people  know,

Sir,  who is right. If there are no machinations  going

on,  this scheme will come to fruition. If machinations

are  going  on, if threats are held out to the  foreign

investor that, "if the Government changes, we will  see

you if you come to agreement with this Government",  or

if  the  olive  branch is held out, "We will  give  you

better  terms  than the Lim Yew Hock  Government  gives

you",  then the people will know - and one day I am going

to publicise what terms we are offering in case another

Government tries to give better terms - which government

was  beneficial to the people or which Government  sold

them out. Anyhow, all that I am trying to do is to give

the people a half share-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I ask the Minister a question

on a point of clarification, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will not mind giving

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Afraid?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am not afraid, Sir, I have had

enough from the Member for Tanjong Pagar. Sir, if  only

the Member for Tanjong Pagar had less of the ego in him

and   gave  credit  to  others  also  for  having  some

brains - which he does not do - he would not have  made  me

reveal all these figures. He has shown his ignorance of

the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of information?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Yes, Sir. As regards the figures put

forward  by  the Minister for Commerce and Industry,  I

would  like  to know whether the quantity of cigarettes

smoked by the public will increase or reduce.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, that is a hypothetical

question. The quantity smoked is 5 million cigarettes a

day. If you give them the same brands made in Singapore

with  the  same formula and with the same Virginia  and

Rhodesian tobacco mixed, I do not see why there  should

be  a  switch to other brands. The switch can only come

if,  because of machinations, foreign firms  refuse  to

participate.  We will then be forced to  make  our  own

cigarettes. Even then, Sir, I have had the assurance of

dealers  of an adequate supply of tobacco. Believe  me,

Sir,   a   cigarette  is  not  a  difficult  thing   to

manufacture. In Thailand they are doing it,  and  their

quality  is  acclaimed to be as good  as  that  of  any

imported  cigarettes.  Though the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar may laugh, Sir, he knows in his heart that it  is

true,  that  it is not something that is  so  difficult

that  you  cannot make it here. You can make cigarettes

of an equivalent quality here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir, Now, I think that has

answered  the  question of Sir Ewen Fergusson  why  the

Government  should not start it first. My intention  is

that the public should participate in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing further to add to what I have said. I

think  I  have  clarified the position enough  and  the

public will not be under the impression that this is an

attempt at a political stunt, as put by somebody. It is

not,  Sir, It is a genuine attempt to give them a share

in  this  venture  with  millions  of  dollars'  profit

accruing to outsiders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.-[Mr J.M Jumabhoy]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.32 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a note of an alteration,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 5, to leave out "1958" and insert

"1959".



<br><br>That will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am going very slowly through this

Bill  because  I  do not think it will be  beyond  hon.

Members,  if they wish to, to make further comments  on

the clauses as are appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 4 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Sir, will the Corporation be

exempted from income tax or will it pay taxes like  any

other Corporation?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Corporation will pay tax

just   like  any  other  public  body,  but  the  joint

enterprise  or  the  cigarette  venture  or   whatever

venture it is, could apply for pioneer status under the

Pioneer Industry legislation, just as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



any other private company could. Government's intention

is,  before  any  floatation  is  made,  to  put  up  a

prospectus  to show them what the profits are  on  that

particular venture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 6 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If any hon. Member has any comments to

make on the Schedules, this is his opportunity to do

so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, since you have indicated that

this is an appropriate time to consider the Schedule, I

would  like to draw the House's attention to  clause  1

(1) of the Schedule:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall be permitted to hold more than fifty

shares  and  no  further share  shall  be  allotted  or

transferred  to  any  person who  already  holds  fifty

shares in the Corporation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not as good as the Hon. Minister for adding

and  subtracting but it seems to me that if each person

took  up  $500 worth of shares, there will not be  more

than  20,000 investors. In any case, according  to  the

Property Survey Report, there are no 20,000 people with

$500  to  invest. But - and this is just  by  way  of  an

opening  remark to preface my point - if,  in  fact,  the

Minister's intention is not to help the middle class to

become  richer, but to help the worker to become  petty

bourgeoisie, then surely he does not want to extend the

investment to the amount of 50 shares? He should  limit

it  to a figure much lower than that. Therefore I would

like  to ask him now to consider whether he would  like

to  reduce  the figure - if it is meant for the  workers,

and not for the middle class - to reduce it to 10 shares,

because  the average worker has not got $100 to invest.

That  is  the  first  point. I will  therefore,  at  an

appropriate time, Sir, move an amendment to reduce from

50 to 10.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister has not answered my

point-although  I see he was in consultation  with  his

legal  adviser.  There is no proviso  anywhere  in  the

Schedule to prevent the beneficial holding of more than

50  shares. And I think he knows the answer. He is such

a  bright  man that when it comes to a sticky question,

he  prefers  not to answer it: that is why he  did  not

want  me  to  ask  questions. The point  is:  there  is

nothing in the Schedule to prevent one man beneficially

holding $10 million worth of shares. The Schedule says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall be permitted to hold more than fifty

shares  and  no  further share  shall  be  allotted  or

transferred  to  any  person who  already  holds  fifty

shares in the Corporation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No share shall be allotted to any person unless such

person  has given in his application for the share  the

number  of  the identity card issued or  deemed  to  be

issued  to him under the provisions of the Registration

of  Persons Ordinance, 1955; and such number  shall  be

shown  in  the  Register of Shares  and  on  the  share

certificate issued to the person."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (3) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to the provisions of this section, all shares

shall be transferable."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Directors shall have power from time to time to

regulate the floating and issue of shares-"



<br><br>and  so  on.  Nothing prevents any man from  being  the

nominal  holder of a share and holding it in trust  for

somebody  else.  There is nothing in this  Schedule  to

prevent a wealthy man from getting other people to  buy

all the shares for him and getting everyone of them  to

sign  a  declaration of trust that he  is  the  nominal

holder  of  shares  for someone else.  This  is  common

practice - "I  (so  and so), who appear  as  the  nominal

holder of shares Nos. (so and so), hereby declare  that

I  hold them in trust for (so and so)." In my view, all

this is just so much sound and fury, and it is going to

come  to  nothing. But since we have to be logical  and

pursue  things  to  their logical conclusion-first,  we

should  reduce the figure to 10 shares if  we  want  to

help the workers and not the middle class; secondly, we

make  it  an offence for anyone to hold more than  that

either  as  nominee  or  as beneficial  owner.  Another

proviso, a completely new proviso, will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



have  to be worked out to make it an offence for anyone

to hold it on trust for another beneficiary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is, of course, out of

time  if he is thinking of moving an amendment, because

under  Standing  Order 51, paragraph 2,  "no  amendment

shall  be  proposed", that is to a  Bill,  "unless  two

clear  days'  notice thereof has been given."  But,  of

course,  the  hon. Member may seek the  assent  of  the

Assembly under the provisions of Standing Order 23.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I will move an amendment under

the Standing Order you have indicated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> At the appropriate time.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, if one cannot stymie the

Government  in  carrying out something which  is  good,

then one puts obstacles in the way. The hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar,  who has a very good knowledge  of  the

law, proposes to put obstacles. First, he mentioned the

middle class bourgeois (and other political terms which

the hon. Member is good at using). Sir, my intention is

contained  in  my  original statement  which  the  hon.

Member  does not care to read-these shares are intended

for the ordinary man and woman in Singapore. The middle-class  man,  that is the clerk, is also a working  man.

And  any  government does not necessarily look  to  the

interests of the labouring class only but also  to  the

interests  of  all the citizens, and the working  class

man,  according to my definition, is also the clerk  as

well as the labourer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attempt, Sir, to gain further time to try

to  stymie  the  Bill. At the worst, he now  tells  the

public that this is a capitalist government because  it

offers  50  shares and not 10 shares. He has failed  in

his   attempt  to  convince  his  left-wing  supporters

through  the Press that this is a bad move,  because  I

have given all the points, the profit angle, and so on,

and  it will be very difficult for him to challenge me.

Sir,  I  am not inclined to fall into the trap that  50

shares will create capitalism in the middle class.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



I am also not inclined to give my assent to his move to

reduce  the number of shares from 50 to 10. If he  were

genuine about it, he should have given notice; the Bill

after it was introduced has been with him for nearly  a

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point he raised - and he is a clever

lawyer - about a person holding shares in trust  has  got

me  confounded a bit. Sir, a simple mind like mine does

not  work out the intricate ways of overcoming the law,

but  a  clever  mind,  like that of  a  lawyer  of  his

calibre,  would be capable of working that  out.  I  am

glad,  Sir, he has pointed that out to me.  And  if  we

find  later on that this restrictive clause is  abused,

then  certainly an amendment will be moved at that time

to   remedy  that.  But  one  cannot  foresee  all  the

loopholes  that could arise as a result of a  new  law,

because  if  one  did then the lawyers  would  have  no

income  left.  One would have plugged the loopholes  at

the outset, and there would be no lawyers, and the hon.

Member would probably not be able to sit here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is the business of the

Legislative-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member will have

another opportunity to speak. We are in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, first of all, I would like to

point  out to the Hon. Minister that if it is true,  as

he  has  admitted that he has a simple  mind,  then  we

should  ask  him to confine it to simple subjects.  But

when  he  has  embarked  on the  intricate  and  highly

complex business of floating something which is neither

a  co-operative  nor  a  nationalised  industry  nor  a

mutualised  industry, something that does not  fall  in

all the known categories of political thinking anywhere

in  this  world,  when indeed he embarks  on  a  highly

complex  and intriguing situation, we expect a  complex

mind  to  bring itself to bear on the problem with  the

thoroughness and expertise which have been  lacking  in

this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use his telling us that we will wait and see

whether people abuse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



the lacuna that he has allowed within the Schedule. How

and  when is he going to find this out? Let me tell him

this:  we  do not want to waste time to try  and  block

this  Bill. We know the Bill will be passed  today.  We

have  not  the slightest intention of blocking  it.  We

know it will come to nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further we will tell him this: unless he makes an

amendment now - and he might obtain your permission, Sir,

to  get to work with his legal adviser for ten minutes.

If  he  likes, I am prepared to give him my  assistance

free,  to  work out a clause to make it impossible  for

people  to  buy  up shares in the name of  the  nominal

holders.  All this talk about nobody holding more  than

fifty  shares:  we will look after the clerk;  we  will

look  after the trisha riders; we will look  after  the

taxi   drivers;  we  will  even  look  after  the  poor

millionaires - all that it is going to do, if  it  is  in

fact  the  way he envisages it in his dream - the  B.A.T.

working  hard to produce profits for him, and he  says,

"Ah, you people of Singapore, I have got the B.A.T. to

work  for  you; 49 per cent - here you are." If it  works

out the way he dreams it, then we are all going to fall

into the hands of a few racketeers who will corner  the

share  market. That is all. And when he later moves  an

amendment,  there  will  be  a  hue  and  cry   against

retrospective legislation. And one of the  things  that

he  will  not  be able to do without being  accused  of

being  undemocratic  is  to  legislate  retrospectively

penal legislation of this nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let him consult his legal adviser. We are not in

the  least bit concerned whether this Bill goes through

or  not, but his legal adviser will tell him that it is

wrong    to   legislate   retrospectively   on    penal

legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

mind  is sometimes simple, sometimes brilliant, but  in

whatever  state my mind may be, Sir, I cannot visualize

any  one single millionaire in Singapore who will trust

1,000  individuals,  unknown to  him,  with  50  shares

registered  in  each  of  their  names.  If  one   such

individual does not cheat him, others will. We may have

some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



millionaires  in  this  Assembly.  Will  a  millionaire

trust  1,000 individuals unknown to him, with 50 shares

registered  in  each of their names in trust  for  him?

So,  Sir,  although an amendment may be  necessary  for

the  purpose of preventing one or two individuals  from

abusing  the  intention of this  Bill,  the  danger  of

having  a  millionaire investing hundreds of  thousands

of  dollars in the name of 50, 100 or 1,000 individuals

in trust for him, will never happen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I feel almost abashed at the

idea of a trade union lawyer trying to give advice to a

rich  man's  lawyer. If accompanying  the  document  of

trust  you also hold the shares and make sure you  send

your  representative to collect the  dividends  on  the

basis  of  the shares, surely a rich man's lawyer  like

the  hon.  Member  Mr  R. C. H. Lim  could  well  work

out - and  I  am sure he must in his long and  successful

career at the Bar have worked out - one thousand and  one

guarantees  to  make sure that the  money  having  been

transferred  and all the formalities having  been  gone

through,  there is a sufficient grasp on the  documents

to  prevent any swindling. I do not want to be  accused

of  having  joined  the  fierce people  who  constantly

terrify the Minister for Commerce and Industry and make

him  go into sudden and unexpected retreat. But I would

ask  him, with your consent, Sir, to adjourn this House

for  ten  minutes and work out a new clause so that  it

becomes penal before it comes into operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent some time in New Delhi recently discussing

the   rule  of  law.  The  Attorney-General   will   be

interested   to  know  this,  one  of  the  fundamental

principles which was upheld was that there should be no

penal legislation which is retrospective. You can  have

retrospective civil legislation. You can try and  right

something  which  was done wrong;  but  if  a  man  has

already  acquired a beneficial interest in  100,000  of

those   shares   and  you  then   make   it   a   crime

retrospectively, it is contrary to the rule of law. So,

I  would  suggest a ten-minute adjournment to help  the

Minister for Commerce and Industry out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is one of

the greatest social legislative measures ever passed in

this  House, a measure which is going to give  members

of  the  lower income group a chance to be shareholders

of  a  company,  and perhaps directors  of  a  company.

Imagine  the  pride of an ordinary clerk, a  hawker,  a

trishaw rider holding shares and being a director of  a

company!  Never has it happened before.  Government  is

offering  that  opportunity. Sir, an amendment  may  be

necessary  to  make sure that any trust  would  not  be

recognised. There may be no need for any penalty to  be

affixed,  but the Government should refuse to recognise

any  trust. And any limited company has always provided

that no trust will be recognised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I do not want to start a legal

debate  with  a gentleman who is expert in  stabilising

the worries of other people, but -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think perhaps we should avoid

personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, Sir, I was just trying to

say,  with humility, how reluctant I am to embark on  a

legal  dissertation in this House. But to  pass  a  law

subsequent  to  this  and say  that  all  trusts  shall

henceforth  be ignored, implies forfeiture of  a  man's

beneficial interest, and that is penal legislation.  It

is  as  simple  as that. If you say to a  man  who  has

acquired  a  beneficial interest in property  that  his

beneficial  interest  will not be recognised,  that  is

penal, because you are confiscating his property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr R. C. H. Lim's point that all companies do

not recognise trusts, that is true, for the purposes of

their  company's  books. They do not care  whether  A's

share is held in trust for

B  or  C or D. They pay A or whoever has got the  share

scrip,  and that is the end of the company's liability.

But  B,  who  is the beneficial owner can  enforce  his



beneficial interest against A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as simple as this. If I hold 50 shares, and one

quiet  day  I  am inveigled to sell them  to  the  Hon.

Minister  for  Commerce  and Industry,  and  I  sign  a



document to say that I hold them in trust for him,  and

then I go and collect the money, as far as the People's

Investment  Corporation are concerned, they  have  paid

the  shareholder.  They are not interested.  But  if  I

refuse  to  pay  the  Hon. Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry  what I have acquired for him, because  he  is

the beneficial owner, an action lies against me to hand

over  the proceeds. If the Attorney-General comes along

and  says that all that shall be illegal, that is penal

legislation made retrospective because, at the time the

poor Minister acquired the beneficial interest, it  was

not illegal to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am rather lost in this. To

my  way  of thinking, if a man goes and gets a thousand

persons to become shareholders and agree to write  that

they  have  given  him  their shares  as  trustee,  the

dividend that the company pays out will still  only  be

paid to the registered holders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> To whoever holds the share scrip.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No. It is the normal company

practice that, on a certain date before paying out  the

dividend,  the transfer books are closed and  then  the

dividend  warrants are made out in  the  names  of  the

registered shareholders. Now, if a person has gone  and

bought  shares from 1,000 persons be cannot  claim  the

dividend.  The dividend will be paid to the  registered

shareholders, and these shareholders may refuse to give

him  the dividend, because he cannot then legally  say,

"I own these shares", since a person is prohibited from

owning  more than 50 shares. So that dividend  will  be

paid  only to the registered shareholders, who can then

refuse  to pay him. I do not think a man would then  go

and  sue  these  one thousand persons  for  such  small

amounts like $200 or $300 each, that being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



the dividend. That is my interpretation. However, as  I

said,  I will look into this question. I marvel at  the

ability  of  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  to  make  a

mountain out of a mole hill!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is the way he has described this new

scheme.  He says the scheme does not fall into  any  of

the political thoughts-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Categories.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes. I am sorry. I did not catch

the word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It does not fall into any category

of socialist enterprise.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That shows the narrow confines

within which his political theories work. He cannot get

away from the narrow confines of Marxism, "Thisism"  or

Thatism"!  He cannot imagine new ideas or  new  schemes

but he must perforce confine himself only to those that

are thought out by others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know, Sir, whether an amendment is

necessary,  but  I  shall  certainly  look   into   the

question.  If an amendment is necessary, I  shall  then

bring up an amending Bill to incorporate the amendment.

At  this  stage,  Sir, I do not think an  amendment  is

necessary, because I think the fears expressed  by  the

Member  are  just too imaginary. Possibly he  has  been

able,  by  his command of English and his knowledge  of

law,  to  try  to exaggerate those fears, so  that  the

public reading the newspapers will open themselves to a

future  suggestion, "Ah, this is the way  a  capitalist

government  try  to  make  the  capitalists  own   this

company."



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> I want to make a point of

clarification on the shares. It has been stated that  a

dividend  cannot  be  paid  to  anybody  else  but  the

registered  shareholder. But as  I  understand  it  any

registered shareholder can give directions, "Please  do

this."  I  also do not see anywhere where  it  says  no

person can mortgage his shares. Surely there is nothing

to  stop him from borrowing money on the shares  if  he

wants to.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, I wish to draw the attention of

the  Minister for Commerce and Industry to the Schedule

at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>



page 3, clause 3 on the redemption of shares. It states

there:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shares of the Corporation shall be redeemable at

par  at the office of the Corporation or at such  other

piece or places as may be decided by the Corporation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that where shares are presented for

redemption payment for such shares may be made  by  the

Corporation  within  three  months  of  the   date   of

presentation."



<br><br>As  we  know,  these shares will be sold to  the  lower

income  group,  as Mr R. C. H. Lim has  just  said - the

taxi-drivers,  bus  conductors and other  working-class

people.  What I want to know is why must it take  three

months  from  the  date  of  presentation  before   the

investor  can redeem his shares? A person in the  lower

income  group may save a few hundred dollars  and  then

buy  shares from the Corporation; later he may suddenly

find  himself in urgent need of money. In  such  cases,

provision  should be made for this type  of  people  to

redeem  their  shares and get the money back.  We  must

provide  them with the facility to withdraw  or  redeem

their  money immediately without their having  to  wait

for three months.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The three-month clause is an

enabling clause. It says a maximum of three months.  It

means  that  there  is  nothing to  prevent  the  early

repayment  of  the  money  in  the  case  of  a  person

redeeming his shares. But supposing there is a  run  on

the  Corporation, and all the money of the  Corporation

is  invested,  then this three-month clause  will  come

into  use, because that will give the Corporation  time

to  get assistance from the Government to redeem  these

shares,  since  the  Government is  guaranteeing  these

shares  and will have to pay up. Before Government  can

pay up this money, we have to get the Treasury to raise

the  funds and so on. Therefore, the three-month period

will  come  in  useful.  But  normally  in  simple  and

straight-forward cases, a man seeking  redemption  will

get his money at once.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true to say

that a company, on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>



proper  authority from the shareholder,  must  pay  the

dividend   to   the   person  so  authorised   by   the

shareholder. But, Sir, in actual practice,  as  I  have

said  before, can anyone imagine a millionaire  of  any

type  asking  for an authority from a hawker  that  the

dividend from his 50 shares be paid to him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why not? The Government-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member will have an

opportunity to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> However much we may dislike a person

who has accumulated his wealth, we cannot underestimate

his  intelligence. Will a millionaire buy shares in the

name of 1,000 nominees? Is it worth his while to go  to

the  trouble  of  getting 1,000  persons  and  to  give

written  authority  to  his  nominees  to  collect  the

dividends  on the shares? In actual practice this  will

never happen. In fact, from the very beginning, I  have

suggested a little amendment - "no holding on trust". But

I  have  been convinced by the Minister that in  actual

practice this will not happen, and I think he is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I inquire from the Minister

whether  he  is  against  a man  mortgaging  shares  or

putting them on pledge and so on? All these intricacies

must surely have been given their due consideration  by

his adroit mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sometimes a man

is  in  need  of money. As these will be  poor  people,

therefore, if a man is in need of money quickly, he can

either  come for redemption and get his money  quickly,

or,  if  there is a delay in redemption,  then  he  can

mortgage his shares and raise the money temporarily.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr R. C. H. Lim

has said that ordinarily nobody would be interested  in

investing money in 1,000 people holding 50 shares each.

But  the eventual danger really is when the Corporation

succeeds and makes money like 100 per cent or  200  per

cent  profit.  Then if the shareholder  is  allowed  to

mortgage  his  shares, he could be  induced  to  borrow

money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>



from  somebody with the shares as guarantee. There  are

ways  whereby people will get interest. If a $500 share

were   to  go  up  to,  say,  $2,000,  you  will   find

businessmen  interested  in  offering  the  shareholder

something like $1,000 as a loan - knowing that  he  is  a

registered owner of the shares - and then extracting, not

the dividend itself, but the equivalent of the dividend

as interest. There is the danger. If the Corporation is

very successful, then the danger will arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do not consider that a

danger. That is one time when the poor working man  has

his own back on the capitalist, and sells him something

at a greatly enhanced price. Usually it is the reverse.

Therefore,  I will be very happy if a working  man  who

owns a $10 share can sell it for $1,000.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

the  Hon. Minister to clarify the Schedule. "The shares

of the Corporation shall be redeemable al par". Is this

Corporation a revolving Corporation? Is there any power

to  re-issue  shares after they have been  redeemed?  Is

there such a thing as a re-issue?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also one other point. I wonder whether the

Minister has thought of, Sir. The Corporation has many,

many  small shareholders. They are restricted  to  $500

each.  Dividends are paid subject to the  reduction  of

tax,  like every other corporation. So if you pay  five

per  cent  in  one year on $500-$25 less  40  per  cent

brings   it   down   to   $15.   Everyone   of    these

shareholders - let us say there are 20,000 - makes a  claim

or  fills up an income tax form and claims a return  of

their  income tax. I do not say it is a bad thing,  but

is it one of those things that should have been thought

out when the Schedule was drawn up?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if it were the

intention  that the shareholders should make  five  per

cent profit, this Corporation would not have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>



been  floated. I gave the figure of $9 million  on  the

cigarette industry as the possible profit accruing.  If

the  factory requires $5 million capital,  half  of  it

will  come  to $2½ million. If the profit factor  were

only  $2  million  or  $3 million  on  the  $5  million

capital, the percentage would probably come to 50 or 60

per cent profit. Therefore, the Singapore man would get

between  $200 and $300 on his $500 investment. That  is

my  own working out of the possibilities, but the  real

possibilities  will be worked out  in  the  form  of  a

prospectus.  The  answer to the other question  raised,

Sir, is in the affirmative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, since the Minister has already

indicated his intention not to give heed to my

application for leave to change the figure "50" to

"10", or rather, despite his intention not to agree, I

shall still ask you, Sir, to ask the House for their

assent to change "50" to "10".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reason in so moving is quite simply this. There is

no difficulty in any one person owning anywhere between

five  and ten times the figure actually set down  here.

The  average family - mother, father, five children, plus

grandfather and grandmother - comes to nine. Nine  times

50 shares will bring it up to 450 shares-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have allowed the Member to

carry  on  up to now, but I think he ought to  ask  for

leave first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker, Sir. I

ask for the assent of the House to move an amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the word "fifty" in clause 1 (1) of the Schedule

be struck off and the word "ten" be inserted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Hon. Members, of course, are aware that

notice  of  an amendment of that nature ought  to  have

been  given, but the hon. Member is asking  for  assent

under the provisions of Standing Order 23, which reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notice shall not be dispensed with in the case of a

motion or in respect of any other proceeding for  which

notice  is  required  except with the  consent  of  the

Speaker and the general assent of Members present."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give my consent. Is it the pleasure of hon. Members

that the motion be moved?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock):</b> May I crave

your indulgence, Sir? You have given the hon. mover  of

that motion a chance to speak. I would like to be given

a  chance  to explain why we cannot agree to  give  our

assent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the hon. Member went as

far  as  that.  I think the hon. Member  spoke  on  the

merits of his amendment, and that is all. If any Member

on  the  Government  Bench wishes to  comment  on  that

aspect, then assent should be given. The question  will

then  be  before the Assembly and then a  debate  could

take place. But if no assent is given, then, of course,

that is the end of the matter. I repeat my question. Is

it  the pleasure of hon. Members that assent should  be

given? Is it "Aye" or "No"? That is all I want.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> May I rise on a point of

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Will you be calling each item on

the  Schedule?  Will we again have the  opportunity  to

speak on the Schedule?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In which case the clarification

the Chief Minister now seeks could be given later.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> But not, of course, as to the reasons

why assent is not being given.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of clarification. Is

this  assent  to be given in regard to this  number  of

shares?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Assent to the request by the hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar that he be given leave to move

an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>



amendment  of  which he has not given notice.  And  the

amendment  he has suggested is in page 2, line  33,  to

leave out "fifty" and there to insert "ten". All I need

now  is an "Aye" or a "No". Is it the pleasure of  hon.

Members that absent be given?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Aye.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am obliged that, as a result

of confusion amongst the S.P.A. Ministers,-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is getting rather late and I

do   not   think  we  should  indulge   in   any   more

personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, Sir, I was anonymous in my

reference.  Nevertheless, the point that I  was  making

was  that  in Singapore, where the size of  an  average

family is anywhere between five and ten - father, mother,

three   to  five  children,  grandfather,  grandmother,

uncles  and aunts - there is no difficulty for any single

person  to own anything between five and ten times  the

statutory  maximum number of shares. I  have  indicated

earlier - and  the  Minister for  Commerce  and  Industry

agreed  with me - that it is extremely unlikely that  the

average  worker will have even $100 to invest and  that

the  limit  of $500 is the average investment potential

of  the  middle class. Therefore, if we allow 50 shares

to  be  the  maximum, then in fact we are allowing  the

average man with a family of five to ten people to  own

500  shares. Apart from the question whether Mr R.  C.

H.  Lim thinks that it is a risk or it is not a risk to

hold  just a beneficial interest in shares - there is  no

risk  whatsoever in any person holding them in his name

or  in  the  names of his wife, his five children,  his

aged  father and his mother. He collects the  dividends

and  it is his investment. Then, far from it just being

a  $500 investment, it becomes a $5,000 investment;  or

if  the  size of the family is sufficiently  large,  or

there  are sufficient numbers of faithful retainers  in

the family, it may well be 50 or 60 times the statutory

maximum number of shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask the House to join me in my amendment

that "fifty" be changed to "ten".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Second

Reading of this Bill, it was pointed out by the hon.

mover of this amendment that the scheme would not be

successful and that nothing would come out of it. In

order to ensure that it will not be successful and that

nothing will come out of it, he is doing all he can

during the Committee stage to try and confuse the

public of Singapore with regards to the intentions of

the Government and the usefulness of the scheme which

the Minister has embodied in his Bill. While it is true

that no labouring class man would be in a position to

own 50 shares all at once, it does not mean that he

should be deprived of the opportunity to increase his

holdings up to a maximum of 50 shares in due course of

time. Again I say that this is another attempt on the

part of the Opposition, particularly the P.A.P., to try

to make it impossible for this scheme to go forward. If

we reduced it to ten shares only, Sir, it would

increase the work of the Corporation in seeking the $10

million required. If it is up to a maximum of fifty

shares, the time factor and the number of people who

would like to participate in the scheme would be

considerably reduced. The Member said he did not think

that it was a good scheme and it was a matter of

opinion. Therefore, he would like to make it more

difficult by limiting the number of shares for each

person to ten shares!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose the amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do I understand

from the Hon. the Chief Minister's reply that, in fact,

he  agrees with me that the average investment possible

is  five to ten times fifty shares? He has not given an

answer  to that. All that he is able to put forward  in

justification  of  keeping it  at  50  shares  is  that

perhaps a poor man can only buy one $10 share and  that

in  the  course  of  time,  when  he  accumulates  more

capital,  he  can buy fifty shares. That  is  the  most

specious  argument ever put forward in this  House.  If

the  Corporation is a success, all the shares  will  be

snapped  up.  If  it is a flop, the poor  man  will  be

wanting   back   his  $10  which  the  Government   had

guaranteed at par. Never mind about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>



motives  and  intentions! Let us  meet  arguments  with

arguments! My argument is that if you say 50 shares  is

the  maximum,  in  effect,  in  the  Asian  society  in

Singapore, an average family man will be able  to  hold

500  shares.  Every lawyer knows that  no  wealthy  man

holds properties in his name. He has properties in  the

names  of all his various wives, girl friends,  uncles,

grand  aunts,  nephews  and a  whole  retinue  of  camp

followers. With this practice of five to ten members of

an  average man's family holding shares, the investment

becomes  anywhere  from $5,000  to  $15,000.  In  other

words, far from weeping at the thought of the poor  man

who,  for the first time in his life is given a  chance

to become a Director in case he gets elected by all his

other  poor  fellowmen, it will be the  usual  ring  of

shareholders  and  share investors who  will  take  the

profit out of the Singapore Investment Corporation.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether I am making a mistake but just now I heard  the

Member   for  Tanjong  Pagar  say  that  he  was   only

interested in facing an argument with an argument,  and

that the debate was not on motives and intentions. Sir,

I  think  that  is  quite wrong.  We  are  debating  an

important  Bill. If the Member for Tanjong Pagar  takes

such  an  attitude towards this debate,  he  is  merely

wasting  our  time, Sir, I want to ask the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar this. What is the reason for his  moving

such  an amendment? Why is it wrong for a family of  5,

10  or even 20 persons buying 50 shares each? It is not

a matter of facing an argument with an argument, but it

is  one of principle. What is the intention of the hon.

Member by bringing up this amendment? What is wrong for

a  big family wanting to buy 250 shares under different

names?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> What is wrong is that the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar did not first think of the idea, and

he  does  not want to acknowledge that this is  a  good

move. I marvel, Sir, at him. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



I  ever need a lawyer, I promise that I will go and see

him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have stopped the Member for

Tanjong Pagar from indulging in personalities, and  the

Minister is now embarking on personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir, It was not meant

in  any bad sense. At first, he tried to build it  into

something  that  is  useless and  which  will  come  to

nought. Now he tries to twist the angle, that he is the

champion  of the people fighting for the poor  labourer

against the imaginary bourgeois - the middle-class!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is the $500 necessary? The $500 is the

maximum enabling figure. It need not necessarily follow

that every one must be given shares up to the value  of

$500.  In  normal  company practice,  when  shares  are

floated,  if the shares applied for are more  than  the

number of shares to be floated, they are then allocated

in proportion to the number of shares applied for. Sir,

if  the  first  floatation was for $2½ million  or  $3

million as a start for a cigarette factory venture, and

instead,   of  20,000  applicants  there  are   100,000

applicants, then those applying for 50 shares each will

get  ten  shares  each. It is up to the Corporation  to

allocate the shares. No person can say, "I have applied

for 50 shares and therefore I must get 50 shares."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Hon. the Chief Minister, the hon.

Member  said that if the Corporation was a success  all

the shares would be snapped up. That is not so. All the

shares of each floatation will be snapped up. It is not

intended to float all the $10 million at the same time,

if the venture is a success, the Directors can call for

its  extension and this will mean finding  more  money.

Then that is the time when new people can come into the

venture,  because all shares will rank pari  passu - that

is stated in the Schedule. The Directors could then say

that  the  existing  shareholders should  not  get  the

shares and that new applicants should get the new issue

of  shares. They could very well say that. It is up  to

the Minister, Sir, to direct if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>



he  wishes  to  do  so,  because there  will  be  three

appointed  Directors and the Chairman will be appointed

by the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Sir, is the Minister accepting

responsibility for issuing the shares when he says that

the  Directors  may not issue what a particular  person

applies  for,  and  may  not even  issue  them  to  one

particular person?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not a

question  of  the  Minister being responsible  for  the

issue  of shares. The Minister can give a directive  on

all  the  things  that come within his  portfolio.  For

instance,  I can give a general directive - I  think  the

Governor  in  Council  can - to the Industrial  Promotion

Board, and so on. In fact, this is not a matter where a

Minister  will say, "I exercise this by my  authority."

It  is  a  matter of general directive for  the  public

good. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, let me wind up the argument on

principle.  We  are not just arguing for  the  sake  of

argument.  The  argument is based on the  principle  of

this   Bill.  This  Bill  will  come  to  nought.   The

Government is insisting on going through with it. I  am

now  holding  the  Government to the principle  it  has

enunciated  as  the  raison d'etre of  this  Bill.  The

raison  d'etre,  I  understood from  the  Minister  for

Commerce  and Industry, is not to help the share-owning

class  to  own  more shares in a guaranteed  profitable

concern,  but  to  help  the  usually  non-share-owning

class - the poor workers - who have not got $500 to invest

anyway, to get them firstly, to save money;

secondly,  to  invest  the  money  on  industry;   and,

thirdly, to provide them with good profits. I am saying

that  if  you want to achieve that, then that principle

is  not being achieved when you limit the maximum to 50

times $10, which is $500

per  person.  As  I have explained - and nobody  had  the

audacity  to  refute  it - there  is  no  difficulty  in

Singapore  to  multiply that by five  to  ten.  If  the

Government  sincerely believes that the purpose  is  to

help  the  non-share-owning public to own shares,  then

the maximum ownership of the number of shares should be

reduced. If, in fact, that is not the scheme but it is,

in the words of the Minister for Commerce and Industry,

"only a political stunt", then so be it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard the

hon.  Member say that no one had the audacity to refute

the  reason for his amendment. It would mean, Sir, that

if  any  one had the courage to stand up to refute  any

reason  of  his,  it is audacity. What cheek  and  what

impertinence!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It pains me to have to pull up

the  Chief Minister on a point of order of that nature.

I am sure that he did know, before he used those words,



that they are completely unparliamentary and I ask  him

to withdraw those words.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I beg to withdraw both those

words.  Well, it may be better to leave things  unsaid!

One  can  see  how I feel. If anyone says  anything  to

refute the reasons put forward by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>



the  hon.  Member,  it  is  audacity.  Sir,  I  am  not

audacious at all. I have never been and I hope  I  will

never  be. But I say that the Government is introducing

this measure in order to bring in the working class  to

participate  in  a  cigarette factory.  That  has  been

mentioned.  The  Opposition, particularly  the  P.A.P.,

says  that  it  cannot  be done. All  right,  they  are

entitled to their view. We say that it can be done  and

we  are doing all we can to prove that we are right. We

do  not  feel that we need any assistance from them  to

try to carry out what we think is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 22, to leave out "nominated" and

insert "appointed".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a drafting amendment to bring it in line with

the language used in other parts of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.
