<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>HIGHER MALAY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assessment of performance of Malay language students)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Education whether his

Ministry's  assessment  of  the performance  of  Malay  language

students  in  schools will allow more students  to  take  Higher

Malay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Ministry has relaxed the criteria for allowing  pupils

to  take  Higher Mother Tongue.  From year 2000, EM2 pupils  who

have  scored  a  Band 1 in their mother tongue language,  (Malay

Language (ML), Chinese Language (CL) or Tamil Language (TL)) and

at  least a Band 2 in English Language and Mathematics,  at  the

Primary  4  Streaming examination, will be given the opportunity

to offer a Higher Mother Tongue Language at Primary 5.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, pupils who are in the top 10% of the PSLE cohort are

allowed  to  offer  Higher Mother Tongue  (ML,  CL  and  TL)  at

Secondary One.  In addition, those who are in the top 11% to 20%

of  the  cohort  and who have scored an A* in the mother  tongue

language and an A in English Language are also allowed to  offer

Higher  Mother  Tongue at Secondary One.  This  applies  to  the

Malay  Language, Chinese Language and Tamil Language.  In total,

about  350  pupils in Secondary 1 are eligible to  offer  Higher

Malay Language in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now broadened this to include pupils in the top 21% to

30% of the cohort, subject to the same language requirements  as

for  pupils  in the top 11% to 20% group.  This will  allow  150

more Secondary 1 pupils to offer Higher Malay in our schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

would like to ask the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>

Minister, compared to other subjects, for example,

Mathematics, Science and English, are Malay students facing

problems in learning the Malay language?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> The Malay students in our schools have

done  progressively better over the years.  But there  is  still

room  for improvement.  Our Malay students can get more  out  of

our  education  system than they are getting today.   But  their

performance in the Malay language is not the factor that hampers

their progression through our education system.  In fact, it  is

the  other  subjects,  English,  Mathematics  and  Science,  for

example,  which hamper their progression through  our  education

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Can I ask the Minister whether,

that being the case, a CL `B' equivalent in this case may not be

necessary  for  Malay  students and, secondly,  if  Mathematics,

Science  and  English are some of the weaker subjects  faced  by

Malay  students, would the Minister consider introducing special

programmes  and syllabus to enable Malay students to  cope  with

these subjects?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Whether or not ML `B' is required is a

matter  of continuing discussion which we are having.   We  have

made  no  decision on that yet.  Whether or not we want to  have

special  programmes for Mathematics and Science  and  a  special

syllabus, perhaps a Mathematics `B' or Science `B'?  We  already

have  at  the secondary school level Mathematics and Science  at

various levels.  For example, we have Additional Mathematics and

Mathematics  D.   We have the pure sciences, Physics,  Chemistry

and  Biology,  and we have the combined sciences,  Physics  with

Chemistry,  Physics with Biology, etc.  So students can  take  a

combination  of subjects which suits their aptitudes  and  which

they  think  they  can  do  well in  and  which  would  be  most

appropriate considering what further education they want  to  go

on to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mathematics and Science, it would not be beneficial to

have  a  separate syllabus, particularly if it is  tailored  for

Malay  students,  because  it would not  serve  the  purpose  of

providing a solid

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>

foundation that is necessary for progression,

particularly in technical and science courses, in further

education.  But, say, in English, for example, for the EM1 and

EM2 students,  although we do not have a different standard, we

do have a programme which is beginning to show quite good

success at the lower primary level, Primary 1 and Primary 2, and

it is called the learning support programme.  This programme

provides support through learning support coordinators to

children who have difficulties in English and it provides them

additional teaching and coaching in English so that they

increase their reading age in English and that will help them in

all their other subjects.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, would the Ministry

consider identifying more schools to offer Higher Malay now that

the  eligibility has been extended to pupils in the top  21%-30%

cohort?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, there are now currently 10

schools  which  are  offering Higher  Malay  and  four  of  them

function  as  Higher  Malay Centres to which  students  who  are

studying in schools close by come to as well.  Our assessment is

that  the  geographical  spread and the number  of  schools  are

adequate, but if there is a need we will be prepared to increase

the number of centres.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, does the Ministry have

any  other plans to help create the Malay cultural elite through

schools?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> When we were discussing the Chinese

Language  review  the Ministry has indicated that  it  would  be

prepared  to consider a language elective programme in Malay  at

the junior college level if there is a demand for this.  We have

to study this.  Some of the other measures which we were talking

about  include  the  bonus points for entry to  courses  in  the

university  where  Higher Mother Tongue  would  be  useful,  for

example, in communications studies.  These things would apply to

all the mother tongue languages, whether it is Chinese, Malay or

Tamil.  This is still in discussion with the universities.

<div align="center"><b>SPECIAL ASSISTANCE PLAN SCHOOL IN NORTHERN PART OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Harun A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether his Ministry will build a Special Assistance Plan  (SAP)

school in the northern part of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has

recently  announced the establishment of a 10th SAP school,  Nan

Hua  Secondary School, in the west zone.  This, and the existing

<br><br>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAP schools, have sufficient capacity and geographical spread

to  meet the needs of students who qualify for and wish to study

in SAP schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is currently no SAP school in the north zone,

students living in the north can choose schools which are

accessible by public transport, like Catholic High School and

CHIJ St. Nicholas.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, why was Nan Hua

Secondary  School  chosen  and not some  other  schools  in  the

northern part?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> We did a study of the pattern of

students  who  may  be eligible to take Higher  Chinese  and  we

looked at where the current SAP schools are, and we decided that

Nan  Hua  was  the school which was in the correct  geographical

location  to  cater  for these students as well  as  having  the

appropriate history, characteristics and community support which

would help to make it successful as a SAP school.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A Ghani:</b> Sir, how many non-Chinese students

are  there  in  that school and were they given a place  in  the

school which they wanted to go?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Nan Hua currently has 134 non-Chinese

students  studying  in the school across all  levels.   This  is

about  10% of the entire population of the school.  The existing

students  will not be disadvantaged in any way and  the  current

arrangement for instruction in the other mother tongue languages

will continue.

<div align="center"><b>SCHEME B BUS OPERATORS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Amalgamation into a limited company)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Communications

if he will consider amalgamating into a limited company Scheme B

bus operators so as to serve the public better.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Scheme  B  bus  operators are mainly individual operators  whose

main  business is to provide chartering and school bus services.

They  also  serve some of the scheduled bus routes  during  peak

hours  to supplement the two major bus operators, SBS and  TIBS.

My  Ministry  does not see the need for them  to  amalgamate  in

order to improve their services.  Nevertheless, there is nothing

to  prevent  them  to amalgamate on their own if  they  find  it

advantageous to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the

Minister  consider,  like the taxi drivers who  were  individual

operators  and the system has benefited because of amalgamation,

that  it  would be a good idea to encourage these Scheme  B  bus

operators to form a company even if they are not coming on their

own?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, at the moment, there are

already  two bus companies, SBS and TIBS.  They cover the  whole

of  Singapore  quite adequately.  These Scheme B  buses  are  to

supplement their services for some routes where there is demand.

It is a different situation compared to the taxi industry in the

earlier days where you had individual taxi drivers and in  order

to  organise the industry there was a need then to help them  to

come together to form a cooperative.  But here it is a different

situation and there is really no need for us to do that  because

they are the niche service, so to speak.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Report of purchases by Senior Minister and Deputy Prime</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he

will make available to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>

the House the report of the Minister for Finance on

the purchases by the Senior Minister and by the Deputy Prime

Minister BG Lee Hsien Loong of apartments in Nassim Jade and

Scotts 28.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau) (for the</b>

<b>Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I

would like to reply on behalf of the Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP has asked the Prime Minister to make available to

the  House  my report to the Prime Minister on the purchases  by

the Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee Hsien Loong

of properties in Nassim Jade and Scotts 28.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to clarify that there is no single

report  as  such.   On  21st  March  1996,  the  Prime  Minister

instructed  me  to  investigate  market  talk  suggesting   that

improprieties may have been involved in the purchases  and  that

HPL  may  have  violated  SES  rules  in  the  transactions.   I

instructed   Mr   Koh   Beng  Seng  of  MAS   to   conduct   the

investigations.   He  reported to  me  his  conclusion  that  no

improprieties were involved in the purchases and  that  HPL  had

not  contravened  SES rules, and I informed the  Prime  Minister

accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, this House had an extensive debate on the

circumstances  surrounding the Senior  Minister  and  DPM  Lee's

purchases  of the HPL properties over three days on  21st,  22nd

and  23rd  May 1996.  At these sittings, both the Prime Minister

and I gave statements to the House on the investigations carried

out  and our conclusions.  Senior Minister and DPM Lee also made

statements explaining their purchases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that the NCMP carefully reads his Hansard.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> The Minister

says  there  was  no single report.  Are we to  understand  that

there were a series of reports made to the Prime Minister or are

we  to  understand that the purchases were simply  discussed  at

informal meetings between him and the Prime Minister?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> As I mentioned in my

reply earlier, the reports were made to me by Mr Koh Beng Seng

and there were several reports.  The Prime Minister was informed

accordingly.  No evidence was found of any improprieties and

that was quite evident from the debates which had taken place.

May I suggest to the NCMP that he no longer waste this House's

time in raising this issue which is for his political agenda.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am grateful to the Hon. Minister for his

suggestion but I think he should leave it to the Party and to me

to make our own judgment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the statement of the Prime Minister at this

debate.   May  I  ask - I do not know whether the  Minister  for

Finance  can answer this - why was the suggestion of the  Senior

Minister for a Commission of Inquiry not followed up?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> There was no evidence whatsoever

from  Mr Koh Beng Seng's report to justify any such action.   It

would  be  a waste of time.  Are you suggesting that Mr  Koh  is

incompetent in his investigations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I tell the Minister that he should not

be  asking me questions.  I am here to ask the questions.  Would

the Minister agree that Parliament is not a forum for an inquiry

and  that  if  the public had to be satisfied, a  Commission  of

Inquiry would have been the proper forum?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> If Parliament is not the proper

forum,  I  do  not know what is, especially in the circumstances

where there is no prima facie evidence of any improprieties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I think the

Minister  for  Finance has made a very stinging statement  about

the  Opposition.  It does not mean that whenever the  Opposition

asks  awkward questions, it is done for a political reason.   We

are  here  to  ask questions and the Minister should  thank  the

Opposition  Members  for asking awkward questions  so  that  all

these issues can be cleared up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, what is your

supplementary question on this subject?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I think it is unfair of the

Minister to make that statement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> May I respond to Mr Chiam? I was

not  in  any way referring to him or his Party.  I was referring

specifically to one individual.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> And to the Workers' Party. May I ask the

Minister  whether he will agree that greater transparency  which

the  Government proclaims is the desired object or necessary for

good government would have been achieved by a full Commission of

Inquiry with the public hearing the whole evidence that is  laid

before the Commission and deciding for themselves?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I fully agree on the need for

transparency  but three days of debate in Parliament  should  be

more than adequate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister agree that satisfaction

by  the Prime Minister, albeit by the Prime Minister, is not the

same as satisfaction of the public?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It has nothing to do with the

satisfaction of the Prime Minister.  I say it again  that  there

is  no prima facie evidence of anything that has gone wrong.  So

why  are  you pursuing the subject, especially when  your  Party

Member has had the opportunity during the debate to raise  these

same questions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can you proceed with your next

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> As you please, Sir. Question No. 5.

<div align="center"><b>MR HO JUAN THAI</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Non-issue of passport)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

what  are  the  reasons for the reluctance  of  the  Immigration

authorities to issue Mr Ho Juan Thai a passport.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc.

Prof.  Ho  Peng  Kee) (for the Minister for Home  Affairs):   Mr

Jeyaretnam   is  fully  aware  of  the  reasons  why   Singapore

Immigration  and Registration (SIR) has not issued  Mr  Ho  Juan

Thai a passport.  Mr Jeyaretnam had been closely associated with

Mr  Ho, a member of the Workers' Party, and had acted as Mr Ho's

counsel previously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR has not issued Mr Ho a Singapore passport for the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Mr Ho is required to respond to SIR's queries over the

renewal  endorsement in his expired Singapore passport.   Mr  Ho

had  publicly declared that he amended the expiry  date  of  his

passport,  which expired in December 1976, to enter  the  UK  in

July  1977.  If this is true, this may constitute an offence  of

forgery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Mr Ho has been an Exit Permit defaulter since August 1986.

He  is  therefore required to answer for his Exit Permit offence

upon his return to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Although no warrant of arrest has been issued against Mr

Ho,  the  authorities  would  like to  interview  him  over  his

racially  inflammatory speeches at election rallies  during  the

December  1976 General Election in which he ran as the  Workers'

Party election candidate in Bukit Panjang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam, acting as counsel for Mr Ho, was informed in

1986  why  Mr Ho could not be issued a passport.  Mr Ho  himself

was  informed  of the reasons in writing by the  Singapore  High

Commissioner in London and MINDEF in 1992, when he applied for a

new Singapore passport.   The High Commissioner has also told Mr

Ho  that  SIR  is ready to issue him with a one-way Document  of

Identity to facilitate his return to Singapore if he so wishes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister identify the provision

of  law  under  which a citizen of Singapore  can  be  denied  a

passport?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think Mr Jeyaretnam very

well knows the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>

answer.  It is found in the Passports Act, read with

the Passport Regulations (Regulation 5).

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If Mr Ho has committed any offence, the

answer  is to prosecute him and ask for extradition of him  from

the  United  Kingdom  to  Singapore.  I  take  it  there  is  an

extradition treaty.  Why deny him a passport?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> That is exactly what we want to

find out and have asked him to return.  We are prepared to issue

him a Document of Identity for him to return to Singapore, after

which the authorities would question him to ascertain whether or

not  he  has committed any offence and, if so, what offences  he

has committed.  So, Mr Ho should come back and we can get to the

bottom of it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> The Minister of State also

says that the agency would like to interview or question him.  I

would like to know whether or not the Government still considers

Mr Ho Juan Thai a threat to the internal security of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> That is the very reason why we

want  to  interview  him.   He has to come  back,  he  would  be

interviewed, and then we would decide.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister, following the

Member's question, what is the threat that Mr Ho poses?   Is  it

the  same  threat that the Worker's Party poses to the  People's

Action Party?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I have outlined the circumstances

why  the  authorities want to question Mr Ho.  There  are  three

instances and they are all in the answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he really

thinks that he has answered the question?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The answer is obvious.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, if you have no more questions,

could you proceed with your next question?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, all right, because we are

not getting the answers, Sir, Question No. 6.

<div align="center"><b>MR ABDUL RAZAK B AHMAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Denial of entry into Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether there are any good reasons for denying Mr Abdul Razak  b

Ahmad entry into Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home</b>

<b>Affairs):</b> Abdul Razak Ahmad, a Malaysian, was expelled and

banned  from  entering Singapore with effect from 18th  November

1966,  because  he  took  part  in subversive  activities  while

studying at the Law Faculty of Singapore University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entry into any country is a privilege and not a right

granted  to foreigners.  It is the view of this Government  that

Abdul  Razak is an undesirable person who should not be  granted

the privilege of entering Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister say why this Order was

made  against him?  Was it not because he was part  of  a  group

asking for greater academic freedom in the universities in those

days?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I have said in my answer, he

has  engaged in subversive activities.  Abdul Razak was actively

involved in the Nanyang University students' agitation  for  the

restoration of the Nanyang University Students' Union  and  also

in  Ngee Ann College's agitation in 1966 for the college  to  be

made  a  full-fledged  university.   This  resulted  in  several

processions,  demonstrations and indeed a violent clash  between

students and the riot Police.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister of State say whether a

demand  for  greater  academic freedom in  the  universities  is

considered  by the Government to be a threat to the security  of

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, it was not just a matter of

debate about more freedom.  As I have said in my answer,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>

there were demonstrations, processions and fights.  So

it is a different thing altogether.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What is wrong with them in maintaining

their protests by way of demonstrations, if it was necessary?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam is in this

House,  using our time to espouse the cause of a foreigner  who,

in 1966, participated in certain acts which were a destabilising

factor in Singapore, and after that he also had in several  ways

made  several  unfriendly  remarks.   And  indeed  in  1986,  he

instigated  and led a protest against Singapore  over  the  then

Israeli President Chaim Herzog's visit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> May I ask the Minister whether Abdul

Razak  applied  to the Government to review the Order?   Has  he

himself  applied?  The second question is whether the Government

would  consider, in view of the changed circumstances,  allowing

him entry on conditions?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> After the ban was made in 1966,

in  fact,  he  was  allowed in Singapore on four  occasions  for

various  reasons.  He did apply to ask for the ban to be lifted,

but the Government in 1984 turned it down.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Would the Minister consider, in view of

the changed circumstances, whether it is still a risk to let him

come in?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> He has not applied. If he

applies,  we can consider it.  But in terms of what he has  done

in 1966, the reason for the ban is fully justifiable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister explain why another

student,  Mr  Chan Kian Hui who was also sent out of  Singapore,

had  that Order revoked after a month's time, when Mr Razak  has

been prevented from coming in all these years?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> If Mr Jeyaretnam files a

question, I will give a reply.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It was mentioned that Abdul

Razak was arrested for agitating the conversion of Ngee Ann

College to a full-fledged university.  May I ask what is wrong

with that?  Does it affect the security of a country?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I have mentioned, it is not

just about making a point for raising the status of the College,

but  what he did was he was involved in certain agitations which

resulted in processions, demonstrations, fights and riots.   And

he is a foreigner too.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he was

prosecuted  for  these  riots  and  fights?   Why  was  he   not

prosecuted?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> One wonders why Mr Jeyaretnam is

spending  so  much time of the House espousing  his  cause.   Is

there some interest?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I remind the Minister that it is not

for  him  to  ask  me  questions.  We know  that  banishment  or

prohibition  orders against several other people have  all  been

revoked or taken back.  Why is this man in particular?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, surely the circumstances

must  be  different.  Just because some orders have been revoked

does not mean that we must do it for this man.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Encik Harun A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for

Communications if he will consider lowering the Electronic  Road

Pricing fines for motorcyclists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Communications  (Dr  Yaacob  Ibrahim)  (for  the  Minister   for

Communications):  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the ERP  system  requires  a

motorist who uses an ERP expressway or road to install an IU  in

his   vehicle  and  insert  a  CashCard  of  sufficient   value.

Therefore,   motorists   as  well  as  motorcyclists  who  drive

through  an  Electronic  Road Pricing (ERP)  gantry  during  the

operating  hours without an In-Vehicle Unit (IU) and a  CashCard

of  sufficient  value in the IU are committing an  offence.   We

should not impose different penalties for the same offence as it

is  only  fair  that all offenders are treated equally,  whether

they drive a car, a lorry or ride a motorcycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, LTA will continue to consider all appeals

against ERP offences on the merits of each case.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A Ghani:</b> Sir, how many motorcyclists have been

summoned up to date?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, from November 1998 to January 1999,

out  of  a population of 132,385 motorcyclists, only 6,740  have

committed ERP offences.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A Ghani:</b> Sir, there is a difference between

motorcycles and motorcars.  Motorcycles are fitted with IUs  but

the CashCard can be stolen easily if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>

they forget to take it out.  Could the Ministry invent

an IU so that the CashCard could be safe?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I am sure that if there is such a

unit in the market, we will consider it seriously.  But the best

way to prevent theft is actually to remove the card after it has

been used.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A Ghani:</b> Sir, it is because of theft that I

have asked for a lower fine for motorcyclists.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, on the whole, we have been fair to

all  users  of  the  ERP.  As and when they  have  committed  an

offence,  LTA  has  exercised  a lot  of  flexibility  in  their

appeals.   In  fact,  just to add to the  numbers  that  I  have

mentioned  earlier,  out  of  the  6,000-odd  motorcyclists  who

committed  ERP  offences,  about 1,500  appealed  and  725  were

actually successful in their appeals.

<div align="center"><b>INFECTIOUS DISEASES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Infectious Diseases

Act (Chapter 137 of the 1985 Revised Edition) and the Infectious

Diseases (Amendment) Act 1992, to strengthen the public health

control of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Infectious Diseases Act was passed in 1976 to prevent

the  introduction  and  spread of  all  infectious  diseases  in

Singapore.   AIDS, which is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency

Virus  (HIV),  became a notifiable disease under the  Infectious

Diseases  Act in 1985.  In 1992, the Act was amended to  include

provisions to tighten the control of AIDS and to provide for the

confidentiality of infected persons.   However, changing  trends

of  HIV  infection in recent years require us  to  make  further

amendments  to the Act in order to strengthen the public  health

control  of  AIDS  in Singapore.  Before I go into  the  details

about  the  Bill,  let me brief the House on  these  trends  and

therefore the need for changes to the existing law.

<br><br><i>HIV/AIDS situation in Singapore</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of HIV infected Singaporeans has been increasing over

the  years since 1985 when the first case was reported.  Between

1985  and 1990, a total of 61 cases were reported.  The rate  of

increase  has  accelerated since then.  In 1991  alone,  42  new

cases  of  HIV/AIDS were reported, as against the  total  of  61

cases  between 1985-1990.  Over the last four years, the  number

of  cases  shot up to more than 100 per year.  Last year,  1998,

the number climbed to nearly 200.  The exact number was 199.  In

total,  there were 930 Singapore residents notified  to  be  HIV

infected  between  1985 and 1998, of whom 423  had  asymptomatic

infection, 196 had full blown AIDS and 311 had passed away.   In

addition, a total of 2,813 foreigners had been tested to be  HIV

positive  while  they  were in Singapore.   About  80%  of  such

foreigners were work permit holders and applicants.   They  have

already left Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern of transmission of the HIV infection has

changed   over  the  years,  from  a  predominantly   homosexual

infection to one that is mostly spread by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



heterosexual transmission.  Over the last three years,

heterosexual transmission accounted for an average of 78% of all

new cases.  Most of these cases had unprotected sex with

prostitutes and casual acquaintances in Singapore or abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern of heterosexual infection itself has also

changed.  The proportion of married men among new cases  of  HIV

infection among male Singaporeans has increased from 10% in 1991

to 30% in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this shift of the infection to the married population,

infected men are bringing the infection home to their wives.   A

further  tragic  consequence  is that  there  are  more  reports

recently of children with HIV infection.  The first HIV infected

child  was reported in 1991.  Since then, eight more cases  have

been  reported  between 1997 and l998.  All of  them  have  been

infected perinatally.   Families have been devastated by the HIV

infection.  We have had at least two families where all  members

were infected.  This emerging trend needs to be addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major concern that has arisen recently is HIV

transmission  through blood transfusion.  In 1997,  my  Ministry

reported  the  first  case  of  HIV transmission  through  blood

transfusion.  Two  persons became infected after  they  received

blood  from  a  donor who was in the window period  of  the  HIV

infection.  This is despite the stringent measures taken by  the

Singapore  Blood Transfusion Services (SBTS) to  exclude  donors

with risk factors because the donor had lied in this case.   The

HIV  infected  donor admitted to a total of six  offences  under

section  182  of the Penal Code.  He was charged in court  early

last  year  and given a sentence of 12 months.  This penalty  is

hardly  commensurate with the harm the donor had caused  to  the

two recipients who received his blood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, my Ministry was also notified of a health care

worker  who  was  HIV infected.   All the health  care  worker's

patients,  who  were  exposed  to  the  risk  of  acquiring  the

infection through clinical procedures that were carried  out  on

them,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>

were informed, counselled and offered HIV screening.

This look back programme to trace the contacts of the health

care worker cost my Ministry $400,000.  Fortunately, none was

infected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the changing pattern of transmission of HIV

infection  in  Singapore,  we have  to  address  these  new  and

emerging  issues  pertaining  to the  HIV  infection  here.   My

Ministry  has  reviewed the law and put  up  new  strategies  to

ensure that the health of our people is not compromised.  Timely

actions  need  to  be  taken to prevent further  spread  of  the

disease  within  the population.  My Ministry  has  studied  the

existing  Infectious  Diseases  Act  and  has  proposed  several

amendments  to  the existing Act to tighten the control  of  HIV

infection in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several countries responding to the AIDS epidemic, like the

United  States,  Britain  and  Australia,  have  legislation  to

protect  the  public.  Legislation in these countries  has  been

enacted  to  allow for the disclosure of the  HIV  status  of  a

patient  to  the spouse, sexual partner or contact.   Provisions

have also been made for disclosure to health care providers  and

other  personnel  who had come in contact  with  blood  or  body

fluids of an infected person, and to the next of kin upon  death

of  the  infected  person as well as in the interest  of  public

health  if  it  is threatened.  Even in the United States  where

there  were earlier laws to protect the civil liberties  of  HIV

infected  persons,  new  legislation has  been  introduced  more

recently  to identify, notify and make it an offence  for  those

who  intentionally  place  others at  risk  of  contracting  the

infection.

<br><br><i>Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a person who furnishes false information at the Blood

Bank is charged under section 182 of the Penal Code.  This

carries a maximum penalty of $1,000 and/or a maximum jail

sentence of six months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to make this an offence under the

Infectious   Diseases  Act  so  that  the  appropriate   penalty

commensurate with the severity of the offence can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>

be meted out.  In the Amendment Bill, under a new

section 10A, it is an offence to furnish false or misleading

information in relation to the donation of blood.  The maximum

penalty under this section is a fine of $20,000 or a term of

imprisonment not exceeding two years or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequent to such a new provision, section 20C of the

principal  Act is amended to raise the penalty for a person  who

knows that he is HIV infected and yet donates blood or does  any

act  that is likely to result in the spread of the disease  from

$10,000 to $50,000.

<br><br><i>Exceptions to Medical Confidentiality</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity of the person with AIDS/HIV infection is

protected   under  section  20D  of  the  existing  Act,   where

disclosure  of  identity  and HIV  status  is  allowed  only  to

specified  categories of persons.  To address the public  health

issues that have arisen over recent years which I have described

just  now,  my Ministry proposes that new exceptions to  medical

confidentiality  be included.  The main objective  of  such  new

exceptions  is to prevent transmission of the infection  through

irresponsible behaviour by persons who are infected and to allow

those  who have been exposed to the risk of the infection to  be

informed early, counselled and tested.  With the availability of

newer  anti-retroviral drugs, early diagnosis  will  allow  such

victims to be treated to delay the progress to full blown  AIDS.

The  treatment will also allow for a better quality of  life  on

the part of the patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7(d) of the Amendment Bill, new provisions

have been provided to allow the disclosure of the HIV status and

the  identity of the HIV infected person to his/her  spouse  and

contacts.    This  amendment  is  to  cater  to  the  increasing

incidence  of  HIV  infection among married persons.   From  our

experience, the infected person is sometimes reluctant to inform

the  spouse or contact despite numerous counselling sessions and

advice  from  the  doctors.  Some have even refused  to  do  so.

Under  the  existing  Act, my Ministry is  unable  to  take  any

further

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>

action should the patient refuse to inform his or her

spouse or contact.  The new provision will allow the doctor to

disclose the HIV status of the patient to the spouse or contact

if the patient refuses to do so despite repeated counselling by

the doctor.  My Ministry strongly views that the spouse or

contact who has been exposed to the risk of infection has a

right to know so that they can be counselled and screened for

the infection.  Those who are not infected can take the

necessary precautions to protect themselves against any further

exposure to the HIV while those who may be infected will have a

chance to undergo anti-retroviral therapy while they are in the

early stages of the infection and make the relevant choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for infected wives who are pregnant, early

diagnosis will allow a choice to abort the pregnancy or to  take

prophylactic  measures to prevent transmission  of  HIV  to  the

baby.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to counsel those who are infected

on  the  importance  of  disclosure so that  they  inform  their

spouses  and  contacts themselves and to bring them forward  for

counselling and screening.  However, we will need to apply  this

legal provision if the counselling fails.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7(d) of the Amendment Bill also enables the disclosure of

the identity of a HIV infected person to the health care workers

who have previously treated him/her, or to any other person who,

in  the  act of rendering emergency assistance to a HIV infected

person, has therefore been exposed to the risk of infection with

the HIV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other new provisions under clause 7(c) of the Amendment

Bill  would  allow my Ministry to disclose the identity  of  HIV

infected  foreigners  to the Controller of Immigration  for  the

purposes of the Immigration Act, and the disclosure to the  next

of kin of the HIV infected person in the event of death, because

special  burial  arrangements have to be  made  to  ensure  that

public health is safeguarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Amendment Bill, the Minister is empowered to

authorise the publication of information which may identify  the

HIV infected person in instances where the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>

health or safety of the public is threatened.  I would

like to assure the House that this provision would only be

evoked under extreme circumstances, such as when an infected

person wilfully continues to place others at risk of contracting

the infection,  and the disclosure can only be done with the

Minister's approval.

<br><br><i>Re-disclosure of information</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that there is no abuse despite the increase in

the  categories  of  persons  to whom  information  on  the  HIV

infected  person can be disclosed to, the Bill  has  included  a

provision  under clause 7, subsection 9, in which no  person  to

whom   any  information  on  a  HIV  infected  person  has  been

disclosed,  shall re-disclose such information to anyone  except

to  persons  stipulated in the Act.  Unauthorised  re-disclosure

will  be dealt with seriously.  The penalty is a fine of $10,000

or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, with the increasing incidence and changing

pattern  of  HIV infection in Singapore, the amendments  to  the

Infectious Diseases Act are necessary to ensure that the  health

of   our  people  is  not  compromised.   All  of  us,  doctors,

neighbours  and friends, members of the public, should  continue

to  empathise with HIV patients and their families.  AIDS  is  a

dreadful  disease that causes great suffering and social  stigma

to  the victims and their loved ones.  We must continue to  help

them  and  treat  them humanely and with great  compassion.   My

Ministry   will  ensure  that  the  new  provisions  under   the

Infectious  Diseases Act will not be abused and the  rights  and

confidentiality of the infected person are protected as  far  as

possible.   At the same time, we will continue and step  up  our

public  education on AIDS, so that all Singaporeans will  become

fully  aware of the danger of the infection and take  preventive

measures to avoid the risk of being infected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act

will enable my Ministry to step up the public health control  of

AIDS in Singapore.  It will help

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>

to prevent further transmission of the infection among

the population, and allow those who may be innocently infected

to seek screening and early treatment.   It will also enhance

further the safety of our national blood supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

amendments proposed by the Senior Minister of State.  The Senior

Minister  of State has mentioned about the rise in incidence  of

AIDS  in  Singapore, which is alarming by itself.   But  let  me

refer  Members to some statistics for the world which point  out

even more starkly the spread of AIDS.  Many of us are aware that

the  spread of AIDS is increasing but not to the extent that  is

being done in certain areas.  For example, this survey was  done

by  Time magazine and published in the Annual 1996.  The  number

of people living with HIV AIDS in North America as at the end of

1996  amounted to 750,000 people.  The change from 1992 to  1996

was  minus  13%.   That  means, they have  actually  a  reducing

incidence of people with AIDS.  Maybe they died.  The  death  in

1996  was 61,000.  In Western Europe, the total number of people

with  AIDS is half a million.  The change from 1992 to  1996  is

2%, and death in 1996 was 10,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that at least, for the time being, the increase in

AIDS  in  people has stabilised for the developed  countries  in

North America and Western Europe.  In the Sub-Sahara Africa area

where  AIDS  started actually, the number of people living  with

AIDS  now  amounted to 14 million.  Changes from 1992  to  1996,

37%;  and  death in 1996, 783,000. The interesting  one  is  for

South and South-east Asia.  By this, I think India and Pakistan,

and  also  all parts of Southeast Asia included, the  number  of

people  living with AIDS and HIV is 5.2 million.  But the change

between  1992 and 1996 was 261%, which is the highest among  all

the  continents; and death in 1996 was 43,000.   This  could  be

because  of detection, but the high increase could not hide  the

fact  that the spread of AIDS in this region is getting  out  of

control.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is particularly vulnerable because we

are exposed to the region.  We have people coming into Singapore

in far greater numbers, and Singaporeans are travelling abroad

even more frequently.  The possibility of being affected by this

disease will be only increasing with time, rather than

lessening.  Therefore, I fully endorse the Ministry's policy to

enhance the punishment for not revealing this illness to the

spouses or contacts and to empower our Immigration Officers to

be on the lookout for foreigners coming in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishments recommended are not as harsh as those under

the Misuse of Drugs Act.  In fact, AIDS is worse than drugs.  It

is a death sentence.  The moment you get it, that is it.  And if

we   are  so  conscious  in  controlling  drug  abuse  and  drug

trafficking,  and we have been successful at it,  all  the  more

reason we should make sure that we apply the same methods to  an

even  more dangerous disease - AIDS.  Therefore, I fully support

the enhanced punishment proposed by the Ministry.  But, I think,

ultimately, it is much better to look at prevention rather  than

cure.   In  this  case,  cure  is  not  even  secure.   Whatever

punishment  you have is only after the event.  As  the  Minister

says, it is better to see how we can prevent the disease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us into the social realm. The Government cannot

legislate this.  The best thing to do it is, as the Chinese say,

if  you  do not want people to know about it, do not do it.   If

you  do  not want it to happen to you, do not do it.  The  first

thing is if we can maintain spouse fidelity, we will never  have

a  chance of passing any of these things to our children, to our

wives and to the children; a proper lifestyle, perhaps, when you

travel  to  countries where the incidence of AIDS is very  high.

But  these are human behaviour which the Government cannot force

on  our people because they have the freedom of choice.  But HIV

to  me  is  almost a death sentence which in this case not  only

affects  oneself, it affects all those with whom they come  into

contact.   I do not think the Government will take much  joy  in

getting more revenue from fines.  That is the least of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>

problem.  But I think the more adverse impact coming

from this is: should AIDS spread through the children, through

the spouses and families, the resultant social problems that

arise would be a much bigger price to pay.  And I think we

should do what we can to ensure that this is minimised.  The

message to Singaporeans at large is the laws are meant to

protect you but, ultimately, you have got to protect yourself.

The Government cannot do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to declare my interest.  I am a family practitioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosing patients' medical records is a breach of medical

confidentiality.  Medical confidentiality is the cornerstone  of

medical practice, that is, we doctors never reveal any patient's

problem even to close relatives who call up to find out what  is

wrong,  unless  the patient's consent has been given,  and  this

builds  up trust between a patient and his doctor.  However,  as

disease  patterns  change, and new illnesses, like  AIDS,  which

pose  a danger to the society at large, doctors are prepared  to

compromise  and  surrender their medical  confidentiality  under

very special circumstances.  This is for the better good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, amongst others, seeks for more exceptions to

medical  confidentiality with regard to patients suffering  from

AIDS,  Human  Immunodeficiency disease.   But  in  seeking  this

breach  of  confidentiality, this Bill  very  carefully  avoided

indiscriminate disclosures by imposing strict guidelines  as  to

who,  when  and  how these disclosures can be  made.   Thus,  in

section 20D of the Infectious Diseases Act, and under clause  7,

amendments to section 20D of the original Act, there is  a  list

of  personnel and departments where such disclosures can be made

under certain conditions.  This is very reassuring and I support

the amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me bring Members to the attention on the

Explanatory Statement on pages 6 and 7.  This is where I want to

seek  clarification  from the Minister.   If  you  look  at  the

Explanatory Statement in the two

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>

pages I have mentioned, there is a phrase "any other

sexually transmitted disease".  It is not present in the

Amendment Bill itself.  Thus, clause 7, which amends section

20D, as stated in the Explanatory Statement, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'provide for more exceptions to medical confidentiality [in

subsection (1)] in relation to information that would identify a

person who is suffering from AIDS, Human Immunodeficiency  Virus

Infection or any other sexually transmitted disease.'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this last phrase "any other sexually

transmitted  disease" is all encompassing.   Unlike  AIDS,  many

sexually   transmitted  diseases  are  not  fatal  with   modern

management of the illnesses and thus pose no serious  danger  to

society.   Take,  for  example, this Protozoa  infection  called

Trichomonas. It is sexually transmitted but easily treatable and

is  fairly  common even among married couples.  I  am  not  sure

whether,  according  to what I interpret  from  the  Explanatory

Statement,   that  this  Trichomonas  infection  needs   to   be

disclosed.  In fact, I wonder why this particular statement  was

introduced in this Bill.  It seems to be out of place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original Act, the Infectious Diseases Act (Chapter 137),

all  infectious  diseases  listed in a  specific  form  must  be

notified to the Ministry.  And this is correct, as it allows the

medical  body  to  monitor  the  pattern  and  spread  of  these

diseases.   I have a form here for Members who want to  know  or

want  to see it.  They can come and see me afterwards.  In  this

form, there was no mention of Trichomonas infection.  Therefore,

to   make  matters  clearer  and  to  avoid  any  ambiguity   in

interpretation in the future, I would suggest that  we  add  the

word  "designated" before "sexually", so that the  phrase  would

now  read:  "any other designated sexually transmitted disease".

I  think this is much clearer.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is

now  run  by non-doctors at the top as administrators.  If  they

choose  to interpret the Bill according to what is stated,  then

we  may  face  problems in future, and this goes for  the  other

future medical Bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish our Bills can be drafted in a manner which

is easy for lay people like myself to follow.  The number

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>

of times I have to turn the pages to understand which

section relates to which, and which clause must be inserted into

which statement, I find all this tiring.  I am sure in my

discussion today when I mentioned those sections, some of you

are also quite blur.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess that each

time I read a Bill, I find that to get a coherent understanding

it eats too much into my time and understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Amendment Bill and hope the

Minister will look into what I have suggested, that is,

inserting the word "designated" before "sexually".

<div align="center"><b>INFECTIOUS DISEASES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to declare that I am a medical practitioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand to support the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Bill. In

my  opinion,  the  amendments  in this  Bill  will  give  better

protection  of  the public with regard to Human Immunodeficiency

Virus  (or  HIV) infection.  We know that there is  no  cure  at

present  for  those  suffering  from  Acquired  Immunodeficiency

Syndrome  (or  AIDS) because of HIV infection.   Therefore,  any

improvement towards protecting innocent people, through no fault

of  their own, from getting the deadly HIV infection, is welcome

news.  Indeed, I believe that having stringent measures in place

to  deter  inconsiderate or ignorant people from harming  others

through  HIV infection is prudent and timely.  I agree  with  my

parliamentary  colleague, Mr Bernard Chen, that  the  action  by

such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>

people amounts to giving their victims the death

sentence and such action, whether intentional or inadvertent,

must be considered illegal, to say the least.  Sir, I would like

to contribute the following concerning the amendments:

<br><br><i>Insertion of new section 10A</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insertion of this section 10A to create an offence when

blood donors supply false or misleading information and to set a

maximum  penalty under this section as a fine of  $20,000  or  a

term  of  imprisonment  of two years or both  is  necessary  and

timely.   It is necessary because there is this `window  period'

when  presently  available  tests cannot  detect  an  early  HIV

infection.   Although with new technology, this `window  period'

will become shorter, it is extremely important that blood donors

give  truthful  information,  through  detailed  questionnaires.

This is, unfortunately, still the only way to minimise the risks

of  innocent blood recipients from being infected.  It is timely

because  any means of deterring a repeat of that tragic incident

in  1997, as mentioned earlier by the Senior Minister of  State,

when  two  blood recipients contracted HIV infection  because  a

blood  donor  had  lied about his promiscuous  habits,  is  most

welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people may argue that such strict deterrents will

result in fewer much needed blood donors.  However, much  as  we

need  blood  donors,  the  safety of blood  recipients  must  be

protected  as  a  matter of highest priority.  The  majority  of

blood  donors  volunteer as good Samaritans.  They  want  to  be

contributing  a good service to the society.  They  want  to  be

saving someone's life.  With such good intentions at heart,  the

severe penalty imposed on errant donors will not interfere  with

their willingness to continue as blood donors.  It is necessary,

however, for the public to be assured that the intent is not  to

penalise blood donors liberally but to dissuade those with  high

risks  to  abstain from blood donation.  I hope the Ministry  of

Health can step up in its campaign in this area.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Amendment to section 20C</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this section provides an enhanced penalty of up to

$50,000  in  fine  where  a person who knows  that  he  has  HIV

infection  or AIDS donates blood or does any act that is  likely

to  result  in the spreading or transmission of those  diseases.

Although  it is good to have this clause, the resultant  effects

would depend on the next task for the Ministry of Health.   This

task  would  be  to  ensure  that the targeted  group  gets  the

message.  For example, the warning about the penalty may need to

be  prominently  marked  on  the blood transfusion  registration

forms;  the  warning may have to be posted in the wards  of  the

Communicable Disease Hospital and the same warning may  need  to

be  clearly explained to newly diagnosed HIV patients.  Sir,  my

question   to  the  Senior  Minister  of  State  is,  in   those

recalcitrant cases that do not heed any warning and are  callous

in  their  behaviour  within society,  what  further  preventive

measures  can  be  meted  out?  Could these  offenders  be  made

discretely identifiable to the relevant authorities or  persons?

Could  these  offenders  be forcibly  put  behind  bars?   Since

confidentiality will be an issue here, who with  the  privileged

information can report them?

<br><br><i>Amendment of section 20D</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments here include the addition of four more

exceptions to medical confidentiality for HIV infected  patients

in  subsection  1  and the insertion of new subsection  (12)  to

provide  for  medical  confidentiality  and  disclosure  of  the

identity  of infected patients.  Mr Speaker, Sir, such  a  large

list  of  new  provisos  indicates the  tremendous  difficulties

involved in this very sensitive issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly inserted subsection (6) allows medical

practitioners to disclose information identifying  the  infected

person  to his spouse, former spouse or other persons  who  have

experienced  a  significant risk by being in contact  with  him.

This  is  welcome  news especially when these  contacts  of  the

inflicted  may  generally  be  the  highest  at  risk  of  being

infected.  Among 90% of the known cases

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>

in Singapore are males.  In 1998, there were 830 males

with HIV infection and in the past two years, eight children

were detected to have HIV infection.  Sir, I feel this amendment

may help lessen the number of females and children from

potential infection.  The argument against this new subsection

may be that people who suspect they themselves may have HIV

infection would be reluctant to come forward for fear of being

disclosed.  This, however, has been addressed through certain

safeguards.  One of them is the requirement for the medical

practitioner to counsel and inform the infected person of his

intent to make such disclosure to the spouse, former spouse, or

other contacts.  Otherwise the medical practitioner shall be

guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine

not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding

three months or to both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask if the Senior Minister

of State would consider three further aspects on this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Not included for a further consideration with these

amendments   is   the   subject  of   consent   for   diagnostic

investigations  for  HIV  infection or  AIDS.   I  feel  that  a

responsible  approach together with these  amendments  in  place

should   provide   sufficient   protection   from   breach    of

confidentiality of a person with HIV infection or AIDS.  Sir, on

the other hand, it is important to protect those who are at risk

of exposure and it is important to protect the public by keeping

the infectious disease from spreading.  The ease to diagnose, to

identify  and to treat the infected and their contacts would  be

the  key  to effectively deal with these aspects.  HIV infection

or  AIDS  should be treated like any other infectious  diseases.

The consent for diagnostic tests should be implied when a person

gives  general consent for medical or surgical treatment.  There

should not be a need for specific consent.  Only then, Sir,  can

all those involved in the management of the disease feel at ease

to  handle  the condition in a normal way.  Only then,  perhaps,

can the infectious disease be effectively managed and contained.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Each country deals with this disease in its

own way and the solutions for one country may not be relevant to

another or to us here.  Sir, though fortunately not an endemic

problem, the incidence of HIV infection or AIDS is increasing in

Singapore.  We should take every measure possible to keep it in

check.  Our population and our problems are unique to us and

there is scope for us to take more stringent and radical steps

to combat the increase of the disease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is a need to inform and advise all doctors and

healthcare  workers  on  new  regulations  pertaining  to  their

profession  in simple terms.  Many of them would not know  about

the  amendments to this Bill and the details contained  therein.

Perhaps  the Ministry of Health would keep all relevant  parties

well informed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Senior Minister of State would enlighten me in

these areas.  Sir, I support the Infectious Diseases (Amendment)

Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for giving

me this opportunity to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having listened to the very moving speech

by the Senior Minister of State in which she painted the picture

of  the AIDS patients, and having heard Mr Bernard Chen who also

graphically  painted  the picture that is emerging,  I  have  no

doubt that this House would support this Amendment Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have moved from the days when we had malaria as an

infectious   disease.   In  fact,  the  first  legislation   was

introduced in 1915 when Singapore was largely a seaport.  Today,

she  has become one of the largest airports in this part of  the

world.   We are getting people from all over the world  and  our

citizens are also travelling.  It is therefore important that we

should legislate and take care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is required is social education. We

have  to  inform the public at large the need to take preventive

measures.    Sir,  section  10A,  which  is  a  new   piece   of

legislation, lays down that any person who supplies any material

information which he knows to be false or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>

misleading may be fined up to $20,000 or imprisonment

for a term not exceeding two years or both.  I think the

existing Penal Code does not have the severity which this Bill

introduces.  I support this amendment because the Penal Code

provisions are really inadequate.  And it is very important for

us to have enough deterrents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I move to section 20C, Sir, I am a bit

apprehensive.  From $10,000, we are increasing to $50,000.  This

is  too  drastic and I hope the Senior Minister  of  State  will

explain  to  the  House the necessity of  taking  such  a  large

quantum move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have spoken on the other details and I do not

want to belabour the points.  Generally, it is important that we

should  have  a  legal framework for medical  practitioners  and

other  officials to work within the framework of law and  it  is

important  that  we lay it down.  I share Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock's

concern.   As a lawyer, I find difficulty in comprehending  this

piece  of legislation.  We are moving to plain language,  and  I

hope that our draftsmen will try to make it as easy as possible.

If we have difficulty, what about the man-in-the-street, Sir?  I

know the Attorney-General has been trying his level best to have

simple  plain  English and I would again urge the  draftsmen  to

have mercy on us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these words, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I would like to thank the Members of the

House  who  spoke in such strong support of this Bill.   We  all

realise that Singapore is open to the world trend of increase in

AIDS/HIV infection, and therefore we must do our utmost  to  try

to  contain  the  problem,  to  prevent  its  spread  among  the

population and to educate people to avoid the risk of infection.

I agree completely with Mr Bernard Chen, Dr Lily Neo and also Mr

Shriniwas Rai that public education is very, very important.  We

will do our best in this respect to help prevent the disease and

its spread.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me address some of the specific points

brought  up  by  my colleagues here.  Dr Tan Cheng  Bock  talked

about  the  Explanatory  Statement  where  "any  other  sexually

transmitted  disease" is mentioned.  He said that he  could  not

find  this  phrase in this Amendment Bill and he  was  concerned

that  this is too blanket a statement which would seem to  allow

the disclosure of a whole range of sexually transmitted diseases

on  the same ground or at par with HIV infection.  Actually this

Amendment Bill is an extension of the 1992 Amendment Act  where,

in section 20D, it is mentioned "or is suffering from a sexually

transmitted  disease" which is any other STD.  I would  like  to

point  out  that there is a reason for this.  By inserting  "any

other  sexually transmitted disease" is to cater for a situation

when,  apart from HIV, some time in the future, we may  discover

another very deadly disease that we have to control on the  same

ground and use the same measures as we control HIV.  So that  is

a  contingency.  But, in practice, as  Dr Tan mentioned, in  the

Notification of Infectious Diseases form, which is gazetted  and

which  every medical doctor receives, it is clearly stated  that

for the other sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhoea,

syphilis, non-gonococco urethritis and so on, there is  no  need

to disclose the full name, the identity card or passport number,

address,  etc,  of  the patient.  The only  exception  for  full

information is on HIV.  I am not sure about the STD that Dr  Tan

mentioned.   I  could  ask my officers to  look  into  this  and

whether it is specifically mentioned in the form.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to add the word "designated" before

"sexually transmitted diseases" in this amendment or in the  law

itself  because it is fully understood that the list of diseases

will  be  gazetted and that the law will apply to these gazetted

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Members have complained about the language of this

Bill.   I will feedback this to the Attorney-General's Chambers.

In fact, I also spent quite a lot of time trying to read through

this Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I address some of Dr Lily Neo's points.

Again, I thank her for supporting this Bill.  As for her point

about the severity of the new penalties on blood donors who give

false information or wilfully donate blood even though they know

of their own HIV status, my Ministry will revise the Donor's

Health Assessment questionnaire to include the new provisions of

the amended Act.  Even in the existing blood Donor Health

Assessment Questionnaire, we have already warned them about the

danger of donating contaminated blood which is not suitable for

transfusion and if they do so, they would be liable to

prosecution and would face serious consequences.  We will update

our Donor's Health Assessment Questionnaire to include the new

penalties and so on, that we have amended today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV patients at the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) are

always  warned  during the counselling sessions that  it  is  an

offence to carry out any act that may transmit HIV infection  to

others,  such  as  sexual intercourse, without  first  informing

their partner of the status, or to donate blood.  Again, in  our

counselling  at  the  CDC, we would make sure  the  counsellers,

doctors  and  nurses  will  inform  the  patients  of  the   new

provisions  in  this Bill.  In the event of a  HIV  patient  who

behaves  carelessly and most irresponsibly, then this  amendment

Bill allows the Minister for Health to disclose the identity  of

the  HIV  infected  person to relevant  persons,  including  the

public,  so  as  to  ensure that public  health  and  safety  is

preserved.   It  is a preventive measure to publish  information

which leads to the identification of the person but it will call

for the Minister's authorisation and it would be done only under

extreme  circumstances  when the person behaves  carelessly  and

most irresponsibly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Neo's comment that there is no need for specific

consent  for HIV testing when a person seeks medical or surgical

treatment,  I  would  like to emphasise that  HIV  infection  is

different from any other infectious diseases in that there is at

present no cure and that it carries a very strong social stigma.

Therefore, HIV

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>

testing and its outcome have a very traumatic  impact

on  the  person.  It is almost like a pronouncement of  a  death

sentence, as some Members have put it.  Persons undergoing  such

tests should therefore be fully aware of the nature of the  test

and  be counselled before and after the HIV test is carried out.

Counselling  is  crucial because it will help the  patient  cope

with  the  situation and help him change his risk behaviour  and

lifestyle to prevent further spreading of the disease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law, it is necessary in all circumstances to obtain

consent  of  the  person before taking his blood for  laboratory

testing.  This includes testing the blood for HIV.  This act, if

done  without  the patient's consent, constitutes a  battery  of

tort  and  an offence of voluntarily causing hurt under  section

323  of the Penal Code.  From the medical ethical point of view,

when  a patient seeks medical attention, doctors have a duty  to

inform  him what tests are being done and what is the nature  of

this  test.   So  this is in the spirit of a good doctor-patient

relationship.  In the case of HIV testing, informed  consent  is

required to also protect the doctor in case there is a denial by

the  patient later.  HIV testing is put on par with  a  surgical

operation  as  it  has serious implications  should  a  positive

result turn out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on her point about the need for more stringent and

radical  steps  to control the spread of AIDS in  Singapore,  we

should  not be complacent about the situation but it is  a  fact

that   the   extent  of  the  AIDS  epidemic  in  Singapore   is

comparatively smaller than many other countries in  the  region,

because we took steps to control the situation very early,  from

the  day  go  in 1985, shortly after AIDS itself was identified.

So,  we  have taken the necessary AIDS control measures  and  we

have been reviewing and fine-tuning the strategies based on  the

changing  trends  of  the HIV infection over the  years.   I  am

confident  that with this amendment Bill, we would  be  able  to

further  tighten  the AIDS control situation for  public  health

purposes in Singapore.  Of course, we will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>

inform all the medical practitioners and health care

workers of the new provisions and keep them updated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me come to Mr Shriniwas Rai's point about the

severity of the penalty.  I think he agrees with the new section

10A,  that  is, for people who give false information when  they

give blood donation, the penalty will be raised to $20,000 or to

imprisonment of two years or both.  But he does not quite  agree

with  section 20C that raises the present penalty for  a  person

who knows that he is HIV-infected but he still insists on giving

blood at our blood bank.  Mr Rai does not agree with raising the

penalty from $10,000 to $50,000.  He said that it is too severe.

I  think  the heavy penalty underscores the seriousness  of  the

crime.   This person has already been counselled against  giving

blood.   He knows about his own HIV status.  He knows it himself

and  he  still persists in donating blood.  When he goes to  the

blood centre, he is made to understand the consequences.  He  is

given  the blood donor's health assessment form where he has  to

sign  a declaration about his blood donation.  If he knows  that

he  is  HIV  infected, he is supposed to refrain  from  donating

blood  and there are legal penalties involved and he knows.   He

is  supposed to read this form, and be counselled before signing

the  form.  But he still does it.  It is very dangerous  because

this could cause the death of the person who receives his blood.

Of  course, if the the blood is infected, we are able to  detect

it  because of our stringent tests.  But in the extreme case, if

it  escapes detection, the consequences would be too heavy.   If

he  does  it wilfully, with his eyes open, then I must  question

what  is  the  motive.   We  must guard ourselves  against  such

irresponsible  behaviour.   I think I  have  addressed  all  the

points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill.  -  [Dr Aline Wong].

<div align="center"><b>(Pulau Pesek Kechil/Ayer Chawan/Sakra)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

Foreshores  Act  (Cap  113)  approves  the  reclamation  by  the

Government  of  the foreshore and seabed, west  of  Pulau  Pesek

Kechil, Pulau Ayer Chawan and Pulau Sakra containing an area  of

about  975.4 ha as shown coloured pink on the plan marked  `LAND

OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO 1/99', which is deposited in the Land

Office, Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliament at its sitting on 28th May 1993 approved Stage

1A  of the reclamation for 166.59 ha of foreshore/seabed between

Pulau  Seraya and Pulau Merlimau, Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau  Ayer

Merbau  and  Pulau  Sakra  to form the proposed  Jurong  Island.

Stages  1B,  1C,  2A,  2B  and  2C  to  reclaim  440.4   ha   of

foreshore/seabed between Pulau Seraya, Pulau Ayer Merbau,  Pulau

Ayer  Chawan,  Pulau Sakra, Pulau Pesek and Pulau  Pesek  Kechil

were  approved  by  Parliament at its sitting on  27th  February

1996.   Stage 3A to reclaim 34 ha of foreshore/seabed  north  of

Pulau Merlimau was approved by Parliament at its sitting of 19th

November 1997.  Stage 2B4 to reclaim 7.59 ha of foreshore/seabed

south of Pulau Ayer Chawan was approved by the Minister for  Law

on  26th October 1998 as it is less than 8 ha.  Majority of  the

reclamation  works  for  these stages have  been  completed  and

proclaimed as State land in 1998, except for Stages 1B,  2C  and

3A which are scheduled for completion in April 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation to form the Jurong Island is to meet the

projected demand for industrial land in Singapore.  It will turn

the  amalgamated Jurong Island into a world-class  chemical  and

petrochemical  complex, with related supporting industries.   It

is  now  proposed  to  proceed with Stage  3B  of  the  proposed

reclamation to reclaim the foreshore/seabed west of Pulau  Pesek

Kechil, Pulau Ayer Chawan and Pulau Sakra as shown coloured pink

on  the  plan marked `LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO  1/99',  a

copy  of  which is displayed in the library of this House.   The

proposed reclamation will yield an additional 975.4 ha  of  land

for industrial development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fills required for the proposed reclamation will be

imported.   The  Jurong Town Corporation will  be  appointed  as

agent  of the Government to oversee the reclamation works.   The

reclamation works, estimated to cost approximately $1.3 billion,

will  commence immediately and is scheduled to be  completed  in

December 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

Foreshores  Act  (Cap  113)  approves  the  reclamation  by  the

Government  of  the foreshore and seabed, west  of  Pulau  Pesek

Kechil, Pulau Ayer Chawan and Pulau Sakra containing an area  of

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL LIST</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, I

beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List

and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule to that

Act   be   varied   by   deleting  the   figures   "$1,779,000",

"$2,404,700", "$841,300" and "$17,000" in the second column  and

substituting the figures "$1,568,000", "$2,137,900",  "$952,500"

and "$241,200" respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed that a provision of $1,672,,400 be supported

for  Class I expenditure.  This is $211,000 less than  the  FY98

provision  because the President has decided to apply  the  wage

cut on the Privy Purse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Class II expenditure (Salaries for

Personal  Staff)  is  expected to decrease  from  $2,404,700  to

$2,137,900 mainly due to the wage cut implemented for the  Civil

Service in January 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision for $952,500 is required for Class III expenditure

(Expenses  of  Household).   This  represents  an  increase   of

$111,200  or 13.2% over the FY98 provision as higher maintenance

expenditure   on  Istana  grounds  and  utilities  charges   are

expected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Class IV expenditure (Special Services), a budget of

$241,200 is allocated which includes a provision of $235,000 for

the replacement of the President's official car.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to vary the provisions in

<div align="center"><b>I   REVIEW OF THE ECONOMY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN 1998</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to 1997 when we were relatively unscathed, the

Singapore  economy experienced the full impact of  the  regional

crisis  in  1998.  Economic growth last year slowed  sharply  to

1.5%.   On  a year-on-year basis, GDP growth has turned negative

for  the  last two quarters of 1998, after registering  negative

quarter-on-quarter growth for the first three quarters of 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp contraction in regional demand was the key cause

of  our  economic weakness.  The crisis-afflicted  economies  of

Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Korea and Hong Kong all  suffered

recessions  in 1998, with significant output declines throughout

the  year.   The  economic  situation  in  Japan  also  worsened

considerably, with rising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>

concerns about its banking system.  Through our close

economic linkages, problems in these six Asian economies

impacted on Singapore, particularly for the more regional-oriented services sectors.  For example, overall trade shrank by

7.5%  in 1998, visitor arrivals declined by 13%, while

activities in the Asian Dollar Market contracted by 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchments reached an all-time high of 28,300 as rising

competitive  pressures, coupled with the  fall-off  in  business

demand,  led  to  consolidations in  business  operations.   Job

insecurity  and  lower  wage growth caused  a  0.1%  decline  in

private  consumption spending.  As demand declined, prices  fell

and  the  Consumer Price Index contracted by 0.3% for  1998.   A

significant  fall in domestic asset prices added to the  bearish

sentiment  and  exacerbated contractionary pressures  associated

with the economic decline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of external and domestic contraction has

produced    Singapore's   second   economic   recession    since

independence.   Unlike the 1985 recession, the current  downturn

is  primarily  a  result  of the sharp  moderation  in  external

demand.  In several regional countries, structural economic  and

financial  problems  have been complicated by  more  fundamental

political and social factors.  These will take a longer time  to

resolve.



<div align="center"><b>OUTLOOK FOR 1999</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the bleak picture in 1998, some positive

signs have emerged over the last three months that the crisis is

stabilising.  The quick succession of US federal rate  cuts  and

the  co-ordinated interest rate reduction initiated by  European

central  banks  toward the close of last year  helped  to  allay

concerns  of  a  global credit crunch and set the  stage  for  a

rapid,  albeit fragile, recovery of financial markets  in  early

1999.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial indicators have also stabilised in the

region.  Interest rates have dropped sharply, improving

liquidity and reducing debt-servicing expenses.  Confidence has

been further boosted, particularly in Korea and Thailand, by

credible progress on policy reforms, sizeable trade surpluses

and strengthening foreign reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, some economic indicators are starting to

improve.   The  Composite  Leading  Index  (CLI),  which   leads

economic activity by about nine months, increased marginally  in

the  third quarter of 1998 and picked up momentum in the  fourth

quarter, after three consecutive quarters of decline.  Increased

new   orders,   lower  manufacturing  unit  labour   costs   and

improvements in business expectations helped fuel the turnaround

in the CLI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also nascent signs of a recovery in the global

electronics industry.  Demand for disk drives and semiconductors

is  on  the  upturn,  following  the  corrections  in  inventory

overhang  and  healthy  new orders  from  the  US.   The  global

semiconductor industry is forecast to grow by 15% in 1999, after

contracting  by  6%  last  year  (Source:  Dataquest.).   Global

shipments  of  disk  drives are expected to rise  by  18%,  with

revenues growing by 7% (Source: TrendFocus).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these positive signs, 1999 may well turn out to be

another difficult and challenging year for Singapore.  We are in

a  period of sharp discontinuities.  Many uncertainties  in  the

external  environment  can still unravel, including  significant

economic,  social  and  political  risks.   Their  outcome  will

substantially affect our prospects this year.

<br><br><b>Global Financial Market Volatility</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial markets, especially in the emerging countries,

are  still  fragile  and prone to bouts of  nervousness,  as  is

evident from the recent episode of the Brazilian Real flotation.

More importantly, the process of de-leveraging and portfolio re-balancing in response to heightened

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>

volatility and risk aversion in emerging markets is

not yet complete.  This will restrict the region's much needed

access to international capital.

<br><br><b>Health of the US Economy</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Japan stagnating and EU adjusting to its new monetary

union, the US remains the linchpin of the global economy.   Some

analysts  have remarked that "what happens in the US is make-or-break  for  the  world  economy this year".   (Financial  Times,

"Cracks  in Wall Street", 7 January 1999, Samuel Brittan.)   The

current  US  expansion has entered its 92nd  month, the  longest

peacetime  expansion  since  the 1850s.   Rapid  above-potential

growth, however, has led to some macroeconomic imbalances in the

US  economy.   The  savings rate has turned  negative.   Current

account deficits are at a record high.  The US economy is widely

expected to moderate to slower growth this year.  This is viewed

as a welcome breather for the overheated economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, several downside risks to this

projection  for a soft landing in the US economy.   For  one,  a

sharp  correction in the US stock market may push the US economy

into  a  sharp  contraction rather than  a  benign  easing.   An

estimated 40% of the average US household's net worth is in  the

stock  market.   The negative wealth effect from  a  substantial

correction  on Wall Street is potentially large.  The  OECD  has

estimated  that a 20% fall in US equities could  lead  to  a  1%

reduction  in  US  GDP as a result of lower  consumer  spending.

(December  1998  OECD Working Paper, "Stock Market  Fluctuations

and  Consumption Behaviour: Some Recent Evidence".)   This  does

not account for the impact on investments or the secondary knock-on  effects, particularly on global financial markets, which are

likely to be substantial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the equity risk, there could also be significant

repercussions  on  the US banking sector and economy  if  Brazil

falls into full-blown recession and drags down the rest of Latin

America.  The US extended 51% of its total overseas lending  and

directed  21%  of its exports to Latin American  countries.   In

terms of corporate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>

exposure, 20% of US' earnings from direct investments

abroad were derived from Latin America.  The linkages are

significant and pose a potential threat to the health of the US

economy.

<br><br><b>Economic Recovery in Japan</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan accounts for 64% of Asia's output and absorbs about

12%   of  Asia's  exports.   It  is  a  key  source  of  capital

investments  and  loan financing for Asia.   After  last  year's

package  of counter-cyclical policy measures, the Japan Economic

Planning   Agency  (EPA)  has  estimated  that  with  sufficient

stimulus,  real  GDP  growth of 0.5% in  FY1999-2000  should  be

achievable.  The Diet has passed a stimulatory budget  worth  82

trillion  yen  for  the  coming fiscal year.   If  the  Japanese

economy  recovers  as  expected  by  the  EPA,  it  can  be  the

locomotive to pull Asia out of its slump.  However, the  chances

are  that  economic  stagnation will  continue  for  some  time.

Competitive pressures may undercut export earnings.  Rising bond

yields  have  raised  long-term  borrowing  costs,  while  over-capacity  in the manufacturing sector is dragging down  profits.

Consumer  and business sentiments are bearish, weighed  down  by

bankruptcies  and  high levels of unemployment.   These  factors

make prospects for a near term recovery very uncertain.

<br><br><b>Socio-Political Developments in the Region</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success and pace of economic reforms, restructuring and

recovery  in  the  region  hinges on restoring  and  maintaining

social  and  political  stability  in  the  affected  countries.

Popular support and social order are pre-requisites to carry out

tough   reforms,   implement  rational  policies   and   restore

confidence.  This is a challenge which all the crisis-hit  Asian

economies are grappling with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest uncertainty is Indonesia, where social and

political tensions threaten to undermine financial and  economic

reforms.  The coming June

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>

elections will be a milestone in determining how the

fragile political and social conditions develop.  If the

elections proceed smoothly, the newly elected government can

ride on its popular mandate to rebuild the economy.  However,

there are considerable stress points ahead.  In particular, the

possibility of civil unrest derailing the reform and recovery

process is worrisome.  An unsettled Indonesia will colour the

entire ASEAN region, including Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst this backdrop of uncertainties, the Ministry of Trade and

Industry has maintained a 1999 GDP forecast of between  -1%  and

+1%  for  Singapore.   If  the global and  regional  environment

remains benign and none of the major risks I have outlined above

materialise,  and  in  particular the situation  in  the  region

stabilises  and  begins to turn around, then it  is  conceivable

that  our GDP growth may exceed +1% in 1999.  On the other hand,

if   some   of  the  critical  uncertainties  in  the   external

environment  do unravel, then Singapore will face a more  dismal

economic  backdrop and GDP may contract by  more  than  1%.   On

balance,  we feel that -1% to +1% is an appropriate forecast  in

an uncertain situation.



<div align="center"><b>MANAGING THE CRISIS</b></div>



Since  the  regional crisis erupted in July 1997, the Government

has   monitored  its  development  closely  and  calibrated  our

response   carefully.   At  the  last  Budget,  we   made   some

adjustments  to  keep our business environment competitive,  but

emphasised a conservative fiscal stance as it was too  early  to

determine  the  full  impact  of  the  crisis.   In  June  1998,

Government implemented a $2 billion off-Budget package of  cost-cuts  and  spending measures.  These were not  intended  as  the

final  package.  Regional developments at that juncture remained

volatile and we needed to assess how events would develop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we deliberated over policy options during this

period, we identified

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>

the critical issues: to maintain the framework for

continued economic activity; help companies tide over the crisis

and minimise unemployment; and enhance our capabilities and

competitiveness for future growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these strategic intentions in mind, the Committee on

Singapore's  Competitiveness (CSC) has recommended comprehensive

measures  to help Singapore regain its competitiveness,  weather

the  crisis and emerge stronger.  Besides keeping Singapore cost

competitive  and  maintaining  economic  activity,  we  have  to

compete  more  effectively by growing the revenue  side  of  the

business equation.

<br><br><b>Cut Business Costs</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is vital to cut business costs to stay

competitive in a period of reduced overall business demand.  The

Government  implemented  a  comprehensive  $10.5  billion   cost

reduction  package in November last year, covering all  the  key

elements  of business cost, including wages, rentals,  utilities

and  transportation  costs.  This was in  response  to  the  CSC

proposals  to help companies survive the crisis and to  preserve

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This major package will take time to show results. Many of

the  cost cutting measures only came into effect on 1st  January

1999.   It is still too early to assess their beneficial  impact

on  businesses  and the economy.  Hence, this  Budget  will  not

contain  any  additional  major  new  cost-cutting  initiatives,

although it will not neglect appropriate rebates to individuals,

which had not been included in the November package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost reduction package has received the wholehearted

support   of  Singaporeans.   Workers  have  accepted  the   15%

reduction in overall wages.  The spirit of tripartism is  strong

and resilient in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always emphasised policies to reduce stickiness in

wages and improve the flexibility in the labour market.  We have

progressively  built up a flexi-wage component over  the  years,

and avoided

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>

restrictive mechanisms such as  minimum  wages,  wage

mark-ups or job security legislation.  This has given us  unique

flexibility to adjust our wages quickly in the current downturn,

to  preserve  our  competitiveness.  This has not  only  reduced

business  costs  but also helped arrest the fall-off  in  labour

demand.  Without the necessary wage adjustments, even more  jobs

would  have been lost and the unemployment rate would have risen

to more than the 3.2% actually registered in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cost-cutting package has been well received by both

analysts and investors.  A recent Merrill Lynch report commented

that  as  a  result of the cost-cutting measures,  "unit  labour

costs  should  plunge  back to the 1992-93 level,  substantially

boosting the economy's cost competitiveness".  Another report by

ABN-AMRO  noted that "Singapore is demonstrating that  with  the

package  it can adjust its prices and costs quickly. The package

will  help boost confidence in the economy".  Investors too have

reacted  positively.  The substantial cost savings, particularly

from  the  CPF cut, will help businesses ride out this difficult

period.   The  package has also helped the Economic  Development

Board  (EDB)  convince investors that Singapore offers  them  an

attractive  business  proposition, even  in  the  midst  of  the

recession.

<br><br><b>Ensure Access to Working Capital</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is necessary to improve access to working

capital.   Government  has  significantly  enhanced  the   Local

Enterprise  Finance  Scheme (LEFS).  This includes  raising  the

overall  credit  line  available, increasing  the  maximum  loan

quantum  per  company and widening the scope of  the  scheme  to

cover  more  local  enterprises.   In  addition,  EDB  and   the

Productivity  and  Standards Board (PSB)  have  been  active  in

helping  participating financial institutions  obtain  a  better

understanding of the loan applicant's business case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback indicates that these changes to LEFS have met the needs

of local companies.  Between April and December

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>

1998,  more  than $470 million  of  LEFS  loans  were

approved  to local enterprises.  In particular, short-term  LEFS

loans increased by up to 600% during this period, reflecting the

short-term cash needs of local companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the equity base of promising local

enterprises (PLEs) and help them enhance their capabilities  and

growth, EDB will step up the pace of its co-investment in  PLEs.

It  will take up short-term equity stakes of up to 30% in  these

companies.   After  an appropriate period, EDB  will  exit  from

these  investments, for example, by selling its shares  back  to

the  PLEs.   This enhanced co-investment programme will  support

companies in both the manufacturing and hub services sectors.

<br><br><b>Market Diversification</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we need to diversify our export markets. Singapore

needs to develop strong trade and business linkages to all parts

of  the  global  economy.   This  will  make  our  economy  more

resilient,  and  help  to  offset  cyclical  slowdowns  in   any

particular region or industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board (TDB) will be adopting a three-pronged approach to ensure that Singapore maintains its

competitive edge in the global trading arena.  This will involve

accessing  emerging markets, expanding demand  into  traditional

markets  such  as the US and EU, and consolidating resources  in

regional markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen market access, TDB has expanded the scope of

its  Trade Development Incentive (TDI) to help companies promote

trade   and  participate  in  specialised  programmes  such   as

international franchising and brand marketing.  Since FY96,  TDB

has  approved some 250 cases amounting to $11 million under  the

TDI.  Government has allocated an additional $20 million to  TDI

over the next two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TDB will also be stepping up its market development efforts

to increase companies' awareness of opportunities

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>

further  afield.   In  1998,  around  800  companies

participated   in  TDB's  business  missions  and  international

exhibitions.  This year, TDB will be organising some  100  trade

missions and international fairs. About 30 such events  will  be

targeted at the traditional growth markets, such as  the US  and

EU.   Another 40 events will be targeted at emerging markets  in

East Europe, South Asia, Middle East, Latin America and Africa.

<br><br><b>Investment Promotion</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we need to step up investment promotion to sustain

and  upgrade  the  flow  of  investments  into  knowledge-driven

activities and create challenging jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spur more investments in manufacturing and services,

Government   has   re-introduced  the   Liberalised   Investment

Allowance  Scheme  (LIAS).  This provides a 30% across-the-board

investment  allowance  for expenditure on productive  equipment.

In   addition,  Government  has  also  allowed  for  a   higher,

discretionary  allowance of 50%, for approved  investments  that

meet certain requirements, such as higher contribution to value-added.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, EDB will intensify its investment promotion

efforts, including stationing more officers overseas in the  US,

Japan and Europe, in order to achieve its target of $7.5 billion

in  manufacturing investments and $1.5 billion in total business

spending this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the vision set out by the CSC for Singapore to

develop  into a globally competitive knowledge economy, EDB  has

also  recently unveiled its Industry 21 (I21) Plan.  The  vision

of  I21  is for Singapore to be a vibrant and robust global  hub

for  knowledge-driven industries.  EDB will develop  Singapore's

manufacturing  and  exportable services sectors  with  a  strong

emphasis on technology,

innovation  and  capabilities.   Reflecting  this  shift,   jobs

created will have a higher proportion of skilled workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><b>Capabilities Building</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, capabilities building. We will use the crisis

period  to  upgrade both our physical infrastructure  and  human

capital, so that we can compete in the global economic arena  on

the  basis of world-class capabilities, while managing our  cost

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and economic infrastructure will continue to

remain   a  priority  in  Government's  development  expenditure

programme  this  year.   To build economic infrastructure,  $1.9

billion worth of new development projects were approved  in  the

off-Budget measures in June 1998.  These included major projects

such  as  the  incorporation of IT into  primary  and  secondary

schools,   upgrading  of  university  facilities   and   further

investment in Singapore ONE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY99, Government will continue to invest in economic

capabilities  for  the long term.  We will increase  development

spending  by a substantial $1.2 billion to $13.9 billion.   This

is  the highest development budget to date.  We will continue to

invest  more in education, up from $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion,

to provide better schools, campus infrastructure and facilities,

teaching  equipment and to roll out the IT Master  Plan.   These

education  projects  will prepare our next  generation  for  the

challenge of a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also spend more to increase our industrial land

stock with on-going reclamation at Jurong Island, Tuas View  and

Changi  East.   Likewise,  we  will increase  spending  on  rail

infrastructure, including the North-East MRT line and the Changi

MRT extension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key challenge is upgrading our manpower to keep

workers   employable.    With  the  rapid   pace   of   economic

restructuring, the current unemployment can turn into structural

unemployment over time, as unemployed persons may be  mismatched

with  new  job vacancies because they do not possess  the  right

skills.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pressing issue. A disproportionate

share  of  retrenched local workers in 1998 were older  than  40

years  of  age  and  with  less than secondary  education.   The

duration of unemployment has also increased to 8.9 weeks in mid-1998,  compared  with  7.5 weeks a year earlier.   As  long-term

unemployed  workers lose their job skills and become stigmatised

by  employers,  this  could  lead to increasing  and  persistent

unemployment  rates, a phenomenon seen in European  unemployment

for the last 15 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must press on with Continuous Education and Training

(CET)  and skills upgrading to tackle this problem of structural

unemployment.  While the threat is more immediate for older  and

lower-skilled  workers, it is no less urgent for our  executives

and   professionals.   They  too  must  hone  their  skills  and

expertise  in  order to develop new capabilities and  anticipate

the rapidly changing demands in the workplace.  As such, our CET

plans  encompass  the entire spectrum of the  workforce  -  from

young  to  old,  and from semi-skilled workers to  managers  and

professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific Government initiatives launched under the CET

umbrella  include  the  following: an  initial  budget  of  $120

million  pledged  for the expansion of the Skills  Redevelopment

Programme  which pays special attention to unskilled  and  semi-skilled mid-career workers; and $800 million for the Initiatives

in  New  Technology (INTECH) grant scheme targeted  at  manpower

development  in leading edge technologies, of which $50  million

has  been  earmarked  for  EDB's  new  Training  and  Attachment

Programme  (TAP)  which  helps fund the  cost  of  training  new

engineering  graduates  recruited  by  MNCs  at  their  overseas

plants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is working out

a broad funding mechanism to support the development of national

manpower capabilities as part of the Manpower 21 (M21) exercise.

The  M21 Report will be announced in due course.  Programmes  in

the pipeline

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>

include setting up a Skills Certification  System  to

establish  a  skills  progression path  and  skills  acquisition

benchmark  for the workforce; the Strategic Manpower  Conversion

Programme   to  incentivise  the  deployment  of  under-utilised

professional  manpower  into  strategic  sectors   with   skills

shortages;  and  supporting learning  providers  to  create  and

augment the infrastructure and curriculum for lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to build up a national framework for continuous

enhancement  of  knowledge and skills. The goal is  to  educate,

train  and retrain workers so that they can continue to take  on

new  jobs  or  enlarged duties. This is the essence of  lifelong

employability.



<div align="center"><b>CONCLUSION</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 is likely to be another difficult year. Despite signs

of  improvement in the external environment, the outlook remains

uncertain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has set out the key thrusts to help Singapore

overcome the crisis and prepare for competition beyond.  We must

work  together  to  implement them vigorously,  but  retain  the

flexibility  to  adjust our tactics if the external  environment

changes  again.  The benefits of the cost cuts will flow through

to  the Singapore economy and businesses this year.  The key now

is to grow our business revenues by expanding our export markets

and  sustaining investments.  To underpin these key thrusts,  we

need  to  build up our economic capabilities, both in  terms  of

infrastructure and manpower skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, the workers, management and Government

must  all  work together.  Then, we will weather this  difficult

period, and realise our vision for Singapore as an advanced  and

globally competitive knowledge economy.



<div align="center"><b>II   THE FY99 BUDGET</b></div>



Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I move on now to the Budget for  Fiscal  Year

1999.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>EXPENDITURE POLICY</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Budget Debate last year, the Government has

responded  to the regional crisis with two packages of  stimulus

measures  to stabilise the Singapore economy.  In June  1998,  I

announced  a  $2  billion off-budget package  which  carried  an

impact  of  $1.6 billion on our FY98 budget.  In November  1998,

just  three months ago, DPM Lee presented to this House a  $10.5

billion   cost-cutting  package.   This  was  in   response   to

recommendations of the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.

The package has an impact on the FY99 budget of $1.8 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not wait until the FY99 Budget to implement these

measures  because  timely  response to  the  unfolding  regional

crisis  is  critical.   Our approach is to monitor  developments

closely   and   respond   with   measures   to   maintain    the

competitiveness   of  the  economy  relative   to   our   export

competitors.   The  measures announced were  designed  to  lower

overall business costs.  The aim is to help businesses tide over

this  difficult  period and to keep as many people  employed  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we grapple with the immediate problems of the

economic  slowdown,  we  must not  lose  sight  of  longer  term

challenges.  After the region recovers, our competitors in  Asia

will  emerge stronger and fitter if they undertake the  economic

reforms  and  restructuring needed  to  pull  them  out  of  the

economic  crisis.   We must therefore resist the  temptation  to

overdraw  on  our reserves to offset unavoidable wage  cuts,  or

allow  ourselves  to succumb to the lure of welfarism  which  we

cannot reverse later on.  Instead, we should be taking steps  to

enhance our capability for long-term competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on to present details of the FY99 expenditure

programme, allow me to recapitulate briefly the basic tenets of

our expenditure policy.  Our aim is to foster the growth of the

private sector by keeping the public sector lean and trim,

whilst maintaining a high quality of public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>

service.  We will live within our means by ensuring that budgets

are balanced over the long term.  Expenditure will be focused on

fostering  future growth by investing heavily on developing  our

human  resources,  in economic infrastructure  and  other  areas

which yield lasting returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the salient features of this year's

expenditure budget.

<div align="center"><b>FY99 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 20.5% of GDP, total expenditure in FY99 is estimated at

$29.2 billion.  This is an increase of 5.6% or $1.5 billion over

FY98.   The  increase  is mainly due to a  rise  in  development

expenditure, which I will elaborate later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in previous years, the largest allocations go to defence

and  education  at  25%  and  19% of total  Government  spending

respectively.  As security provides the basis for  our  nation's

economic growth and prosperity, it is important that we maintain

a  strong  defence capability.  Defence spending will  therefore

continue at the FY98 level of $7.3 billion, accounting for  5.1%

of GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the future of Singapore will depend on the quality of

our  human  resources,  we  will  continue  to  invest  more  in

education.   For  FY99,  we  have  budgeted  $5.7  billion   for

expenditure  on  education.   Education's  share  of   GDP   has

increased  steadily from 3.0% in FY97, to 3.4% in  FY98  and  to

just  under  4.0%  of  GDP  in  FY99.   Our  medium-term  target

allocation for education is 4.0% of GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending by the Ministry of Manpower to promote manpower

development has almost tripled from $58 million in FY97 to  $170

million  in  FY98, and is allocated $150 million  in  FY99.   In

order  to sustain growth against rising competition, our economy

will  have  to constantly restructure towards higher value-added

economic  activities.   The  importance  of  upgrading  and  re-training  our workers to ensure employability in an increasingly

knowledge- based economy cannot be over emphasised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the social and community services sector

is  allocated the largest share of 39% of the budget, increasing

its  share over FY98, on account of higher spending on education

and  public  housing.   In  the same order  as  last  year,  the

security  sector  is  next with 32% of  the  total  budget,  and

economic and infrastructure development comes in third with 19%.

<br><br><b>Operating expenditure</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure is budgeted at $15.2 billion, a small

increase of $300 million or 2% compared to FY98.  Half  of  this

increase  is on account of a re-distribution of defence spending

from  development to operating expenditure.  The other  half  of

the  increase is due to a central provision of $125 million kept

by  MOF  to  provide for new Government programmes  which  might

arise in the course of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the policy of wage restraint in the civil service,

manpower cost will remain at $3 billion, despite providing for a

net  increase of 4,400 posts.  The main increases are some 5,000

teaching  posts  and  400  posts  for  immigration  and   prison

officers.  This is partially offset by the deletion of some  900

posts in PWD, with its corporatisation from 1st April 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While running costs on the whole will rise by some $350

million  to  $14.0 billion, transfers will dip slightly  by  $50

million   to  $1.2  billion  due  largely  to  an  extraordinary

contribution  of  $79 million in FY98 to NTUC and  ITE  for  the

Skills  Redevelopment Programme.  Still, the level of  transfers

remained  some 18% higher when compared to FY97.   Subsidies  to

restructured hospitals take up about half of transfers, while  a

sum  of  $170  million is allocated to public housing  subsidies

such  as subventions to town councils.  Another $120 million  is

allocated to MCD for disbursement to community self-help groups,

voluntary  welfare  organisations and  needy  individuals  under

various financial assistance schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a share of GDP, operating expenditure will rise to

10.7%, up from 10.4% in FY98 and 9.7% in FY97.  This is largely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>

the  result  of  slowing  GDP  growth,  as  operating

expenditure has not risen substantially in absolute terms and is

practically held at a standstill compared to FY98.  It has  been

our  policy to constrain operating expenditure to grow in tandem

with,  and  no faster than GDP growth, in order to  keep  public

sector  expansion in check.  However, during periods of economic

slowdown,  we  can accept a rise in the operating  expenditure's

share  of  GDP  so  as to avoid a degradation  of  basic  public

services  and  to  support  additional  expenditure  for   early

recruitment of teachers and other staff.

<br><br><b>Development expenditure</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total development spending will amount to $13.9 billion, an

increase  of $1.2 billion from $12.7 billion in FY98.   However,

compared  to  FY97, the FY99 development budget is  a  hefty  $5

billion  or  50% more.  In fact, Government has been  increasing

development   spending  over  the  last  5  years.   Development

spending has grown on average by about 30% each year since FY94.

The  FY99  development  budget is about 3.5  times  higher  than

development  spending 5 years ago in FY94, when it  amounted  to

only $4.0 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that the large sums allocated to

development  spending is not to pump-prime the  economy  because

this  would have limited effect as we are a small open  economy.

Instead, our aim is to invest in strategic development projects,

especially  those  with  long gestation periods,  such  as  land

reclamation  and  IT in education.  These are investments  which

would reap benefits several years down the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, every sector of development spending

has  grown compared to FY97.   The largest increase is  spending

on  the  social and community services sector, which has doubled

from  $3.1  billion  in  FY97  to  $6.0  billion  in  FY99.   In

percentage  terms, the social and community services  sector  is

allocated  the  largest share of 43% of the development  budget.

The   other   major   allocation  goes  to  the   economic   and

infrastructure development sector at 34%.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on education increased from $1.0 billion

in  FY97  to $1.7 billion in FY98, and to $2.2 billion in  FY99.

This is a 31% increase over FY98.  Of this, more than $1 billion

goes  towards development of schools and campuses,  and  another

$350  million  on IT Masterplan and IT projects in  schools  and

tertiary institutions.  A provision of $170 million is set aside

to  build  residential  and  hostel facilities  in  schools  and

campuses,  and  $250 million for new projects comprising  mostly

buildings and further IT investment in tertiary institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on public housing increased from $850 million in

FY97  to  $1.9  billion in FY98, and to $2.3  billion  in  FY99.

Deficit  financing to HDB accounts for $1.2 billion, mainly  due

to  a  surge  in  demand  under the CPF  Housing  Grant  Scheme.

Continuing   HDB  upgrading  is  allocated  $430   million   and

compensation under the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme is

allocated  $370  million.  The $400 million increase  in  public

housing  spending is mainly due to increased provisions of  $150

million   for   compensation   under   the   Selective   En-bloc

Redevelopment Scheme and $270 million for deficit  financing  to

HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on environment has also risen steadily from $650

million in FY97 to $1.0 billion in FY98, and is set to level off

at  $980 million in FY99.  The Fourth Refuse Incineration  Plant

at Tuas accounts for half of this sum, while the other half goes

to   improvements  and  expansion  of  sewerage   and   drainage

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic and infrastructure development sector no

longer  occupies first place in development spending because  of

the  large  increase in allocation to the social  and  community

services sector.  Nevertheless, the sector is still allocated  a

sizeable  sum of $4.7 billion.  This is lower than  spending  in

FY98 by $220 million, but 23% higher than the $3.8 billion spent

in   FY97.     The   sector  is  led  by  strong   spending   on

communications and trade and industry projects at  $1.8  billion

and $1.7 billion respectively.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North-East MRT Line and the Changi MRT extension

projects  account for two-thirds of the $1.8 billion development

budget  for  communications.  In all, rail projects account  for

$1.4   billion,  while  another  $270  million  goes   to   road

improvements and development of bus interchanges.  Provision  is

also made for continuing reclamation at Changi East.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on trade and industry projects has slipped by $350

million  compared  to FY98.  However, this does  not  reflect  a

lower  commitment by Government, but rather the result  of  huge

savings  in lower tender prices for recent reclamation  projects

awarded  for Jurong Island Phase III and reclamation  at  Changi

East.   More  than half of MTI's development budget will  go  to

reclamation at Jurong Island, Tuas View, Changi East and Sentosa

Cove.  Spending on these reclamation projects will increase from

$810  million  last year to $930 million in FY99.   Other  major

projects  in  this  year's budget are the  Economic  Development

Assistance  Scheme, the Tourism 21 Plan to re-develop  Chinatown

attractions,  the Mega Exhibition Centre and the  Singapore  ONE

project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on the general services and security sectors

accounts   for  the  remaining  allocation  at   12%   and   11%

respectively  of  the development budget.   The  allocation  for

general services will see an increase of $730 million from FY98.

This  is  largely  accounted for by  $500  million  to  be  held

centrally  by MOF for new projects, which Ministries may  embark

on  in the course of the year, and $260 million more for the New

Supreme Court building project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on internal security is expected to remain at the

same  level  as the last two years.  Provision is made  for  on-going projects such as the Civil Defence Shelters Programme, and

new   complexes  for  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,   Police

Headquarters,  Singapore Civil Defence  Force  Headquarters  and

Traffic  Police Headquarters.  Provisions are also made for  the

redevelopment  of the Changi Prison Complex and Command  Control

and Communication Systems to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>

improve  the operational capability  of  the  Police,

Singapore Civil Defence Force and Central Narcotics Bureau.

<div align="center"><b>III   REVENUE AND TAX CHANGES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now

turn to the fiscal position and the proposed tax changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue collection is projected to fall from $27.2 billion

in  FY98  to  $24.1  billion in FY99, a $3.1  billion  or  11.4%

decline.   As  a  percentage  of GDP,  revenue  collection  will

decline  from 18.9% in FY98 to 16.9% in FY99.  As operating  and

development  expenditures in FY99 are budgeted at $29.2  billion

or 20.5% of GDP, an operating deficit of $5.1 billion or 3.5% of

GDP is projected for FY99.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall in operating revenue is attributable to slower

economic growth expected in FY99 and the revenue impact  of  the

various  off-budget  measures announced  by  the  Government  to

stimulate  the economy.  In particular, the $10.5 billion  cost-cutting  package  announced  in November  last  year  to  reduce

business cost will have a negative impact of about $1.8  billion

on the FY99 budget balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget deficit will be funded entirely from surpluses

accumulated by the Government in its current term of office.  As

I  have  noted earlier, our fiscal policy is to live within  our

means   and   aim  for  a  balanced  budget  in  normal   years,

accumulating  surpluses in good years of strong economic  growth

and drawing against reserves in years of economic downturn.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should now allow the effects of the packages

of stimulus and cost-cutting

measures already announced to work through the system before  we

decide whether further measures are necessary.  But even  as  we

adopt short-term measures to deal with current difficulties,  we

have  to keep our eyes on the future, develop the infrastructure

necessary  for  our future growth, enhance our capabilities  and

put   in   place  a  conducive  framework  for  businesses   and

individuals in Singapore to thrive.  Only then will we  be  well

placed when the region recovers from the economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore be introducing changes to some tax

incentives  to  promote the development of certain  high  value-added  sectors of our economy.  At the same time, Government  is

mindful  of the difficulties faced by individuals and households

in  the  current  economic downturn.  The  cost-cutting  package

announced  in  November  1998  was focused  mainly  on  reducing

business costs.  I will therefore be announcing several measures

to help individuals later in my speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with tax changes for companies.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES</b></div>

<br><br><b>Corporate Tax Rebate</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced in November last year, the Government will

give  a  10% rebate on corporate income tax, excluding Singapore

dividends, for the Year of Assessment 1999.

<br><br><b>Tax Incentives to Promote the Bond Market</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the FY98 Budget, I announced several tax incentives to

promote the development of an active bond market. The incentives

included  tax  exemption  on  interest  income  earned  by  non-residents  from  qualifying debt securities and  on  fee  income

derived by financial institutions from arranging debt securities

in  Singapore.  I am now pleased to announce further refinements

to these bond market tax incentives.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, tax exemption on interest from

qualifying debt securities paid to non-residents only applies if

the  non-residents  do  not  have  permanent  establishments  in

Singapore.   To  facilitate a wider distribution  of  qualifying

debt  securities, I have decided to extend the tax exemption  to

include  non-residents  who  have  permanent  establishments  in

Singapore, provided that such non-residents do not purchase  the

securities using funds from their Singapore operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifying debt securities are currently defined as debt

securities   which  are  substantially  arranged  by   financial

institutions  in Singapore.  In some cases, this condition  gave

rise  to uncertainties about the availability of the incentives.

This is because the global character of institutions and markets

makes  it necessary for the arrangers to use staff based outside

Singapore,  or employed by affiliated companies, to successfully

execute  the  transaction.  To rectify this  situation,  I  have

decided  to create an "Approved Bond Intermediary" (ABI)  scheme

to  complement the existing regime.  Under the ABI  scheme,  the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS) will evaluate a financial

institution's  debt  origination  and  trading  capabilities  in

Singapore on an overall basis.  Once a financial institution has

been awarded ABI status, all debt securities lead managed by  it

would  be treated as "qualifying debt securities".  There  would

be  no  need  for  an  ABI  to  satisfy,  on  a  transaction-by-transaction  basis, the current test of "substantial arrangement

in  Singapore".  This will enable ABIs to provide their  clients

with  greater certainty regarding our tax incentives,  and  will

also   serve   to  emphasize  Singapore's  goal  of  encouraging

financial   institutions   to   increase   their   debt   market

capabilities here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above refinements will be effective from 27th February

1999  up  to  27th February 2003.  ABI status may be awarded  to

financial  institutions  upon  application  to  MAS.   MAS  will

publish further details in a circular.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><b>Tax  Exemption on Income Earned by Primary Dealers in  Singapore Government Securities (SGS) from Trading in SGS</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government Securities or SGS market is a key

element  in  Singapore's domestic debt  market.   To  develop  a

robust  bond market, it is important to first establish a liquid

SGS  market  to define a benchmark yield curve to which  private

issuers can make reference when pricing their bond issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, income earned by all financial institutions from

trading  in  debt  securities, including  SGS,  is  taxed  at  a

concessionary  tax  rate  of  10%.  Government  recognises  that

Primary  Dealers  play  an essential role  in  SGS  markets,  by

fulfilling the role of market makers and driving the process  of

price  discovery  and  trading  liquidity.   To  encourage  more

financial  institutions  to take on  the  role  of  SGS  Primary

Dealers and to provide a significant incentive commensurate with

the  obligations  undertaken  by SGS  Primary  Dealers,  I  have

decided to exempt from tax income derived by SGS Primary Dealers

from  trading in SGS.  The incentive will be effective from 27th

February 1999, for a period of four years.

<br><br><b>Tax Exemption Scheme for Syndicated Facilities</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tax Exemption Scheme for Syndicated Facilities was

introduced in 1983 to encourage financial institutions  to  base

their  syndication  activities in  Singapore.   The  scheme  has

operated  successfully and there has been a steady  increase  in

syndication  activities  in Singapore  since  its  introduction.

Last  year, I announced that the scheme would be extended for  a

further five years until 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, MAS approves each syndicated facility on a case-by-case basis. To give arrangers upfront certainty on whether a

facility  qualifies  for  tax exemption,  I  am  introducing  an

automated  procedure.  Under the automated procedure, facilities

which meet certain defined criteria will automatically be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>

granted tax exemption, without the need to obtain case-by-case  approval from MAS.  The automated procedure  will  take

effect from 27th February 1999.  MAS will publish the details of

the procedure in a circular.

<br><br><b>Tax Incentive to Promote Boutique Fund Management</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the early nineties, fund management activity has

grown  rapidly.   Compared to 1991, there has been  a  five-fold

increase  in  the amount of funds managed in Singapore  to  $124

billion in 1997.  This is expected to grow further, despite  the

Asian economic crisis.  Many large and internationally reputable

fund  management  companies  have  established  a  presence   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking and Finance Subcommittee of the Committee on

Singapore's  Competitiveness  has,  however,  recommended   that

Singapore  should  also encourage the growth  of  boutique  fund

managers.  Boutique fund managers are primarily indigenous  fund

management  companies  set  up  and  run  by  professionals  who

typically  have  considerable experience in the fund  management

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurturing boutique fund managers will create more diversity

and  also  contribute  towards the  growth  of  our  local  fund

management  industry.  I have therefore decided to  exempt  from

tax,  the  qualifying income derived by foreign  investors  from

funds  managed by qualifying boutique fund managers.  The  types

of  income  qualifying for exemption will be the  same  as  that

under  the  Approved Fund Manager scheme.  The  scheme  will  be

effective for a period of five years from 27th February 1999 and

will  be administered by MAS.  MAS will be releasing the details

separately.

<br><br><b>Tax Deduction for General Provisions Made by Finance Companies</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1997, finance companies have been given tax deduction

for  general  provisions made against their loan and  investment

portfolios.  This is subject to an annual limit of the lower  of

25% of qualifying profits or 0.5% of qualifying loans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>

and investments, as well as an overall limit of 2% of

qualifying loans and investments.  This has encouraged finance

companies to make adequate general provisions to cushion against

unexpected losses in their operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economic environment has, however, been

adversely  affected  by the downturn in the regional  economies.

In view of this, it is prudent for finance companies to build up

their level of general provisions further.  To encourage them to

do  so, the annual limits of 25% of qualifying profits and  0.5%

of   qualifying  loans  and  investments  will  be   temporarily

suspended  for a period of two years with effect  from  Year  of

Assessment  1999.   In  addition, the overall  limit  of  2%  of

qualifying loans and investments will be raised to 3% from  Year

of   Assessment  1999.   These  changes  will  provide   finance

companies  greater flexibility in making general  provisions  to

cushion against potential losses that could arise owing  to  the

poor  economic environment.  This will strengthen the  financial

position  of  finance companies, and the overall  soundness  and

stability of the financial system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for the above concessions, the finance company

must  satisfy  the  existing  statutory  minimum  capital  funds

requirement of $50 million and minimum capital adequacy ratio of

12%, as prescribed under the Finance Companies Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to corporate tax changes for other

sectors of the economy.

<br><br><b>Tax Exemption for Global OHQs</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Operational Headquarters (OHQ) scheme was introduced in

1986  to  promote the services sector as one of the twin engines

of  growth.  Under the OHQ scheme, companies awarded OHQ  status

will  enjoy  a  10%  concessionary tax rate on their  qualifying

income.    At  present, most companies awarded OHQ  status  have

been based in Singapore to service the Asia Pacific region.   To

encourage  companies  to locate and perform  their  headquarters

functions in Singapore to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>

service network companies worldwide, I have decided to

enhance the existing OHQ incentive by granting tax exemption  to

OHQs  which perform at least one substantive global function  in

Singapore.   The incentive will be granted for a maximum  period

of ten years, and will take effect from Year of Assessment 2000.

Companies may apply to EDB for this incentive after Budget Day.

<br><br><b>Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader (ACMT) Scheme</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract manufacturers play a key role in our manufacturing

sector.   Some  of  our  homegrown contract  manufacturers  have

become  global  players.  These companies  usually  contract  to

perform  value-added manufacturing activities  on  semi-finished

goods  consigned to them, and then export the finished goods  to

their overseas clients.  In recent years, contract manufacturing

has  become more complex.  For example, instead of exporting the

finished goods, it is not uncommon for contract manufacturers to

be asked by their overseas clients to deliver the finished goods

to customers in Singapore.  This local delivery is considered  a

taxable  supply under our GST laws.  However, in some instances,

the  overseas clients to whom the finished goods belong  do  not

designate an agent in Singapore to account for the GST on  their

behalf   in  respect  of  the  local  delivery.   The   contract

manufacturers in such a situation would have to bear the GST  on

local delivery and have no recourse to claim it back.  This  GST

burden  could  make our contract manufacturers less  competitive

internationally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our local contract manufacturers remain

competitive,  I have decided to introduce a scheme,  called  the

Approved  Contract  Manufacturer and Trader  (ACMT)  scheme,  to

relieve    contract   manufacturers   whose    businesses    are

substantially with overseas clients, of this GST burden.   Under

this  scheme,  the local delivery of the finished goods  to  the

customers  of  the overseas client and the fees for  the  value-added activities on the goods will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>

deemed to be outside the scope of GST and GST will not

be  chargeable.   Instead, the overseas client's  customers  who

purchase and receive the goods in Singapore will account for GST

by  way  of a "reverse charge".  Besides contract manufacturers,

this scheme will be made available to traders who also engage in

value-adding activities substantially for overseas clients,  and

face the same GST problem as the contract manufacturers on their

local  deliveries.  The scheme will be administered  jointly  by

IRAS,  EDB  and  TDB.   Further details of the  scheme  will  be

released separately by the administering agencies.

<br><br><b>Waiver of GST for Goods Removed from Bonded Warehouse</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of a logistics sector with extensive

networks  is critical to our continued growth as a global  trade

centre and hub port.  To encourage logistics operators to expand

their  business in Singapore and use Singapore  as  a  base  for

their operations, I have decided to waive the GST chargeable  on

goods  removed  by  traders registered with the  Major  Exporter

Scheme  (MES)  from  bonded  warehouses  operated  by  logistics

companies.   With this waiver, MES traders will be able  to  use

their MES status to remove goods from bonded warehouses operated

by logistics companies free of GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST waiver will remove an existing disadvantage faced

by  local  logistics companies, vis-a-vis overseas suppliers  of

the  same goods, as under the current situation, MES traders  by

virtue  of their MES status do not have to pay GST upfront  when

they import the goods directly from overseas suppliers.

<br><br><b>Extension  of Tax Incentive for Exhibition Organisers  to  Cover International Conferences</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staging of international conferences in Singapore

complements  the many international exhibitions and trade  fairs

currently held here.  Together, they play the important role  of

enhancing Singapore as the hub for knowledge and trade  exchange

for the international

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>

business  community.  I  have  therefore  decided  to

extend   the  tax  concession  granted  to  approved  exhibition

organisers  to  companies organising and managing  international

conferences  in  Singapore.   The  approved  companies  will  be

granted  a concessionary tax rate of not less than 10% on  their

incremental  income.   This  will  provide  further  impetus  to

develop   Singapore   into  an  International   Exhibition   and

Conference City.  The extension to the tax concession will  take

effect from Year of Assessment 2000.

<br><br><b>Tax  Exemption for Floating Production Storage Offloading Vessel and Floating Storage Offloading Vessel</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has come a long way in developing as a maritime

centre.   According to United Nations Conference  on  Trade  and

Development  (UNCTAD), we have moved from the 19th  position  in

1991  to become the 13th most important maritime nation.  Today,

a  critical mass of established international shipping companies

exists  in  Singapore,  providing a wide  spectrum  of  shipping

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support Singapore's drive towards higher value-added

activities in the shipping sector, I have decided to extend  the

existing  Approved International Shipping Enterprise  Scheme  to

cover  income derived from the operation of Floating  Production

Storage Offloading vessel and Floating Storage Offloading vessel

(or  FPSO/FSO)  in  Singapore.  These are  primarily  crude  oil

tanker   vessels  which  have  been  specially   converted   for

deployment  in the offshore field for production and storage  of

crude  oil.  The operation of FPSOs and FSOs therefore  requires

the  application of both advanced maritime and technology-driven

expertise.    The  development  of  the  FPSO/FSO  industry   in

Singapore  will not only serve to broaden the scope of  shipping

activities  in  Singapore, it will also  complement  Singapore's

role  as  the  world's  third largest oil refinery  and  trading

centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for the incentive, the company must have

substantial  operations  and  possess  a  team  of  professional

expertise in Singapore.  The incentive will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>

be granted for a period of ten years and will take

effect from Year of Assessment 2000.  TDB will administer this

incentive.

<br><br><b>Extension of One-Year Accelerated Depreciation Allowance  Scheme to Replacement of Diesel-Driven Vehicles</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a growing vehicle population in Singapore, total

emissions  from  vehicles will creep up over  time.   This  will

adversely affect our ambient air quality and may become a health

hazard.   We therefore need to impose strict emission  standards

on new vehicles and at the same time, reduce the number of older

vehicles on the roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diesel-driven commercial goods vehicles

and  buses are allowed to be used on the roads for up to  twenty

years.   Old and inefficient diesel-driven vehicles are a  major

source of pollution as they generate a disproportionately  large

amount of particulates and other pollutants that are harmful  to

health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of replacing an old vehicle with a new one is

high.   As a result, older vehicles are generally not taken  off

the  roads before the end of their statutory lifespan.  One  way

of encouraging owners of older vehicles to do so is to provide a

tax  incentive  to partially defray the high cost  of  replacing

vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided that with effect from 27th

February  1999, the one-year accelerated depreciation  allowance

scheme would be extended to the purchase of new commercial goods

vehicles  and  buses, on the condition that the new  vehicle  is

replacing  an  old  diesel-driven vehicle which  was  registered

before 1st January 1991, and which either has at least one  year

of  valid COE left or is eligible for COE renewal.  Ministry  of

the Environment will administer the scheme.

<div align="center"><b>PERSONAL TAX CHANGES</b></div>

<br><br><b>Personal Tax Rebate</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, the Government gave a 10% across-the-board rebate

on  individual income tax as a reward for individual effort  and

to share the budget surplus.  Last year, despite the worsening

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>

economic conditions, the Government gave a 5%  rebate

on  individual  income  tax to provide a measure  of  relief  to

taxpayers.  Although some signs of stability have emerged, there

still remain critical uncertainties in the external environment.

Nevertheless, I have decided to restore the personal tax  rebate

to  10%  for  the Year of Assessment 1999, similar to  1997,  in

order  to  help  taxpayers  tide over this  temporary  difficult

period.   The  estimated  revenue loss  to  Government  is  $275

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the GST-related changes made to personal income

tax, currently about 65% of individuals no longer pay income tax

and therefore would not benefit from the income tax rebate.   To

extend help to these individuals, the Government will grant  the

same  rebates  on  HDB  rentals and  town  council  Service  and

Conservancy  (S&C)  charges as in 1997 to  citizens  staying  in

rented  and  owner-occupied HDB flats.  The rebates will  be  as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) One-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months' net rent and three months' net S&C charges. The

rental  rebates will be made on 1st June and 1st September,  and

the  S&C rebates will be made on 1st June, 1st September and 1st

December this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Two-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month's net rent and three months' net S&C charges. The

rental rebate will be made on 1st June, and the S&C rebates will

be made on 1st June, 1st September and 1st December this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Three-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months' net S&C charges. The S&C rebates will be made on

1st June, 1st September and 1st December this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Four-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month's net S&C charges. The S&C rebate will be made on 1st

June this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Five-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month's net S&C charges, to be made on 1st June this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rental and S&C rebates is $39

million.   The  rebates will be given after  deducting  the  GST

offset  rebates,  the S&C grants associated with  the  utilities

rebates  and  a  special S&C monthly rebate, which  I  will  now

elaborate.

<br><br><b>Special Rebate on Town Council Service and Conservancy Charges</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide further help to tide over the present

difficulties,   Government  will  give  a  special   rebate   to

Singaporeans  living in HDB flats through  town  councils.   The

town councils will offer a one-off additional monthly rebate for

citizen  households living in 1 to 5-room flats for a period  of

one  year,  starting from 1st April 1999.  The special  rebates,

which  are  about  10%  of current gross  S&C  charges,  are  as

follows: $2 per month for 1-room flats, $3 per month for  2-room

flats,  $4  per month for 3-room flats, $5 per month for  4-room

flats  and  $6  per month for 5-room flats.  These rebates  will

cost Government an additional $40 million.

<br><br><b>Extension of GST-Related Offsets and Rebates for Two Years</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the difficult economic conditions, Government

had   announced  in  November last year  that  the  transitional

measures in the GST offset package, consisting of rental and S&C

rebates for 1 to 3-room HDB households, would be extended by two

more years.  The rental and S&C rebates are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Rental Rebates

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1-room flats: a rental rebate of $12 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2-room flats: a rental rebate of $8 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Rebates for S&C Charges

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1-room flats: $8 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2-room flats: $7 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 3-room flats: $4 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rebates is $22 million per year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low income households which are not living in HDB flats can

continue   to   receive  help  from  the  Citizens  Consultative

Committees  (CCCs) Assistance Scheme, which was set up  in  1994

when GST was implemented.

<br><br><b>Offset Package for Utilities Rates Revision</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government had in June 1997 announced the revision of

water  tariffs  and the water conservation tax to  uniform  flat

rates  for  all users.  There have so far been two increases  in

July 1997 and July 1998.  The next increase is scheduled for 1st

July 1999.  Despite the economic downturn, we must press on with

our  water  conservation  efforts and raise  water  tariffs  and

conservation tax as planned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water tariffs, including conservation tax, will

increase  by  15.3  cents  to 24.4 cents  per  cubic  metre  for

domestic  consumers.  The non-domestic water rate will  increase

by  5.8 cents per cubic metre to reach the target rate of  $1.52

per  cubic metre.  As part of the water conservation effort, the

waterborne fee will also be raised as scheduled, by 5 cents  per

cubic  metre for domestic consumers and 9 cents per cubic  metre

for non-domestic consumers with effect from 1st July 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to help lower income

households  cope with the increases in water charges.   In  1997

and  1998, a package of annual utilities rebates and monthly S&C

grants were given to citizens living in 1 to 4-room HDB flats to

offset  the increases in electricity and water rates.   To  help

the  lower  income  groups cope with the  economic  crisis,  the

Government  has  already  announced in November  1998  that  the

package  of  utilities rebates and monthly S&C grants  given  in

1997 and 1998 will be continued for another two years.  The cost

to Government is estimated at $73 million per year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As water charges are scheduled to increase further in July

1999, the Government has decided to double the utilities rebates

from $100 to $200 for 1 to 3-room HDB flats and from $50 to $100

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>

for  4-room  HDB  flats  in  1999.   This  will  cost

Government  an  additional  $41  million,  and  is   more   than

sufficient  to  offset  the increase in water  costs  for  lower

income households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utilities rebates will be credited against the

utilities  bills  of  eligible  households  for  the  month   of

September  which  are payable in October.  The  balance  of  the

rebate not consumed within the month will be carried over  until

it  is fully used up.  Grants for S&C charges to HDB lessees and

tenants,  ranging from $36 to $66 a year, will  continue  to  be

given.  The grants will start from July 1999 and will be $3  per

month for 1-room flats, $4 per month for 2-room flats, $5.50 per

month for 3-room flats and $4 per month for 4-room flats.  Those

lower income groups which do not live in HDB flats and hence are

unable to benefit from the utilities rebates and S&C grants  can

obtain help from the CCC Assistance Scheme.

<br><br><b>Tax Deduction of Certain Educational Expenses for Individuals</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore to transform successfully into a knowledge-based economy, the need for continual training and skills

upgrading  cannot be over emphasised.  Besides facilitating  and

providing  funding for numerous training schemes, the Government

would  also like to encourage individuals to take the initiative

to  improve  their  skills  and  knowledge.   Currently,  a  tax

deduction  of  up  to  $2,000  is allowed  for  actual  expenses

incurred  by  individuals  in pursuit of  further  academic  and

professional   qualifications,  or   vocational   qualifications

related  to their business, trade or employment.  I have decided

to  raise  the  tax  deduction cap to $2,500,  to  give  further

emphasis  to  the  importance of lifelong  learning  and  skills

upgrading.  The higher deduction cap of $2,500 will take  effect

from Year of Assessment 1999.  The revenue loss is estimated  to

be $4 million.

<div align="center"><b>OTHER TAX CHANGES</b></div>

<br><br><b>Property Tax Rebate</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 55% property tax rebate on industrial and commercial

properties, first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>

announced in the June 1998 off-budget measures,  will

be extended by another year to 30th June 2000.

<br><br><b>Stamp Duty for Contract Notes</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced in the November 1998 cost-cutting package, the

suspension of stamp duty on contract notes for share transaction

will now be extended by another year to 29th June 2000.



<div align="center"><b>CONCLUSION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has carefully calibrated

its  response  to  the regional crisis.  We have  taken  actions

commensurate  with  the situation we faced.   We  did  not  over

react.   As  a  result,  we  have won  the  confidence  of  both

Singaporeans and the international community in the way we  have

managed  the  crisis.  While there are some signs  of  stability

emerging  over the past few months, there still exist many  risk

factors  and  uncertainties  in our  external  environment.   We

cannot afford to be overly sanguine about the economic prospects

for  1999.   If  things should take a turn for  the  worse,  the

Government has the accumulated financial resources to cope  with

the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999 will be a test of our determination and of our nerves.

We must not abandon the fundamental policies that have served

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>

us well in the past.  At the same time, we have to  be

nimble  and  flexible  in  dealing  with  the  situation  as  it

develops.   We  will  continue  to  invest  in  our  future,  by

developing  a  world  class  infrastructure  and  enhancing  the

capability  of  our people and workforce.  I am  confident  that

Singaporeans  will pass the test, and we will  emerge  from  the

crisis stronger and leaner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. [Applause.]
