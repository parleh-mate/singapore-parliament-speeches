<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment as the Prime Minister has exhorted us  to  be

less reliant on Malaysia for our future water supply, one

alternative source is NEWater where there is some  public

concern over its quality and hygiene standards of  "real"

cleanliness, what measures have his Ministry in  mind  to

educate Singaporeans to accept NEWater.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after two years of comprehensive

physical,   chemical  and  microbiological  analyses   of

NEWater, the Panel of Experts formed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>

to  study the quality of NEWater has submitted its report

to  the  PUB on 2nd July 2002.  The Panel has made public

its  findings on NEWater at a press conference held  last

week.   Based on some 20,000 test results, the  Panel  of

Experts  has concluded that NEWater is safe for drinking.

It  has  met or surpassed all the standards for  drinking

water  set  by the World Health Organisation and  the  US

Environmental  Protection Agency.  In fact,  it  is  even

cleaner than PUB water.  In line with current practice in

the  USA on potable use of reclaimed water, the Panel has

recommended  that  NEWater be used for  indirect  potable

use,  that  is,  mixing NEWater with  raw  water  in  the

reservoirs  for  further  treatment  to  produce  potable

water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB is now studying the Experts Panel's report and

findings  and  will  make  its  recommendation   to   the

Government in about two months' time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of the Experts Panel's report will be made

available on PUB's NEWater website to be launched on  1st

August 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, to enhance public understanding of

NEWater, PUB has stepped up its public education  efforts

and will continue to do so in the coming months.  PUB has

started  briefing the grassroots and community leaders  a

few weeks ago.  Our public education programme will cover

various  areas.  For example, to assure the  public  that

NEWater  is  safe to drink, PUB explains  the  technology

employed  in  the production of NEWater as  well  as  the

quality it is able to attain with NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, to help overcome any psychological

barrier,  PUB explains the experience of the USA  in  the

use  of  reclaimed water over the last  20-30  years  for

indirect   potable  purpose.   At  two  of  the  briefing

sessions I attended personally, 98% of the grassroots and

community leaders, having understood the process involved

and  the quality achieved in NEWater, indicated that they

have no problem in drinking NEWater and accepting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>

the  idea of indirect potable use of NEWater.  The  other

2%  expressed  that  they still have  some  psychological

barrier  and  that  they  would like  to  understand  the

process  more before they are ready to fully embrace  the

idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB is now in the process of producing a

documentary on NEWater.  It will be telecast over the  TV

channels  in August.  PUB will make available VCD  copies

of  the  NEWater documentary to educational  institutions

and grassroots organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By early next year, the public can also come to

PUB's  new  Visitors' Centre at Bedok  Water  Reclamation

Plant  to see the actual operations of the NEWater plant.

They will be able to see at first hand the use of leading

edge membrane technology and ultra-violet process in  the

production of NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these efforts in public education, we are

confident  that Singaporeans will come to recognise  that

NEWater  is  indeed  a safe, affordable  and  sustainable

source  of  water supply for Singapore as we  strive  for

greater self-sufficiency in the future.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in the US where

water  reclamation has been carried out for more than  20

years,  only  one  or  two  of  the  three  methods  that

Singapore  is using had been used.  Why is there  a  need

for  us  to go through the three processes in Singapore's

case?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, the USA started the indirect

potable  use  of reclaimed water in the  early  70s.   In

those  days,  some of these plants were using traditional

filtration  method.   Over the years,  with  advances  in

membrane  technology, we are now able to  achieve  better

quality  at  a lower cost.  Technology has now  made  the

production  of reclaimed water more efficient  and  cost-effective.   In  the USA today, indirect potable  use  of

reclaimed  water  is a growing trend  as  more  and  more

cities  face  the  challenge  of  water  shortage.    Our

understanding is that new water reclamation plants in the

USA are increasingly using membrane technology.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three processes referred by Mdm Ho are what we

call  the dual-membrane and ultra-violet processes.  This

combination  of  processes is  gaining  popularity.   New

water  reclamation plants in the USA are moving  in  this

direction  of  adopting  dual-membrane  and  ultra-violet

processes.   Earlier  this year, our  NEWater  plant  was

awarded  the  excellent  award  by  the  National   Water

Research   Institution  in  the  USA  because   we   have

established  a benchmark that is as best as anywhere  you

can  find  in the world in terms of our ability  to  make

cost-effective use of technology to produce water quality

of the highest standard.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, since one of the three

methods  was  assessed to be sufficient  to  process  the

water,  as  in  the  US case, to what  extent  would  the

incremental  value be in having all three processes  done

for Singapore's case?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: would the additional two

or   three  processes  not  be  adding  to  the  cost  of

processing  the water and who would then be bearing  this

additional cost?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, firstly, let me explain that

even  though dual-membrane is a two-step process, it does

not  necessarily  lead to higher cost.  Let  me  explain.

With reverse osmosis, we are going to achieve the highest

quality  of  water.  What this means is that  before  the

water  goes through reverse osmosis, it has to go through

a stage of preparation first.  The whole purpose of micro-filtration or ultra-filtration used in the first step  of

membrane  application  is  to  filter  out  bigger   size

impurities, for example, bacteria.  By the time it  comes

to  reverse  osmosis, the process will be filtering  out,

for   example,  viruses  which  are  much  smaller   than

bacteria, as well as estrogenic compounds which are again

much smaller than viruses and bacteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the whole process is to remove impurities

in  a two-stage approach.  In this way, not only will  we

be  able to achieve higher quality water but, at the same

time, we will be able to optimise the cost performance of

dual membrane.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>

On the whole, it will lead to better cost optimisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mdm Ho asked who will bear the additional

cost.  Sir, I want to emphasise that the introduction  of

NEWater  does  not  add to higher cost  of  future  water

supply  in  Singapore.   In fact, the  whole  purpose  of

introducing  NEWater is to reduce the increased  cost  of

future  supply  of water in Singapore.   Members  of  the

House  will  remember  that until the  concept  of  water

reclamation   came  about,  the  next   alternative   for

Singapore  was  really  to go for desalination.   I  have

mentioned  in this House on 22nd May 2002 that  when  you

compare  the  cost of water reclamation - NEWater  versus

desalination  - in terms of capital cost,  the  cost  for

NEWater is about half that of desalination.  In terms  of

energy  consumption, it is about one-quarter to one-fifth

that  of  desalination.  As a result, the total  cost  of

NEWater  production is about half that  of  desalination.

In  other  words,  the introduction of  NEWater  actually

helps  us  to prevent the need to increase the prices  of

water  in  the  future  because  with  this  lower   cost

alternative, we are now able to better contain  the  cost

of water in the future.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister  how  soon  does  he  think  that  the

Government   will  want  to  use  NEWater  for   domestic

purposes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, as I have mentioned earlier,

PUB is now looking into the recommendation by the Experts

Panel  and  PUB expects to put forward its recommendation

to  the Government sometime in September.  Based on PUB's

recommendation,   the  ENV  will  then   work   out   the

introduction plan.  At this moment, I would not  want  to

jump  the  gun because the next step is for PUB to  study

the  recommendation from the Experts Panel  carefully  so

that  by the time it comes to a decision, we will be able

to move forward with complete confidence.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister whether there is any plan to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>

use  NEWater  directly and whether there is any  need  to

improve  the NEWater further by altering the  PH  of  the

NEWater after production?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, NEWater will be used in two

ways.  Firstly, for  non-potable use in industry and  the

commercial  sector, NEWater will be used directly.   This

will begin in January next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked whether there is any need to

adjust  the  PH  level of NEWater.  The  answer  is  yes,

because  NEWater  is so pure that the PH  level  at  this

moment  is  about 6.2 to 6.5 which is below  the  neutral

level  of 7.  So what PUB will do is that NEWater,  after

production, will be stabilised before it is delivered  to

the wafer fab plants starting in January next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second purpose is for potable use. As I have

mentioned earlier, the Experts Panel is recommending that

we  make  use  of NEWater for potable use in an  indirect

manner.   This  means pumping NEWater into the  reservoir

and  mixing  it  with raw water in the  reservoir.   From

there, it will be reprocessed again into PUB water.

local  catchments.  By linking up the various reservoirs,

PUB  will  be  able to balance any mismatch  between  the

amount  of rainfall collected in the catchment areas  and

their  respective  reservoir  storage  capacities.   This

linking-up  is  done through underground pipelines.   PUB

therefore  does  not  expect  any  adverse  environmental

have no adverse impact on the environment.

<div align="center"><b>(Singapore's position)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr R. Ravindran</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  what is Singapore's position on the proposal  by

Thailand to create an Asia Co-operation Dialogue.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Thailand hosted the first

meeting  of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) from  18-20th  June this year.  I was among the 17 representatives

from Asian participating countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Prime Minister Goh visited Thailand in February

this  year, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  asked  for

Singapore's  support  for  his  proposal  on   the   Asia

Cooperation Dialogue.  Prime Minister agreed  to  support

this  initiative.  We supported it in view of  our  long-standing  approach  of  advocating  a  more  outward  and

forward-looking ASEAN and Asia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ACD hopes to bring together countries in West

Asia,  the  Gulf  countries, South Asia, ASEAN  and  East

Asia.  Although there are many existing regional and sub-regional organisations in Asia, such as ASEAN, ARF, South

Asian   Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC),

Indian  Ocean  Rim  Association for Regional  Cooperation

(IOR-ARC)  and  the Gulf Cooperation Council,  there  is,

however, minimal interaction between them.  The  ACD,  if

properly  nurtured,  could  eventually  bridge  the   gap

between these different regional groupings in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent ACD meeting, all the Foreign Ministers

present were of the view that the organisation was a good

and timely idea, but they cautioned that the ACD must  be

inclusive,  not  a closed grouping nor  should  it  be  a

regional bloc.  It should also avoid duplicating the work

of  existing  regional organisations.  The  meeting  also

discussed  many  ideas and proposals aimed  at  promoting

greater   cooperation  within  Asia.    Singapore's   own

suggestion was that the ACD countries could cooperate  in

the  area of SMEs, because SMEs comprise a large  segment

of employment in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the ACD could facilitate closer

cooperation  amongst SMEs in the region.  Singapore  will

work  closely with Thailand which is the coordinator  for

the ACD in the coming year.

<div align="center"><b>AVERAGE EARNINGS OF FEMALES AND WAGE GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Manpower (a)

what are the average monthly earnings of resident females

from  1997  - 2001; and (b) whether the wage gap  between

men and women is getting narrower.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, based on the Central Provident Fund Board's

records,   the  average  monthly  earnings   of   females

increased from $2,256 in 1998 to $2,588 in 2001, or at  a

rate   of  4.7%  per  annum  during  the  period.   After

discounting for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>

inflation, the real earnings rose from $2,263  to  $2,535

at  an  annualised rate of 3.9% during the  same  period.

Earnings data prior to 1998 are not comparable due  to  a

change  in  the collection methodology.  The hon.  Member

asked  for  data  from 1997.  Because of  the  change  in

collection  methodology,  I gave  the  figures  for  1998

onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, females in Singapore generally earn less than

males  at  the aggregate level.  This is not  unlike  the

experience in many other countries.  In 2001, the average

monthly earnings of females was 72% that of males.   This

reflects  the  higher concentration of females  in  lower

paying   occupations   due  to  the  poorer   educational

attainment  of the older cohorts of female workers.   The

tendency  for  females  to withdraw  from  the  workforce

because of childcare and household responsibilities  also

reduced  the  average years of service and experience  of

working  females.  With our seniority-based wage  system,

females, as a group, will therefore earn less than males.

For  the younger age group, the wage gap differential  is

generally smaller.  In fact, in the age group  of  25  to

29,  women  working as managers, professionals, associate

professionals  and  technicians, and  service  and  sales

workers  actually earn more than their male counterparts.

Other  factors contributing to the gender wage  disparity

include  differences in skills, qualifications, age,  job

nature and position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage gap was largely unchanged over the last few

years.  It was also 72% in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the underlying concern in Dr Neo's question on

wage  gap is whether women in Singapore are discriminated

against in employment.  Average monthly earnings of women

have  significantly  increased  over  the  years.   While

differences  in  wages  still  exist,  I  would  like  to

emphasise that it is not the result of discrimination  at

work.   Rather,  it  is  due  to legitimate  work-related

reasons  such  as working experience, years  of  service,

types of jobs held and skills, as I mentioned earlier.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy on employment is based on

the  principles  of equal opportunities and  meritocracy.

Our  employment  practice emphasises equal  opportunities

for  all, and a reward system based on performance.   The

Singapore  Civil Service adopted the principle  of  equal

pay  for  equal work since 1962.  NTUC and its affiliated

unions   make  no  distinction  between  male  or  female

members.  In collective agreements signed between  unions

and  employers, the principle of equal pay  for  work  of

equal value is the norm.  In addition, the National Wages

Council,  which is the national tripartite advisory  body

on  wages, formulates wage increase guidelines each  year

based  on  key economic indicators, such as  GDP  growth,

productivity,       inflation      and      international

competitiveness.   This  has enabled  Singapore  workers,

both  men and women, to enjoy a fair share of the  fruits

of economic growth.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he

is  satisfied with the rate of the narrowing of the  wage

gap  in the past five years?  What has his Ministry  done

to narrow this gap?  And what else can be done to further

accelerate the narrowing of this wage gap?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot say

that we are completely satisfied with the situation.   We

will  want  to  work towards a point in future  that  the

skills and qualifications of the women workers are  equal

to  that  of men, so that they will be able to  earn  the

same  pay.   On a national basis, looking in total,  this

will  take  time, because we still have many  cohorts  of

older  women.   And  if we look at the education  of  the

older  women, they tend to lag behind that of their  male

counterparts in the same age cohort.  The way  to  narrow

this  gap is, in fact, through education.  As I mentioned

earlier  on in my main reply, in the age group of  25  to

29,  the  women  actually earn more than  the  men.   And

through better education, we will find the women entering

the  labour force will have as good an education, and  as

good a training as their male counterparts, and they will

earn the same wages as their male counterparts.  So, with

education, we will gradually narrow the gap.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Ministry done? In terms of continuing

education  and  training,  my  Ministry  also  makes   no

distinction  between male and female  workers.   We  give

equal encouragement and support to women who come forward

to  undergo skills retraining or upgrading.  In fact,  we

have   many  programmes  which  help  the  lower  skilled

workers,  and you will find a disproportionate number  of

women  among  the lower skilled.  They are the  ones  who

stand  to  best  benefit from this programme  for  skills

upgrading.   And we will continue to implement programmes

to  help the lower skilled to uplift their skills for the

new  jobs in the new economy.  This is the way for us  to

speed up the narrowing of the wage gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can be done? As I said, we will continue

to  look  at  more  skills upgrading programmes  for  the

cohorts  of  women  who  are already  in  the  workforce,

particularly  the  older women in their  40s  and  above.

They  have  poorer education and lower level  of  skills.

The  way for them to narrow the wage gap is, in fact,  to

go  for skills upgrading, and take advantage of the  many

programmes  that  we  have, whether it  is  the  National

Skills   Recognition  System,  the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme  or  one  of our strategic manpower  conversion

programmes that will help them to acquire new skills  for

jobs   in   different   areas.   If   they   take   these

opportunities to upgrade themselves, I am sure they  will

be able to earn a higher wage.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister for the

outcome of the study which he agreed to look into when  I

raised  the  issue  of  the  wage  gap  in  1997  on  the

challenges  faced  by women in employment,  such  as  the

general opinion of the employers with regard to the  role

of  women  in  the workplace, and also the difficulty  of

balancing work with family responsibilities?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1997, or

earlier   than  that,  my  Ministry  has  been   actively

promoting   family-friendly  human  resource   management

practices.  We have given awards to recognise firms  with

practices    which    are    actually    family-friendly,

particularly  for their women workers.  We will  continue

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>

do  so.  We will continue to explore how we can encourage

companies   and   employers  to   adopt   family-friendly

practices for their female workers in order to allow them

to  better balance their career and also the needs of the

mothers  and wives to manage the home.  These are  issues

which are constantly being looked at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the specific study that the hon.

Member  said that she raised in 1997, I have to  look  it

up, because I do not have the answer with me right now.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, one of the reasons cited for

the wage gap of females compared to their counterparts is

that they have withdrawn from the workforce to mind their

children.  I would like to ask the Minister whether there

is  a  possibility for a scheme to be examined  which  is

similar to the National Service scheme for NSmen to  make

up  for  the  loss of their 21/2 years' national  service

training.   Normally,  they are given   increments.   For

women  who  withdraw  from  the  workforce  to  do  their

"national  service" in looking after their  children,  if

they should re-enter the workforce, is there a chance for

them  to  be  given  some  kind of  recognition  for  the

"national service" that they have performed, so  that  we

minimise the wage gap between male and female workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there

is  a  tendency  to try to draw parallels  all  over  the

place,  and  we  can arrive at very unusual  conclusions.

The  reason  why  Government gives  increments  to  NSmen

within  the  civil  service and  encourages  the  private

sector  to give the males who have to perform 21/2  years

of national service the same recognition is self-evident.

Because  they have to give up 21/2 years of their  career

to  perform national service at a very nominal  allowance

from the Ministry of Defence.  So, we try to make up  for

them  by encouraging employers in the private sector  and

in  the  civil  service to give them two increments  when

they join the service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for women taking time off to mind their families

and look after the children, I think there are many other

ways people can balance work and home.  To have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>

rigid  structure whereby you say that the  employer  will

have  to pay the woman worker X number of credits by  way

of  increments upon rejoining the company after a certain

number of years, I think this would increase the rigidity

in  our labour market.  The more rigid we make our labour

market,  the  more difficult it is for us to achieve  the

kind  of  growth and competitiveness that we  want.   The

world  is  not getting any more friendlier  in  terms  of

economic  competition.  On the contrary,  competition  is

heating  up.   The more we introduce these little  tweaks

here  and there, the more difficult we will make  it  for

the  women  to  get  work in the future.   So,  far  from

helping  women,  such  rigidity may discriminate  against

women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge Members to be careful when

advancing ideas about how we want to help the women.  The

way to help them is actually through education and skills

training.  If we equip them well, they will be needed  by

the employers when the economy turns around and picks up.

They will command a wage that the market will decide  and

the  employers will pay.  If we try to include all  these

little  ideas  of how to favour them, we will  discourage

employers from employing more women.  So, let us be  very

careful  about what we want to do.  Are we here  to  help

the  women workers to bridge the gap, or are we going  to

make  life more difficult for them?  I would urge you  to

be  very circumspect in proposing such measures.  On  the

part  of the Government, we will continue to try to  help

and  equip  our  women workforce, which is  half  of  the

population.   If  we  do not give  them  every  means  to

upgrade themselves so that they can perform well  in  the

new  economy,  then  we  are doing  ourselves  a  serious

disservice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure all hon. Members that Government will

pay  particular  attention to  the  needs  of  the  women

workers, to help them bridge this gap.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I think

definitely making things structurally rigid is not  good.

But I would like to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>

ask  the Minister what his Ministry and, in fact, all the

other Ministries that he might be able to influence,  are

doing, in terms of actually changing mindset, and this is

where  Government  can take the lead,  because  promoting

responsibility  of  the  father and  husband  is  a  very

important  thing.   I think the recent changes  in  child

sick  leave  is  a good example.  But will  his  Ministry

pursue  and encourage right across civil service more  of

this  type  of benefits?  In fact, the approach  and  the

mindset  of  Government  should be  to  encourage  better

sharing of responsibilities, because ultimately that  is,

in fact, the way to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister has focused very much on the

schemes to educate and retrain to close the gap.  But  he

also  mentioned in the beginning of his answer that  part

of  it  is  that  women are in jobs that  pay  less.   My

question  is: are we doing a review of why  this  is  so?

Because, I think, society places values on jobs,  and  we

are  very  prone to just paying for the jobs  that  bring

direct  economic benefit and we do not give enough weight

to  the  jobs  that enable the economic  activity  to  be

carried out in terms of, for example, child care-type  or

teaching-type jobs.  Well, teaching in Singapore has been

pretty  much taken care of.  But there is a value put  on

the jobs, and it so happens that those ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, put your question. No

speeches, please.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sorry. Will the Ministry review

the  way jobs are structured and valued to see if we  can

move this in the right direction?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to

the  Nominated Member's first point, yes,  I  agree  with

her.   We should continue to work, we should continue  to

chisel  away  at  some mindset about how  to  help  women

better cope with work and family.  I mentioned earlier on

things  that  give  recognition to companies  that  adopt

family-friendly practices.  I think this would help.  But

it is not going to result in an overnight transformation.

The  civil  service will also incorporate some  of  these

ideas

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>

about  family-friendly practices, and gradually more  can

be  adopted where it is possible.  I think this is  being

looked at.  Various Ministries, including the PSD,  would

be looking at how they can make work in the civil service

more family-friendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point about some jobs

commanding  a lower salary and whether the Ministry  will

look  at  how these jobs are rated, we know,  of  course,

that  we  do not have wage controls, and we do  not  have

minimal wages in Singapore for very good reason,  ie,  to

allow  the  marketplace to operate freely.   I  think  it

would  be  quite  difficult, and I do  not  think  it  is

desirable  for  us to go around setting wages  for  child

care givers or teachers, or for other vocations.  We have

to accept that wages are best set by the market to ensure

that   there   is  appropriate  reward  for  the   effort

contributed.  If, in fact, there is a serious shortage of

child  care  givers  in  our  child  care  centres,   for

instance,  then the market will respond.  The people  who

operate  child care centres will have to bid  higher  for

the  workers that they need, and for the quality  of  the

workers that they need, they will have to pay more.   So,

I  think, we must let the market forces operate.   It  is

either  we believe in it or we do not.  Then, we have  to

go  in  and  start setting wages for every sector,  every

vocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, let me cite an interesting point,

which  is  that  occupational groups show  the  wage  gap

between  male  and  female.   For  instance,  within   an

occupational  group,  there  may  be  a  wage  difference

between male and female.  But the occupational groups are

fairly  large.  So you have, for instance, a group called

plant   and  machine  operators  within  an  occupational

classification of our labour force.  You will  find  that

males  tend  to  earn  a lot more than  females  in  this

occupational group.  Is it because they are discriminated

against?   Or  is it because the work they  do  is  being

under-valued?   The answer is no.  The  answer  is  that,

interestingly  enough,  in this  particular  occupational

group, females tend to concentrate in occupations such as

electronic component assembly.  They work

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>

in  an electronics factory as assembly production workers

which  generally pays less than the other group of  plant

and  machinery operators, which include bus drivers,  for

instance.   There are not that many female  bus  drivers,

and  bus  drivers are paid quite well compared  to  these

assembly line workers in an electronics factory.  So,  as

a  result,  you  will find that within this  occupational

group,  there is this difference in wage gap.  So  should

we  then  go in and tell employers that, no, within  this

occupational group, you have a big wage gap, you have  to

do  something  to  fix that wage gap,  and  you  have  to

address  the fact that the women are earning less?   But,

in  fact, within every occupational group, you find  this

distortion.  So, it is not easy for us to go in nor is it

desirable  for  us to artificially go and try  to  bridge

this  gap.  As I said, the only way to bridge the gap  is

to equip the women with the skills to do the higher value-added jobs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said

earlier that he did not have the outcome of the study  of

the  wage gap.  But, am I not asking the question on wage

gap  today?   Therefore, am I supposed  to  file  another

Question  for  Oral  Answer to get  the  results?   I  am

disappointed because I feel that the Minister could  have

better prepared for this Question for Oral Answer.  May I

ask the Minister on his point that he was trying to close

the skills gaps between the men and women.  But, am I not

correct  to say that according to the study done  by  his

Ministry, in fact, the skills and the educational profile

of  the  female labour force closely match that of  their

male counterparts?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my next question is: Could he give the House an

explanation  why  is  it  that female  workers  form  the

majority of the lowest gross monthly income, according to

the data by the Ministry of Manpower, as at June 1999?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next question is, despite all these facts, why is

it  that  women are still very much under-represented  in

the administrative and managerial positions?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have

prepared myself to answer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>

this  question on wage gap.  I do not see any  reason  or

justification to say that I have not adequately given the

hon. Member an answer on the wage gap.  With regard to  a

previous  study,  if she has a specific interest  in  the

outcome on whatever other studies that she requested for,

we will be prepared to address those points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would take her last point about females having the

lowest gross monthly income.  I think this is taken as  a

group,  as a whole, and I have spent some time to explain

why  this  is  so - partly because of our seniority-based

wage  scale system.  If you take any group, you will find

within  the  group,  as  I  mentioned  earlier  on,   the

occupational  group of plant and machinery  operators,  a

situation where women tend to congregate at a lower  wage

level, simply because they are actually doing those  jobs

-  electronics factory production workers rather than men

doing   more  higher  value-added  jobs  operating   more

complicated and sophisticated machinery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see what other explanation is there to

give,  apart from what I have already said that the women

are  having  this  lower income or earn lower  wages  for

fairly  sound reasons.  Not that I agree with  them,  but

the reasons are the results of history.  20-30 years ago,

not  all  the women got the same education as their  male

counterparts in that cohort.  It just was not so.  Today,

the  women  in  their 40s and late 40s generally  have  a

lower  level  of  education and skills  than  their  male

counterparts.  Therefore, they are not doing exactly  the

same job; so, they do not get the same pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me why there are fewer women in

management and executive positions, this will change.  As

I  said, for the younger cohort, they are already as well

educated  as  their  male  counterparts.   They  will  be

competing  for  the same jobs.  But in our  system  where

there  is seniority-based wage scale, those women who  do

not  want to carry on with their career development,  who

drop out of the

workforce well before they make it to the higher level of

management structure, will result in the group as a whole

again still having a lower pay.  Because for everyone who

drops  out,  you find a man has moved ahead of  a  woman.

So,  as a result, taking the women as a group, they  will

be  at the lower end of the pyramid, and more men will be

moving  up to the higher level of the management pyramid.

As  a  result, if you take the group as a whole, men will

still  be earning more than women.  But that is a  choice

on  the part of the women.  Do they want to carry  on  to

develop  their career to the fullest, go to  the  highest

level in management?  This, in our system of meritocracy,

is  entirely up to the women to choose.  It is  a  matter

for  them to choose, to decide how far they want  to  go,

how  do  they balance their home and career.   I  do  not

think  we  should have a system where we  guarantee  that

within   our   labour  force,  there  should   be   equal

representation,   or  a  guarantee  in   our   management

structure that there should be equal representation.  The

fact  is this is how the market operates.  If women  want

to  make  the  effort  to  excel  in  their  career,  the

opportunities are there.  There is a level playing field.

They  can compete for the job; they can compete  for  the

position,  and  they will be paid for their  performance.

And  I  think this is a fair system, and it is  a  system

that should be allowed to continue.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, we have just

ratified  ILO  Convention 100 on equal pay  for  work  of

equal  value.   Is  this  disparity  in  income  not   in

compliance with the Convention?  Secondly, the Convention

also  requires  us  to put in place  some  mechanism  for

monitoring wages for both males and females.   What  kind

of  mechanism will be put in place by MOM, in  compliance

with this Convention?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before we

ratified  Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration,  we  have

already  studied  our  legislative framework.   There  is

nothing  in our legislative framework that will  disallow

us  from  complying with the requirements  of  Convention

100.  We are already in full compliance.  The fact

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>

that  this wage gap exists does not mean that we are  not

in  compliance.  For your information, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

many   other  countries  that  have  ratified  the   same

convention  also have a similar wage gap,  for  instance,

the   United   Kingdom,   Australia,   Sweden,   Finland,

Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Japan, Korea,  Luxembourg.

These  are  all  developed  countries.   They  are   also

countries with a wage gap.  So, having a wage gap per  se

does  not  mean  that  one  is  not  in  compliance  with

Convention 100.  They will have to look at the details of

the  statistics.   As  I  said in the  main  answer,  our

practice and implementation of wage policy are fair.   It

does  not  discriminate against women.  We pay  the  same

wages  for the same work that is being done. If ILO  were

to query why a wage gap arises in Singapore's context, we

will be able to explain why this wage gap has arisen,  as

in  the  same  way  that I am trying to explain  to  this

House.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, with so

many  women speaking, I feel compelled to join the  crowd

so  that  all  of us can speak.  I fully agree  with  the

Minister  that the solution to bridge the gap is  through

education.  But you find that, in the future, when  women

get  more  educated, it will be a waste if we  lose  this

very valuable resource when family kicks in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether you can help change the rules.

I think it is all very well to say that discrimination is

not  there.   But it is true that, when the family  kicks

in,  the  woman takes a back seat and she will  lose  her

skills if she does not actively try to get back into  the

workforce.  So I wonder whether you could help change the

mindset  and start much more earlier in the  day  in  the

education  process to tell the women that life  is  about

various  stages  and to think ahead for the  future.   We

should  change women's mindset on how they can  get  back

into the workforce, how to help change processes, helping

them  to  work  from  home, how to actively  change  work

processes within the workplace so that women can continue

to  retain a level of skills and to get connected to  the

workplace so that, when their children are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>

growing, they can get back actively into the workforce.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, we in fact

already  do  some  of these works.  We have  a  programme

called "Back-to-Work".  Back-to-Work is a programme  that

was designed to help women who have left the workforce to

be  retrained before re-entering the workforce.  And  the

whole  Back-to-Work  programme  is  also  geared  towards

giving moral support and encouragement to women who  have

left  the  workforce for some years and now want  to  re-enter  it  but  because  of the  change  in  the  working

environment,  they do not feel adequate or prepared.   So

the Back-to-Work programme addresses these issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Back-to-Work programme during this

period  of  high  unemployment  is  a  bit  difficult  to

implement because, first, you got to have the  jobs.   We

started  the  programme  in 1996  when  the  economy  was

booming,  tight labour market and very limited supply  of

workers.  So we introduced this Back-to-Work programme to

try  to  draw  the women who had left the workforce  back

into  it.   But  since then, the economic  situation  has

turned  unfavourably.  Jobs have been harder to come  by.

I  remember I did inform this House during the  Committee

of  Supply  that we are in fact putting this at  a  lower

priority  instead.  Maybe when the economy turns  around,

or  when we encounter a similar situation where there are

more  jobs available, then we should refine this Back-to-Work  programme to address precisely the issue  that  the

Member has mentioned, ie, how to help women re-enter  the

workforce after a period of time spent with the family.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The Minister said earlier that more

women are in the electronics factory jobs.  May I ask the

Minister  whether it is correct to say that  as  many  as

34,000   female  workers  were  retrenched  during   this

economic  downturn?  May I ask the Minister how  many  of

them  were  redeployed and how many of them received  the

skills retraining programme?  My next question is:  am  I

correct to say that there are as many as 119,000 female

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>

workers  earning below $400 compared to the total  number

of  about 172,000 of such workers?  What kind of help can

we give to these workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I said that

there  are  more women in the factories doing electronics

assembly  line  type  of work, I  was  referring  to  the

occupational  grouping of plant and machinery  operators.

Is  your  question on how many of the retrenched  workers

are women?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> In the figure of 34,000.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> What was your question?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> My question was actually - may I just

add - since many of them came from the manufacturing jobs

that will not come back, how many were redeployed?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I think the re-employment rate,

on  the  whole,  is probably about 60%-odd,  that  means,

about six out of 10 of those who were retrenched were re-employed.   Many  who were re-employed  probably  end  up

taking  a  lower  paying job than what  they  had  before

because  the employment market is not so favourable  now.

As to how many of them had undergone specific retraining,

I  do  not have the figures with me.  I know that, for  a

start,  our Skills Redevelopment Programme has a  lot  of

women  participation  in  it.  Many  of  the  electronics

factory  workers who were retrenched, or whose jobs  were

vulnerable to retrenchment, in fact, had undergone skills

redevelopment training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the 119,000 women, whom the Member quoted as

earning  less than $400 a month, she asked what  type  of

jobs  they  are in.  I think most of these  are  actually

part-time  workers supplementing the family  income.   Of

course,  some of them could be doing the lower-end  jobs,

in  conservancy type of work.  But I think you will  find

quite a number of women doing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>

part-time work, for instance, NTUC FairPrice supermarkets

employ  a  fairly  large complement of cashiers  who  are

women  doing  part-time work because these are  the  jobs

that are conveniently located within the new towns, close

to  their  homes, and many women like to  take  on  these

jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> The Minister has cited the

lagging salary between the male and female as one of  the

reasons  for  the gap.  Has his Ministry found  that  the

lagging  salary  between the male and female  constitutes

one  of  the  reasons for our difficulties in luring  the

better educated women back to work?  And if that were so,

what is his Ministry doing to address this issue?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the salary gap,

as  I  said  in  my  main  answer,  is  one  of  national

statistics.  You take all the women workers on one  side,

you  average their salary, you take all the male  workers

on the other side, average their salary, and you get this

gap  of 72%.  But, in fact, if you look at the women with

their male counterparts, if they are of equal capability,

equal seniority, doing the same jobs in the company, I do

not  think  they  are  paid  any  less  than  their  male

counterpart.   So  the point that you mentioned  in  your

question  does  not  arise.  You  are  confusing  overall

statistics with an individual situation.  We have overall

statistics  which  show  a gap.  But  at  the  individual

level, it is a totally level playing field.  A woman  who

has  the same years of seniority in the company, who does

exactly  the same job, will get the same pay as the  male

worker.  I do not think there are companies that practise

this  kind of discrimination.  I know that the  NTUC,  in

their  collective  agreements,  ensures  that  all  their

members,  regardless of whether they are male  or  female

workers,  get exactly the same salary for doing the  same

work.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

just  going  back  a little bit to the ILO,  under  CEDAW

(Convention  on  Elimination  of  Discrimination  Against

Women)  and  our  legalistic framework, the  Constitution

states that everyone is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>

same,  whatever  race or religion,  and  the  part  about

gender  is  missing, and that is why we have  signed  the

CEDAW  with reservation.  How then would the Ministry  be

in   compliance  with  the  ILO  where  this   legalistic

framework, to a certain extent, in my opinion, is lacking

where   gender   issues  and  wage  differentiation   are

concerned as a result of that?  Could you please  explain

how  the  Ministry sees these two documents, the ILO  and

CEDAW and our legalistic framework?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before we ratify

any  international  convention, we will  quite  carefully

study  the  obligations  under the  convention.   We  had

studied  our obligations under Convention 100, regardless

of  what the Nominated Member mentioned.  I would like to

assure this House that we will not be in violation of the

requirements of Convention 100.  We will be able to  meet

the    statutory   requirement   after   ratifying   this

Convention.  As I have explained, the Government does not

practise  any  discrimination in its  wage  policy.   The

employment   market   itself  does  not   practise   wage

discrimination.  Wages are different because they are not

doing  the same job.  That is the basic point.   I  think

ILO  will  understand  why  this  is  so.   There  is  no

regulation that explicitly says that women should be paid

less  than  men.   In  fact, it  is  the  contrary.   The

principle   of   the  Government  has  all   along   been

meritocracy.  If you are doing the same job, you will  be

getting the same reward.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Neo, I think I shall allow only one

last  question  because I do not see us getting  anywhere

further with this question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I disagree

with the Minister's answer to my earlier question when he

said  that the reason for women workers earning less than

$400 was because quite a number of them were working part-time.   Could I quote the Minister the following  figures

to  make  my  point?  The total number of  women  workers

earning less than $400 a month is 129,737, and after

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>

deducting  the  number  working  part-time,  50,802,  and

temporary  part-time, 12,831, and some working  full-time

flexi  hours,  15,085,  the number of  women,  supposedly

working full-time, yet earning less than $400 a month, is

in fact 51,019, or 2.5%, of the labour force.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take the

point.  There are women working part-time who are earning

below $400.  I gave some examples.  There are also women,

as  I  mentioned, doing conservancy type  of  jobs,  like

cleaning job, that earn less than $400.

Primary  1 Registration at the end of this month (a)  how

many  volunteers and officers are on the team to  counsel

parents who are not eager to register their children into

schools;   (b) what is the composition of this  team  and

their  experience in counselling;  (c) what is the nature

of  training that the team has received;  (d)  when  will

the  team  start its work in assessing reluctant parents;

and (e) when will it make its final recommendation to the

Ministry for further action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are measures already in place to

trace  parents  who  do not register  their  children  in

school.   At the end of the Primary 1 School Registration

Exercise,  children who were born six years earlier,  and

who  have not registered with national schools are  first

identified.   Letters will be sent to  their  parents  to

inquire on the reasons for non-registration.  Where there

is no response, officers (these are not counsellors) will

be assigned to trace these children.  These officers will

try  their  best  to  find  the  families  based  on  the

information  available.  This will include house  visits.

The officers will investigate the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>

reasons  behind their non-registration.  If  the  parents

have financial or domestic problems, they will be advised

to  approach the CDCs for further assistance.   From  our

past  experience, however, such cases are not  prevalent.

There was an average of less than 10 such cases over  the

last few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of Compulsory Education in

2003, actions will not stop at tracking the children  and

referring  the  family  to community  organisations.    A

parent  who still does not register his child for Primary

One  will  be counselled.  MOE does not have  a  standing

pool of its own Counsellors to undertake this task.   The

Ministry  will instead engage qualified counsellors  from

community organisations, like the Family Service  Centres

and  the  Voluntary  Welfare  Organisations  (VWOs),   to

undertake  the counselling.  If counselling,  and  repeat

counselling does not work, and all efforts at helping the

parent  fail, he will then be referred to the  Compulsory

Education Board.  The Board will review the case, and can

decide  to call the parent to the Board, send the  parent

for  further  counselling,  or  refer  the  case  to  the

Director General of Education who is empowered under  the

Compulsory  Education Act to raise  a  complaint  to  the

Subordinate Courts for legal action.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, how would the

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Ministry  seeks  to  track  the  parents  based  on   all

available  information.   It is not  always  possible  to

track  the parents down.  Some may have left the country,

some are no longer at their last registered address.  But

the  Ministry has been able to track the majority of  the

parents of children who have not registered in the past.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOOL-BASED COUNSELLORS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number of trained social workers or psychologists)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a) how many of its present group  of  school-based   counsellors   are  trained  social   workers   or

psychologists; and (b) how does his Ministry monitor  the

appointment and performance of these counsellors  in  the

respective schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, counselling support in

schools is provided by a tiered system comprising trained

teacher counsellors, MOE-appointed school counsellors and

external counsellors engaged by schools on a need  basis.

Counselling services are also provided by the  Ministry's

psychologists and guidance specialists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher counsellors and MOE-appointed school

counsellors  are  teachers or retired education  officers

with professional training in counselling; they need  not

be  trained  in social work or psychology.   Given  their

background   as  educators  and  certified  training   in

counselling,  these personnel are well equipped  to  meet

the  basic emotional needs of students.  For cases  of  a

more complex nature or which require the services of more

qualified   counsellors,   schools   engage   them   from

organisations that specialise in counselling work.   Most

schools have indeed been doing so on a regular basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are given a directory of organisations that

provide  professional counselling services.  The majority

of the counsellors engaged by our schools work

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>

at organisations dedicated to counselling, such as Family

Service  Centres.   All external counsellors  engaged  by

schools  have  relevant  training and  qualifications  in

guidance and counselling, psychology or social work, with

60% having a basic or Masters degree in these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal of the school has ultimate management

responsibility over the counselling services rendered  to

students   by   the  teacher  counsellors,  MOE-appointed

counsellors  and  external counsellors  that  the  school

engages.   The  principal would  usually  appoint  a  key

member of the staff - typically the head of pupil welfare

or  the vice-principal - to help oversee the process  and

monitor   the   performance  of  the  counsellors.    The

Ministry's  guidance specialists also help the  principal

in professional supervision of the school counsellors.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it has been said that for the external counsellors,

the  funds  that  the  schools  have  are  generally  not

adequate   to  have  a  full-fledged  system  of   school

counselling  or school social work and that this  impedes

the effectiveness of some of these programmes.  Would the

Minister care to comment, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

is  no lack of funds in most schools.  The principal  has

the  latitude  to  decide how best to  deploy  the  funds

available   to  the  school,  how  much  to   deploy   in

counselling,   and   how  much  to   rely   on   external

counsellors.   Funding has not been a  constraint.   Over

90%  of  our schools engage external counsellors, and  of

those  that  do,  about two-thirds use counsellors  on  a

regular  basis,  meaning at least  three  hours  a  week.

These figures indicate that there is really no constraint

on the schools' ability to engage external counsellors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  would  the Ministry consider allowing teachers  who

prefer  to  do  counselling as a career to  change  their

career  path  from  that of teaching to  counselling,  to

increase the pool of professional counsellors?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

not  necessary  to set up a new career track  within  the

Education   Service   for   such   professionals.    But,

certainly,  if  a teacher is talented in counselling  and

has  a  strong interest in engaging in this, how best  we

deploy  that  teacher, what the responsibilities  of  the

teacher  are,  what percentage of the time  is  spent  on

counselling, are matters that can be looked at.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, a clarification to

Question  6  (b).   How  does the  Ministry  monitor  the

appointment?   I know the Minister had replied  to  that,

but  could we have a few more details, especially in  the

light that in certain schools the situation can get a bit

desperate  and  schools may be obliged to employ  certain

candidates  whom they deem suitable and they  are  in  an

environment with a lot of children, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

not   sure  I  fully  understand  the  question.   Within

schools,  there  is  a  proper  system  to  monitor   the

activities of the external counsellors.  It is usually  a

senior member of the school staff, ie, vice-principal  or

head  of  pupil  welfare, who oversees and  monitors  the

counselling  process.  We do not know of any  significant

or  widespread  problems  in schools  arising  from  poor

quality  counselling.  We know that there  is  a  limited

pool of counsellors in Singapore, but the schools have so

far  not  had  great  difficulty in having  the  problems

addressed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, how

does  the  Ministry  monitor the effectiveness  of  these

external  counsellors?   If everything  is  left  to  the

school,   how  does  the  Ministry  ensure   that   these

counsellors are effective in their work and what  is  the

extent of the effectiveness?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

principally  a  responsibility of the  principal  of  the

school rather than the Ministry.  The Ministry's guidance

specialists  do  help the principal in  undertaking  this

task,  but  this  is really a task for the  principal  to

handle.  If we had in fact

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>

evidence  of problems that are building up that  are  not

being  addressed,  then the Ministry  might  have  to  do

something  more.  At this stage, the problems  are  being

quite well addressed.

cases in year 2001, and 16 cases for the first six months

of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a study carried out by MCDS on elderly

suicides   between  1995  and  2001,  poor   health   and

depression  were  the main reasons for  elderly  suicide.

This   is   consistent  with  the  findings  of  research

conducted in other Asian countries.  Elderly suicide  is,

however,  a  multi-faceted issue  requiring  a  concerted

effort  among the various stakeholders, including  health

and social service providers, families and the police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the interventions for potential suicide

cases are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, counselling which is currently provided by

Family  Service  Centres,  SAGE Counselling  Centre,  the

Samaritans of Singapore and hospitals;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, specialised treatment, including

counselling for psychiatric cases, which is available  at

the Institute of Mental Health (IMH); and,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, hospice care which provides for the

management of patients, including the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>

elderly,  with serious illnesses where curative treatment

is  no  longer  appropriate.  Some examples  include  the

Dover Park Hospice and St Joseph's Home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these intervention services, I would like

to  share  with  Members the efforts of  an  inter-agency

workgroup  -  the Golden Life Workgroup - which  aims  to

raise public awareness about elderly suicide and the help

available,   and  to  equip  professionals  with   better

intervention  measures to prevent such suicides.   Formed

in early 2000, this workgroup is chaired by the Singapore

Action Group of Elders (SAGE), with representatives  from

various   organisations,  including  MCDS,  Ministry   of

Health,   Institute  of  Mental  Health,  Samaritans   of

Singapore,  National  Council  of  Social  Service,  NTUC

Eldercare,   hospitals,  hospices  and   family   service

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, the workgroup has produced a training

manual for professionals, such as social workers, nurses,

doctors  and  the  police, on the management  of  elderly

suicide.   The  workgroup also conducts regular  training

workshops  for professionals and caregivers to help  them

to  identify  suicidal tendencies among the  elderly  and

render  necessary assistance.  To raise public  awareness

on  elderly  suicide,  the workgroup  launched  a  public

education campaign in September last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also funds Befriending Services, Day

Care and Neighbourhood Link programmes which help relieve

the  social  isolation that can contribute to depression.

Such  programmes  serve  to  keep  the  elderly  actively

engaged.   They also refer the elderly and their families

to other appropriate services as necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS also plans to promote expertise in gero-counselling, a specialised form of counselling which is

more sensitive to the physical and psycho-social needs of

the  elderly.   For  a  start, we will  sponsor  suitable

candidates  for  overseas training at the Masters  level.

MCDS  will also work with interested agencies to  develop

local gero-counselling training programmes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has various schemes to help

the elderly have easy access to health care.  In addition

to  the  subsidies at polyclinics and specialist clinics,

the  Ministry  of  Health has put in  place  a  range  of

schemes  to  provide  affordable  health  care  for   the

elderly, including Eldershield.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, elderly suicide prevention is complex

and  the  collaborative efforts of all  stakeholders  are

necessary to prevent elderly suicide.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he

agrees  with  me that many suicides are as  a  result  of

depression,   and  that  depression  is   treatable   and

preventable?  Therefore, will the Minister facilitate the

early  detection of depression by all those  involved  in

the  community through promoting their awareness and  the

early  referral of depression by people such as community

caregivers, family service providers and VWO providers in

order to reduce the suicidal rate?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, as I mentioned

in  my  reply, two reasons were cited during  the  study.

One of them was, of course, depression, and we have taken

that  into  account.   The  Golden  Life  Workgroup   has

produced a training manual which will be used by all  the

caregivers to help them identify potential suicide cases.

Once  they  have been identified, they can  be  referred,

depending  on  their level, either to counselling  or  to

various specialists at the Institute of Mental Health, to

provide  counselling and whatever curative care  that  is

needed.   So  I would like to assure the Member  that  we

have such a system in place at this point in time.  A lot

would depend on the cooperation of the various centres to

use  the  manual that we have given to them, and also  to

use  the  skills  that we have imparted to  some  of  the

counsellors  who  have been trained under  this  training

programme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether it is

correct  to say that more men committed suicide  compared

to women, and that the ratio is 60:40?  Has the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>

Minister done any study to ascertain the reason for  this

fact,  so that better preventive care can be implemented?

If  the answer is yes, could he share with this House the

outcome  of this study and the pro-active actions  to  be

taken to improve the suicide rate?  If the answer is  no,

could the Minister undertake such a study?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, the Member is

right.   Just  to  give Members a feel  of  the  figures,

according  to  the  data that we have obtained  from  the

Subordinate   Courts,  more  men  than   women   actually

committed  suicide between 1995 and 2001 - roughly  above

56%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not we have been successful in

preventing it, this we will have to see over time, as  we

have  already put the system in place.  We are monitoring

the  figures  very closely, and these figures  have  come

from the Subordinate Courts.  A lot would depend upon the

training conducted by the Golden Life Workgroup, together

with the various community service providers, in how they

can  successfully  identify  those  potential  cases  and

prevent them from taking place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our basic philosophy is that if we can continue to

engage  the elderly within the community, that  would  be

one  of  the best steps forward, as that will bring  them

into contact with community service providers through the

neighbourhood links, the activity centres, which can then

help  to  identify potential cases and  suicides  can  be

prevented.  I do not have a study to say that in the last

five  years this programme has been effective.   We  have

just  put  in  place some of these preventive programmes.

We  have to look over time how best the various community

service  providers  will  adopt some  of  these  training

measures that we have imparted to them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister

did not get my question.  I did not ask on the success of

his  programme.  I asked whether any study had been  done

to  ascertain why more men committed suicide compared  to

women, and whether anything can be done about it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, no study has

been  done to ascertain why there is a difference between

men and women.  Perhaps, given the data that we have,  we

can  actually look back again. But, more often than  not,

we  have  to look into the case file, because  this  goes

back to the Coroner, who would investigate the case.   It

is  always very difficult because we have, in a sense, to

do  some  inference  looking at  the  background  of  the

particular  person - what may have happened  -  and  make

informed  judgments.   But a study can  be  conducted  to

understand some of those reasons.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, the Minister

mentioned poor health and depression.  To what extent  do

financial  problems  play a role?  I  ask  this  question

because,  for  many  of them, to depend  on  children  is

tough.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, this is based

on  the  data  that we have collected between  1995-2001.

Again, as I have said earlier, this is dependent upon the

Coroner's findings with the police reports.  On financial

problems,  about 30 suicides between 1995-2001 have  been

attributed  to financial problems.  Sir, it would  appear

that it is not one of the largest factors.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamed Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamed Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, can the Minister

tell  us  what is the living arrangement of these elderly

who  have committed suicide?  I am just wondering whether

they  were  living with the family members  and  if  they

were,  my understanding is, if we talk about poor  health

and  depression,  many of them do have  foreign  domestic

helpers taking care of their physical needs.  So, to what

extent  are these foreign domestic helpers being assisted

or  being prepared to help in identifying at-risk  groups

so that these suicides could be prevented?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, based upon the

2001  data, out of the 74 elderly who committed  suicide,

76%  were  married and 81% were living with at least  one

other family member.  I do not have the information  with

respect to whether the maids have been trained.   But  at

this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>

point in time, there is no such programme.

<div align="center"><b>HDB CAR PARKS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Construction cost and car park charges)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a) what is the composition of the  cost  of

construction of HDB car parks and (b) what are the  years

of depreciation used by his Ministry in the consideration

of the car park charges.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the construction cost of

HDB  car parks consists of land and building costs.   The

building  cost can be sub-divided into the  cost  of  the

foundation;  the  cost of the car park  structure  itself

which  includes the car park decks, ramps and staircases.

Other  costs under the building cost would include things

like  the  cost  of the drainage system,  the  water  and

electrical supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These land and building costs of the car parks are

depreciated  over their estimated useful  life  based  on

standard   accounting  practices.   The  land   cost   is

depreciated  over  99 years, while the building  cost  is

depreciated over 60 years.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may I ask the Minister of State how many years have

the  HDB  Car Park Section been suffering from a deficit?

What  is the difference between a structural deficit  and

an  operating deficit?  I would also like to know whether

there  is any change in accounting basis over these years

in the Car Park Section.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only

have the figures going back to 1995 and I can assure  the

House  that  it has been in a deficit entirely  over  the

period  except in Financial Year 1997.  On Dr Teo's  next

question, I am not sure whether I understood his question

on the difference between a structural deficit and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>

an  operating deficit.  The deficit that I have  referred

to, in the case of the car parks, is an operating deficit

which takes into account the building cost, land cost and

these  costs are then depreciated over their useful life.

There is no separate sinking fund and other accounts.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

looking at the Annual Report 2001, there is this cost  of

interest  expense  which constitutes  about  42%  of  the

operating  expenditure.   Could  we  know  what  is  this

interest expense?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this, in a

way,  is related to Dr Teo's point.  When we put  up  car

parks, we have to purchase land and incur costs to  build

those car parks.  The money to buy land and to build  car

parks does not come out of nowhere.  In the case of  HDB,

it  borrows money in order to fund the purchase  of  land

and  building costs.  In order to sustain the borrowings,

this will attract interest and will have to be repaid.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of

State has not answered my question on whether or not  HDB

has  changed the accounting basis for car parks over  the

years.  In the Budget Debate, the Minister mentioned that

HDB had a structural deficit of $100 million last year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said

that, the figures that I have from 1995 to last year show

that there has been a deficit throughout except in FY 97.

As  far  as I know, from 1995 to now, there has  been  no

change  in  accounting basis.  When we tell Members  that

the  deficit has been growing in the last six years, this

is  a  real deficit and it is an operating deficit.   The

quantum for last year was $115,288,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister of State has mentioned the construction cost  of

the  car  parks.  There are two parts, ie,  the  building

cost and land cost.  Can he tell us exactly what are  the

figures for the land cost and building cost for a typical

multi-storey  car park and, secondly,  for  an  open  car

park?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I presume

Mr  Low  is asking for a breakdown.  For a typical multi-storey  car  park, the land cost would be  slightly  less

than half of the total cost.  Let me give you an example.

My  Minister,  at the last Budget Debate, said  that  the

total  cost  of an equivalent car park lot  in  a  multi-storey car park is about $20,000.  The land cost would be

about  $9,000  and the construction cost would  be  about

$11,000.   In the case of surface car parks, my  Minister

has  given the figure of $11,200.  In the case of surface

car  parks, obviously the bulk of the cost would be  land

cost.   There  would  still  be  some  construction  cost

because  we need to surface the lots and do the  markings

and  all  that.  There would still be some costs involved

but  obviously,  because we do  not  have  to  put  up  a

foundation  for the whole structure, the  cost  would  be

lower in that respect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister of State, in an

earlier  answer, said that the depreciation was based  on

accounting  practice, ie, the life of the car park  would

last  for  as long as the flat, ie, 99 years.   But  what

would  happen  to  the  remaining  car  park  after   the

depreciation?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> I mentioned that the cost

of  land  is  depreciated over 99 years and the  cost  of

building  is  depreciated  over  60  years.   These   are

accounting  norms  based on what we think  would  be  the

estimated useful life of that building or land.   In  the

case  of land, it is quite clear because the entire  land

is sold on a 99-year lease.  In the case of a car park, I

think  we can argue whether it should be 60 years  or  50

years,  or so on.  But the point is this is what we  feel

and  the  accountants feel is a reasonable target  to  be

depreciated  over.  I would like to caution Members  that

if we were to increase the rate of depreciation, it would

increase the cost on an annual basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Transport if his Ministry will consider introducing  8  - 10  seater  mini-buses to ply within HDB estates  with  a

standard  boarding fare, similar in concept to co-sharing

in taxis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, as I mentioned in Parliament previously, my Ministry

is  open  to  the  idea of allowing more  competition  in

feeder services in HDB towns.  I have also proposed  that

this be tried out on a pilot basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PTC will be formulating the terms and conditions for

such  services.   In principle, any operator  wishing  to

provide feeder services must be prepared to compete on an

equal footing with the existing operators. To ensure that

all residents are well served, the operator would need to

meet   certain  service  standards,  including  providing

comprehensive coverage and running a full-day service, in

the same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>

way  as the incumbents are required to do.  He will  have

to  provide scheduled services on fixed routes and at  an

acceptable frequency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be up to the operator to decide what

capacity  of buses he wishes to use, provided  that  they

comply  with environmental, safety and quality  standards

specified by the PTC and LTA.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Would the Minister give

this House the assurance that SBS would not withdraw  its

services, especially for some of the routes which are not

lucrative ones, when we allow these private bus operators

to operate in competition with SBS?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the PTC is still looking

into the operating framework and once they are ready, MPs

will be told accordingly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, must it be on a similar footing as the

current  operators?   Can it not be  on  a  complementary

service   where  you  have  an  additional  service   for

residents who actually want the comfort and efficiency to

reach their house faster?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the present bus operators

are   required  to  comply  with  the  universal  service

obligation,  ie, they are obliged to provide the  service

for  the  whole day, from 6 am to 12 midnight.  They  are

obliged to provide the service to all geographical  areas

covered  by  the service agreement.  And,  therefore,  we

will  not  allow other operators to cherry-pick,  ie,  to

serve only the areas that are profitable or to serve only

during   the   peak  periods  when  the  passengers   are

plentiful.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if taxis

are  allowed  to  cover the same areas as  the  transport

actually be picked up from the MRT station to go to their

house?

<div align="center"><h4>PERSONAL EXPLANATION</h4></div>

<br>2.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  make  a  personal

statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 9th July 2002, during the debate on the

motion on public transport fares, I said the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister had

told  the House in May, when making his Budget statement,

that  the PTC had decided that there would be no need  to

raise fares next year as a result of the increase in GST.

Little  did  we  know  that what the  PTC  meant  was  no

increase next year did not mean no increase this year!  I

do  not  know if you would call this twisted or  sardonic

humour, but I think it is, almost for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>

sure, not funny at all to Singaporeans.  How sure are  we

that,  next  year, we will not be told again by  the  PTC

that  never  mind the increase in GST, but operating  and

maintenance  costs have gone up again  and  therefore  we

have to have another increase in fares."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after my speech, the Minister for Transport

rose  on  a point of clarification.  He pointed out  that

the  Deputy  Prime Minister had not given the  impression

that the PTC would not be approving any bus fare increase

this  year.  Mr Yeo quoted what the Deputy Prime Minister

had actually said in his Budget statement, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Public Transport Council (PTC) is currently

evaluating  proposals  from the  transport  operators  to

revise fares.  PTC is only considering revisions to catch

up with operating and maintenance cost increases over the

past year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo went on to quote the DPM:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The public transport operators have raised with the

PTC  the  issue  of  the GST increase next  year.   After

considering their views, with the likely increase in  GST

to  5% and the proposed cut in the corporate income  tax,

the  PTC has decided that there is no need to raise fares

next year as a result of the GST increase.  The transport

operators have accepted this decision."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my immediate response to Mr Yeo and the House

was  that I did not think that I had given the impression

that  the DPM deliberately set out to mislead the  House.

I have since checked the verbatim report of my speech.  I

now  accept that it suggests that the DPM and the PTC had

deliberately misled the House and Singaporeans.  Also, in

referring to the DPM's speech, I did not inform the House

that  the  DPM had said that the PTC was then  evaluating

proposals from the transport operators to revise fares to

catch up with operating and maintenance cost increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to apologise to the

House,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the  PTC   for

suggesting that the DPM and PTC had misled the House  and

Singaporeans.  There is no basis for that suggestion, and

I  withdraw  it.  I would also like to apologise  to  the

House  for  not  pointing out that the DPM  had  actually

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>Finance)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Economic

Review  Committee (ERC) unveiled its first major  set  of

recommendations  covering taxation in  April  this  year.

The Government responded to these measures with a package

of  tax  reforms  in  the  Budget Statement,  which  will

enhance  our  competitiveness, and  help  us  to  attract

foreign investment and talent to Singapore, thus creating

jobs and generating wealth for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major set of proposals from the ERC is on

the   Central  Provident  Fund  (CPF),  which   the   ERC

Subcommittee on Taxation, the CPF system, Wages and  Land

released  on  15th July.  The Sub-Committee reviewed  the

existing  CPF  framework,  and proposed  changes  to  the

system  to  achieve  a better balance between  retirement

security  and  home  ownership, and to  make  the  labour

market  more  flexible, in order to maintain  and  create

more  jobs especially for vulnerable groups such as lower

income and older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel with the work of the ERC, the Ministry

of  National Development has been studying how to  inject

greater  flexibility into the public housing market.   In

particular,  MND  has studied devolving  to  the  private

sector  those  functions of the Housing  and  Development

Board  (HDB)  which  extend beyond the Government's  core

responsibility of providing affordable basic housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I shall present the Government's response to

the ERC's CPF recommendations, and outline the changes to

CPF rules arising from MND's review of HDB.

<br><br><i>Key Principles of the CPF System</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first deal with the ERC recommendations. The

Government accepts all the ERC recommendations.  The  CPF

is the cornerstone of our social security system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>

It  is  based  on  individual  responsibility  and  self-funding,  and has served us well for many years,  helping

Singaporeans  save  for their own  retirement.   The  CPF

system remains fundamentally sound.  However, our society

is  changing.  Singaporeans are living longer.  More  are

remaining single or having fewer children.  Increasingly,

Singaporeans have to depend more on CPF savings  than  on

their  children for their retirement needs.  We now  must

update  the  CPF  framework,  to  adapt  to  a  different

economic  and social environment, and to pre-empt  future

problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to the CPF system will be based on the

following principles adopted by the ERC:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF should focus on three key objectives:

retirement  expenditure, healthcare and  home  ownership.

These form the core elements of financial security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, CPF should aim to meet these three needs at

a  basic  level.  Beyond  this basic  level,  individuals

should   rely   on   their  own   private   savings   and

arrangements. For a compulsory scheme like the CPF to  go

beyond  providing for basic needs would add  rigidity  to

the economy and be onerous to both employers and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the CPF should be designed for the broad

majority  of Singaporeans, between the 10th to  the  80th

percentiles of the income spectrum.  Those below the 10th

percentile  cannot rely on CPF alone for their retirement

needs,  and  would need the help of other social  support

schemes.  Those above the 80th percentile should be  well

able to look after their own financial affairs, including

planning for their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, changes to the CPF system should be

gradual,   because  many  people  have   made   long-term

commitments based on the current framework and they  need

time to adjust to any policy changes.

<br><br><i>Minimum Sum</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, the Government has been progressively

increasing the Minimum Sum by $5,000 each year.  We  will

reach

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>

the  target Minimum Sum of $80,000, including up to  half

in  a  property  pledge, by July 2003.  This  will  allow

members to draw a monthly income of about $450 to support

a modest standard of living upon retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees with the ERC that the CPF

Minimum Sum should not remain frozen at $80,000.  As  the

economy grows and wages increase, Singaporeans will  have

higher  expectations of what is adequate for their  basic

retirement  needs.  The current Minimum Sum will  not  be

enough  and  will need to be revised upwards  over  time.

The  Government will decide on the next target amount for

the  Minimum  Sum and the schedule for reaching  the  new

target,  after the Minimum Sum has reached  $80,000  next

year.

<br><br><i>Special Account</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution rates to the Special Account are

currently 4% for members aged 35 and below, 6% for  those

aged between 35-45, and also 6% for those aged between 45-55  (or,  in brief, 4-6-6).  The Government has announced

that these contribution rates will be increased to 4%, 6%

and  8%  respectively  (4-6-8), as  we  restore  the  CPF

contribution rate to 40%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at 4-6-8, however, only half of all CPF members

can  achieve the Minimum Sum of $80,000 by  age  55.   To

help  more  Singaporeans  attain  the  Minimum  Sum,  the

Government  has  decided to adopt the ERC's  proposal  to

raise  the  target CPF contribution rates to the  Special

Account  by  1  percentage point across the  various  age

groups,  from  4-6-8 to 5-7-9.  This will enable  another

10%  of  CPF members to attain the Minimum Sum of $80,000

by age 55.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in the Special Account contribution

rates  to 5-7-9 will be effected as we restore the  total

CPF contribution rate to 40%.

<br><br><i>Investment in Private Pension Plans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help CPF members build up more cash savings, the

ERC has proposed that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>

the  Government  facilitate the  provision  of  low-cost,

privately-managed pension plans to CPF members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees that we should encourage

Singaporeans  to  invest  in  privately-managed   pension

plans.  Experience in other countries, such as the US and

Australia,  has  shown that, over  the  long  term,  well

diversified  pension  plans  offer  better  returns  than

keeping the money in cash, earning short-term savings  or

fixed deposit rates of interest.  Such pension plans also

offer  superior returns at lower risk and cost,  compared

to  members investing the money themselves in  shares  or

unit trusts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, private pension plans are not yet available

in  the local market.  This is partly because the current

regulatory  rules for the CPF Investment  Scheme  (CPFIS)

are not conducive to such plans.  More fundamentally,  it

will  take  time for Singaporeans to adopt a  mindset  of

investing  their  retirement  savings  with  a  long-term

perspective,  instead of using CPF  funds  to  trade  for

short-term gains, eg, on the stock market.  Based on  the

experience  of other countries, the process  of  changing

this   public  mindset  may  take  a  decade  or  longer.

Nevertheless, we should start now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the Government will facilitate

investment  in  private pension plans, as  an  additional

option   under  the  CPFIS  framework.   We  will  review

existing CPFIS rules to improve the viability of  pension

plans,  and  encourage members to consider pension  plans

seriously as an investment option.  However, CPF  members

must   remember  that  higher  risk  accompanies   higher

returns,  and  that they are ultimately  responsible  for

their own investment decisions.

<br><br><i>Special Account Interest Rate</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all CPF members will be ready to enrol in

private  pension  plans,  or  take  on  other  investment

options  already  available under the CPFIS.   Those  who

prefer  to can continue to leave their savings  with  the

CPF   Board.   The  Special  Account  interest  rate   is

currently  pegged to a premium of 11/2 percentage  points

over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>

the Ordinary Account interest rate.  The ERC has proposed

pegging  the  Special Account interest  rate  to  a  more

appropriate long-term interest rate, such as the yield on

long-term Government bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees with this recommendation in

principle.    It  will  study  the  matter  further,   to

determine the appropriate benchmark interest rate to use,

and the time of implementation.

<br><br><i>Salary Cap</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also agrees with the ERC's

recommendations  to  lower the  salary  ceiling  for  CPF

contributions from a monthly salary of $6,000 to $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with the principle that CPF should

focus on catering to basic needs of the population in the

10th to the 80th percentiles of the income spectrum.  CPF

members  who  earn  more than $5,000 a  month  fall  well

within the top 20th percentile in terms of income.  There

is  no  need  to  require  them to  set  aside  the  same

proportion of their incomes in compulsory CPF savings  as

others  with lower incomes.  Lowering the salary  ceiling

for CPF contributions to $5,000 will achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service will also rationalise the salary

ceiling  of  the public sector with that of  the  private

sector.   The salary ceilings for non-pensionable  public

officers are currently $7,000 for employer contributions,

and  $6,000  for employee contributions. We  will  reduce

both ceilings to $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensionable public officers currently have higher

CPF    salary   ceilings,   at   $9,333   for    employer

contributions, and $8,000 for employee contributions.  As

their  CPF  contribution rates are lower  than  for  non-pensionable  officers,  their salary  ceilings  were  set

higher so that their maximum contribution in dollar terms

would  equal that of non-pensionable officers.  With  the

ceilings  for  non-pensionable officers brought  down  to

$5,000,  we will lower both the employer's and employee's

ceilings for pensionable officers to $6,667.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution ceiling to the Supplementary

Retirement  Scheme (SRS) will be correspondingly  reduced

to $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason the CPF salary ceiling had been set at a

high  level was to effectively lower the personal  income

tax  burden  on higher income groups, because  compulsory

CPF contributions are tax deductible.  At a time when top

personal  income tax rates were high, this was especially

relevant for employees, whose incomes tended to  be  more

fully    declared   than   self-employed   workers    and

professionals.  However, over the years we  have  lowered

income  tax  rates  significantly.   We  have  now   also

implemented the SRS scheme, which enables Singaporeans to

set aside additional voluntary savings for retirement, in

tax sheltered SRS accounts.  There is therefore no longer

a need for such a high CPF ceiling.  Singaporeans who are

concerned that the lower CPF contribution will result  in

them  paying  more income taxes, and who have  not  taken

full  advantage of the SRS scheme, may wish to do  so  to

lower their tax liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will be implemented as we restore the

CPF contribution rate to 40%.

<br><br><i>Income Floor</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, employees who earn less than $200 a month

do  not  contribute to CPF.  Contribution rates are  then

phased in on a sliding scale from 5% for wages at $200 to

a full rate of 20% for wages at $363 and above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This income floor of $200 was set in 1955 when CPF

was  first  introduced.  In the half century since  then,

wages   have  gone  up  many  fold,  but  we   have   not

correspondingly   adjusted   the   income   floor.    The

Government  therefore  agrees to the  ERC's  proposal  to

raise  the  income floor for employee's CPF  contribution

from between $200 and $363 to between $500 and $750.  The

vast majority of workers in full-time jobs earn more than

$750  per  month.   This  change will  therefore  benefit

especially  part-time  workers.  We  hope  that  it  will

encourage more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>

people  who  are  presently  not  working,  for  example,

housewives, to take up part-time work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change will take effect for salaries earned

from 1st October 2002.

<br><br><i>Older Workers Aged 50-55</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the unemployment rate for older workers

aged  50-55  is  still  lower  at  4.6%.   However,  this

situation  is  unlikely  to  persist.   As  our   economy

upgrades   and   restructures,  structural  unemployment,

especially among older workers, will increasingly  become

a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a foretaste of this in the recent economic

downturn.   Older workers who were retrenched faced  much

greater  difficulty  securing re-employment  compared  to

younger workers.  A survey of workers who were retrenched

in  the 4th quarter of last year found that as at the end

of  March  this  year, among those aged  50-55,  the  re-employment  rate  was 41%, compared  to  an  overall  re-employment  rate of 50%.  Older workers also took  longer

to  find  new  jobs.  The median duration of unemployment

for workers aged 50-55 was 21 weeks, compared to 13 weeks

for  workers across all age groups.  On top of this,  73%

of  workers  between 50-55 years accepted pay  cuts  when

they were re-employed, compared to an overall average  of

59%  who  accepted  pay cuts.  The pay  cuts  were  often

substantial.   In other words, for this  group  of  older

workers, the re-employment rate was lower.  It took  them

longer to find new jobs, and when they did find new jobs,

they had to accept deeper pay cuts.  And more of them had

to accept pay cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem of structural unemployment will not go

away.   The  fundamental reason is that our workers  will

continue  to face strong and increasing competition  both

from  educated workers in developed countries,  and  from

the  lower  cost workers of countries like China.   Older

workers will be most at risk, because they are on average

less well educated than younger ones.  This too will be a

persistent issue, because although workers aged 40-44 are

better educated than those aged

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>

50-54, workers aged 30-34 are better educated still  than

those  aged  40-44.  In 10 years' time, when the  workers

who are now in their 40s reach their 50s, they will still

be  less  well-educated than workers  who  are  10  years

younger than them, and therefore will be at greater  risk

of becoming structurally unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our older workers are also more vulnerable because

our  seniority-based pay system pushes  wages  up  beyond

what  their  skills and productivity can  justify.   When

older  workers lose their jobs, they tend to have  higher

wage expectations, which makes it more difficult for them

to  find  re-employment.  The 40% CPF  contribution  rate

exacerbates   these  problems,  because  it   discourages

employers  from  taking  on  older  workers,   and   also

discourages  older workers from working for  lower  take-home pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the first problem of older workers being

less  skilled,  we  must  continue  to  push  for  skills

upgrading.   Last  year,  the  Government  introduced   a

comprehensive set of programmes to upgrade the skills  of

older  workers.  These included enhanced support for  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP), and the People-for-Job   Traineeship  Programme  (PJTP)  which  incentivises

employers to hire older workers by defraying part of  the

associated training costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programmes were originally intended to last

for  12  months,  to  tide older workers  over  immediate

difficulties  in the economic downturn.   The  Government

will  now extend the enhanced support to the SRP, as well

as the PJTP, for an additional year until November 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also improve the PJTP for older workers.

Under  the  PJTP,  workers receive wage support  for  six

months, amounting to 50% of their wages.  For workers who

are more than 50 years old, we will extend this period of

wage  support to nine months, but at a lower support rate

of 25% for the additional three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the second problem of the seniority-based

wage system, we need to inject greater flexibility in the

wage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>

system.   The  effort to promote flexi-wages has  yielded

results,  but  it will take many years to  complete.   We

need to complement it by lowering the burden of statutory

charges  on  wages  for this vulnerable  group  of  older

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government therefore agrees with the

recommendations  of  the ERC to keep the  employer's  CPF

contribution rate for workers aged 50-55 at  the  current

16%.  We will also progressively lower the employee's CPF

contribution rate for workers aged 50-55 from 20% to 16%,

as  we  restore  the CPF contribution  rate.   This  will

increase  the  take-home pay for these workers  and  help

them to meet their financial commitments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this structural change, the total CPF

contribution rate for workers aged 50-55 will  be  32%  - 16%  from  employers and 16% from employees.  This  is  a

meaningful  step-down from the 40% full  rate  for  those

aged  below 50, to 32% for those aged 50-55, to  20%  for

those  aged 55-60.  It will encourage employers  to  keep

their older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should clarify that the non-restoration only

applies to workers aged 50-55, and not to workers aged 55

and  above.  Those workers above 55 will have  their  CPF

contribution  rate  restored together with  workers  aged

below 50, to their pre-1998 levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of the total CPF contribution rate to

32% for workers aged 50-55 addresses a foreseeable future

problem.  However, for workers already in this age  group

who  currently have jobs, the non-restoration of employer

contributions  may  cause them  to  lose  out,  at  least

relative  to  other workers whose employer  contributions

will be restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some older workers have also expressed concern that

the  non-restoration will affect their ability to service

their  mortgages.   Younger workers  will  have  time  to

adjust, and are unlikely to run into such problems by the

time they reach

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>

50-55.   But  workers  now in this  age  group  may  face

mortgage payment shortfalls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are valid concerns, although the difficulties

are transitional ones.  We can, and we should, take steps

to  buffer  their impact on workers who are currently  in

this  age group, especially as the restructuring  of  CPF

rates  for  the  older workers deals with  a  medium-term

rather   than   an   immediate  problem   of   structural

unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help workers facing mortgage shortfalls due to

the  non-restoration, the Government will allow these CPF

members  to continue to draw on their Special Account  to

pay  their  mortgages for a longer period  of  time.   We

already introduced such a scheme when we cut the CPF rate

in 1998.  We will now extend its duration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recommended by the ERC, we encourage employers to

pass  on  part of their cost savings to deserving workers

in this age group, as the CPF is restored for the others.

Employers  can  do so through the variable  component  of

wages,  such  as  bonuses  or  other  variable  payments,

depending  on the circumstances of each company  and  the

contribution of each worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service will take the lead and implement a

Transitional  CPF  Top-Up  Component  (TCTC)  for   civil

servants aged 50-55.  Officers, who are aged 50-55 on the

dates  when the CPF is restored for others, will receive,

in their TCTC, part of what they would have got had their

CPF too been restored.  PSD will announce details of this

scheme in due course.

<br><br><i>Valuation Limits on Bank Mortgages</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home ownership for Singaporeans continues to be a

fundamental policy objective of the Government.  When the

Residential Properties Scheme first started in 1981,  CPF

withdrawals  for private property purchases were  subject

to a Valuation Limit of 80% of the value of the property.

But   over   the   years,   this  Valuation   Limit   was

progressively liberalised.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>

current  limits  on  the  use of CPF  funds  to  purchase

properties are very lax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF withdrawals for housing can reach imprudent

levels  if  they are not appropriately capped.   This  is

especially  so  because  we  allow  CPF  savings  to   be

withdrawn  not just to pay for the property  itself,  but

also to service the interest payments on a mortgage loan,

which  are  in  fact  not  investments,  but  a  form  of

consumption.   Furthermore,  the  property  market   goes

through cycles.  If property prices fall, part of the CPF

savings  that members have put into the property  may  be

lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF withdrawals for housing are meant as a form of

investment.   Indeed,  for most Singaporeans,  the  house

they  live  in is their single most important investment.

The  amount of CPF committed to a house should  therefore

bear  an  appropriate  relation  to  the  value  of   the

property.     The    Government   accepts    the    ERC's

recommendation  to set a withdrawal limit  equivalent  to

150%   of  the  valuation  of  the  property.   The  150%

Valuation Limit will take effect for options to  purchase

residential  properties which are  entered  into,  on  or

after 1st September 2002.  The limit will be brought down

gradually to 120% of the value of the property, over five

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 150%, the Valuation Limit should not have

significant  impact on most home buyers on  the  property

market.   Even  at 120%, a typical CPF member  can  still

service  a  25-year mortgage fully with his  CPF  for  19

years.  There is thus a long lead-time for CPF members to

plan  their  finances properly so that they can  continue

servicing   the   mortgage  in  cash  after   their   CPF

withdrawals have reached the Valuation Limit,  or  factor

in  some cash co-payment along the way and spread out the

usage   of  their  CPF.   However,  by  instituting   the

Valuation Limit now, we establish the important principle

that  the amount of CPF used to buy a house must  not  be

excessive in relation to its value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Valuation Limit will not apply to those who

purchase HDB flats using subsidised mortgages.   It  will

also not apply to options to purchase entered into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>

before  1st  September 2002 and existing mortgage  loans,

except where these are refinanced.

<br><br><i>Other ERC Recommendations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has made other recommendations which I have

not  covered today.  These include exploring ways to help

home-owners    monetise   their   assets,   strengthening

provisions for healthcare needs, and devolving  CPF-based

insurance  schemes to the private sector.  The Government

agrees  with  these  recommendations in  principle.   The

relevant  agencies are studying them further to  see  how

best to implement them.

<br><br><i>Banks Origination of Market Rate HDB Loans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now explain the changes

arising  from  MND's study to devolve some  non-core  HDB

functions   to   the  private  sector.    These   include

transferring  future  HDB market  rate  loans  to  banks,

changes to the CPF charge on a private property which  is

mortgaged,   and   changes  to   the   cash   downpayment

requirement on mortgages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the banks origination of market rate HDB

loans.   The  Government has a responsibility to  provide

affordable  basic housing in the form of  subsidised  HDB

flats to Singaporeans, and to enable as many citizens  as

possible to own their own homes.  It also helps HDB  home

owners to upgrade to bigger flats, as their families grow

and   they  accumulate  sufficient  savings.   HDB   will

continue  to provide subsidised mortgage loans for  first

time flat buyers and second time buyers who are upgrading

from smaller flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all Singaporeans who buy HDB flats fall

into  these categories.  For example, they may be  buying

an  HDB  flat for a third time, or they may be  making  a

lateral  transfer from one 4-room flat to another.   Some

may  even  own private properties and may be  buying  HDB

flats  to  live  in  while they rent  out  their  private

properties.  Other HDB buyers do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>

qualify for HDB subsidies at all.  For example, they  may

be  permanent esidents, or they may have high incomes and

be  buying a flat on the resale market.  HDB allows  such

purchases,  but  it  does not consider  them  as  falling

within  its  core objective of promoting  universal  home

ownership amongst Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of this distinction, HDB makes two

types  of  loans  to the two groups of buyers.   For  the

first  group, HDB has subsidised loans which  are  a  key

instrument to promote home ownership.  The interest  rate

for  such  loans is pegged at the CPF interest rate  plus

0.1%.   For the second group, who do not fall within  the

basic housing safety net, HDB provides market rate loans.

The  interest  rate  is pegged to the  rate  DBS  charges

former Credit POSB mortgagors.  In 2001, about 37% of all

loans  provided by HDB, amounting to $3.2  billion,  were

market rate loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has been looking into whether certain functions

that  go beyond its core activities can be better handled

by the private sector, so that it can better focus on its

basic  objective  of  providing  affordable  housing  for

Singaporeans.   Arising from this review, the  Government

has  decided that, from 1st January 2003, HDB will  cease

to  grant  market  rate  loans.  Instead  banks  will  be

allowed  to  provide loans to flat buyers  at  commercial

rates  and  on  commercial terms.  HDB flat  buyers  will

benefit from more choices, and can take advantage of  the

many  competitive housing loan packages  offered  by  the

banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing HDB market rate mortgagors can continue

their  existing mortgages provided by HDB.   However,  if

they  wish  to  refinance their  loans  with  the  banks,

subject to the new Valuation Limit, they can do so.

<br><br><i>CPF Second Charge on Bank Loans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the CPF second charge on bank loans.

Currently, for mortgage loans made by HDB, HDB has  first

charge, followed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>

by  CPF Board, which has second charge.  This means  that

if   the   buyer  defaults  on  his  mortgage,  and   HDB

repossesses his property, then HDB will deduct the amount

that  the  mortgagor owes HDB before paying  any  balance

back  to the mortgagor's CPF account, or to the mortgagor

himself in cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change to this arrangement when

banks  start selling mortgages for HDB flats, as  far  as

the mortgagors are concerned.  The banks will merely step

into  the  shoes  of HDB, and have first  charge  on  the

mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mortgages on private properties, however, where

the banks have been the lenders, the arrangement has thus

far  been  the opposite.  In the event of a loan default,

the  CPF Board assumes priority charge over the mortgaged

property,  ahead of the banks.  This means that,  in  the

event  of borrower default, the banks are unable to  make

effective use of the mortgaged property to mitigate their

losses.  This is because proceeds from the liquidation of

the  property will first have to be used to repay the CPF

Board, ie, to repay the borrower's own CPF account.   And

as  the loan matures and more of it is repaid through CPF

withdrawals, the Board's claims increase correspondingly.

The  banks are entitled to a diminishing residual  amount

after  the  money  has been returned to the  buyers'  CPF

account.   Hence, the more loan is repaid with  CPF,  the

less satisfactory the bank's collateral position becomes.

This is not sound for the banking system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far this has not posed any major problems,

because  over the past decades, the property  market  has

risen  steadily and strongly, especially in the  80s  and

early  90s  when  the economy was booming.   So  long  as

property values continued to appreciate and few borrowers

defaulted  on  their mortgages, there  was  less  concern

about  the value of the collateral, and whether banks  or

the CPF ranked first in a default.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the property market is unlikely to be

as buoyant as in the 80s

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>

or  early  90s.   This  sharpens  the  latent  prudential

concerns over the existing charge arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second problem with the current arrangement is

that  borrowers  who run into difficulty will  have  less

incentive to continue servicing their loans because their

own  CPF  money will be less at risk than their  creditor

banks'  claim on the property.  This can also  contribute

to  imprudent  investments in  properties.   CPF  members

investing  in  shares or other financial assets  have  no

such  buffer  available, and take on the  full  risks  of

their investment decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not prudent to allow the present

unsatisfactory arrangements to continue.  The  Government

has  thus decided to reverse the charge position  of  CPF

Board   and  banks  for  mortgage  loans  originated   by

financial  institutions regulated  by  MAS.   The  banks'

principal will now rank ahead of CPF savings withdrawn to

purchase  the  property  and to  service  the  loan.   On

interest  due,  CPF Board and the banks  will  rank  pari

passu.   This change will align the treatment for private

loans   with  HDB  loans.   It  will  apply  to  property

purchases where the options to purchase are entered  into

on  or  after 1st September 2002, and also apply  to  all

existing loans that are refinanced after this date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reversal of charge position will also apply to

the   use  of  CPF  savings  for  the  purchase  of  non-residential    properties   under   the   Non-Residential

Properties Scheme.

<br><br><i>10% Cash Downpayment on Housing Loans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, bank financing for private property is

subject  to  a  cap  of 80% of the property  value.   The

remaining 20% downpayment must be paid in cash and serves

as  a buffer for the banks.  CPF money cannot be used for

this  downpayment, because the CPF Board ranks  ahead  of

the  bank  in its claim, and so, in a default, CPF  money

does not provide any buffer to the bank.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the lending bank will rank ahead of the CPF

Board,  CPF  can  be  used for part of  the  downpayment.

However, it would not be prudent to do away with the cash

requirement  altogether,  because  this  could  encourage

excessive property speculation.  We have thus decided  to

allow   10%  of  the  downpayment  for  private  property

purchase  to  be paid out of CPF savings.  The  remaining

10%  will  still  have to be paid in cash.   The  maximum

quantum  of  bank financing will stay at 80% of  property

value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rules will apply to CPF Board applications

for  private  property  purchases where  the  options  to

purchase  were  entered into, on or after  1st  September

2002.   Properties  for  which the  options  were  signed

before 1st September 2002 will not be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB loans, whether subsidised or not, currently have

no  cash  downpayment requirement.  HDB flat  buyers  are

allowed   to  use  CPF  savings  to  pay  the  full   20%

downpayment,  because  for HDB loans,  CPF's  claim  rank

second  to  HDB's claim.  When market rate HDB loans  are

transferred  to  bank  origination,  we  will   initially

preserve this arrangement.  But for the longer term,  the

rules  for  these bank-originated mortgages on HDB  flats

should  be  aligned with the rules for  private  property

mortgages.   We  will phase in the 10%  cash  downpayment

requirement  for  bank mortgages on HDB flats  gradually,

over five years.

<br><br><i>No Change to Subsidised HDB Loans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, no change to subsidised HDB loans. I would

like  to emphasise that HDB subsidised loans will not  be

affected  in  any  way by these changes.   They  will  be

subject  neither  to  the  new Valuation  Limit  for  CPF

withdrawal, nor the 10% cash downpayment requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Clerk to

distribute  a summary of the changes to Members  so  that

they could see at a glance the whole picture.  [Copies of

Summary of the changes distributed to hon. Members.]

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, implementation of many of these

measures  is  pegged  to  the  restoration  of  the   CPF

contribution  rate to 40%.  When and how long  this  will

take  depends on the state of our economy, as well as  on

developments in the region and around the world.   It  is

therefore   difficult  to  commit  to  a   schedule   for

restoration, though it remains the Government's intention

to  restore  the  rate as quickly as  conditions  permit.

Barring   unforeseen  circumstances,  we  can  reasonably

expect to restore CPF contribution fully to 40% in two to

four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, his

ERC  Sub-committee members and the members of the CPF and

Wages Working Group for their hard work in coming up with

the CPF proposals.  During their deliberations, they have

solicited  a  wide range of views - from workers,  labour

unions, employers and financial institutions.  They  have

produced  a balanced package of proposals which preserves

the existing strengths of the CPF system and, at the same

time,  makes  the necessary adjustments  to  improve  the

financial  security  of individual Singaporeans,  and  to

enhance   labour  market  flexibility.   These   changes,

together  with the changes to the use of CPF for property

purchases and the divestment of HDB market rate loans  to

banks, will pre-empt significant long-term problems,  and

contribute to Singapore's overall economic resilience and

competitiveness.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

that  some Members would like to debate my Statement  and

in accordance with Standing Order No. 42, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament do now adjourn."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

CPF changes by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>

ERC  is  arguably  a  set  of recommendations  that  most

significantly affect Singaporeans.  This is evidently  so

as  there  are 2.9 million CPF members with  balances  of

almost  $94 billion with the Board.  Changes to  the  CPF

will fundamentally influence the way we save and the  way

we invest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a labour MP, the most common reaction I have come

across in the last one week is why did the Government cut

the   CPF   for  older  workers.   Will  the  lower   CPF

contribution  for  workers aged  50-55,  amounting  to  a

saving for employers, make much of a difference in making

these workers employable?  I can understand their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is not a magic potion, or as in the Chinese

saying, "wan ling dan" that "yao dao bing chu".  Perhaps,

this is a key problem of the image of the CPF system.  It

has  been so successful in the past and it covers so many

areas  that  people have come to regard it  as  something

that  can fix all problems straightaway.  Not so in  this

case.  Lowering the older workers' CPF contribution alone

does not automatically make them employable.  However, we

believe  it  will certainly make it more  attractive  for

employers to retain and hire them.  We have to view  this

from  a  broader  perspective.  It is part  of  the  many

schemes  that the Government is putting in place to  help

older workers stay employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the proposed CPF adjustments, there are many

schemes  to  help  enhance  the  employability  of  older

workers.  For example, older workers get higher levels of

funding support under the Skills Redevelopment Programme.

I  am  happy  that  DPM has announced the  People-for-Job

Traineeship   Programme  launched  by  the  Ministry   of

Manpower last year will be extended for one more year  to

help older workers and workers above 40 years old to make

career transitions by providing wage support.  I am  also

very happy that the Government is now also extending this

support  from six months to nine months for  workers  who

are aged 50 and above.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some respects, we should look at the CPF

changes  as  a  catalyst as we restructure the  Singapore

economy.  The key task of the ERC must not be lost in our

debate.   The  CPF  recommendations  cannot  be  seen  in

isolation.  In my view, the CPF changes will spur greater

labour  market  reforms  and increase  wage  flexibility.

These will make Singapore more attractive for investment.

Thus, more jobs can then be created.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I strongly urge employers not to treat the CPF

changes as just a wage cut or cost-saving exercise.  They

cannot  and must not implement the changes in  a  blanket

manner.   I  am glad that the Government, as an employer,

has  decided  to  take the lead.  For  deserving  workers

above 50 years old who face the CPF cut, employers in the

private  sector can also plough back the CPF  savings  in

monthly variable components (MVC) or bonus (AVC).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the ERC proposed that the monthly

income floor range for employees' CPF contributions  also

be  raised, from the current range of $200-$363 to  $500-$750.   This  increases  the take-home  pay  for  workers

earning below $750.  This will help them better meet  the

current  needs  and encourage more to take  up  part-time

jobs,  and  also encourage workers to enter the workforce

again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part-time workers are a group that deserves

more   attention  and  help.   We  know  that   employers

generally do not provide benefits for part-time  workers.

For  example,  they  do  not get much  medical  or  leave

benefits.  This should not be the case.  Employers should

seriously  consider to pro-rate the benefits  to  further

attract more people to take up part-time jobs with  these

CPF changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the ERC recommendations, I hope the

Government  can  consider doing more to  help  the  lower

income  workers,  as they work hard  to  earn  an  honest

living  and  more  can be done to help  them.   When  the

Government  implements  CPF top-ups  or  distributes  New

Singapore  Shares  in  future, the older  and  the  lower

income workers must take top priority.  This will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>

make  up  for the reductions in their CPF as a result  of

the ERC recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am encouraged that the ERC

studied  the  issues thoroughly in its report.   The  key

recommendations go some way in enhancing the CPF members'

retirement  savings, especially with the 1%  increase  to

the  Special Account.  The cap on housing loans will also

preserve more CPF savings for members, as otherwise  they

may be eroded through housing loan interest payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the ERC has recommended that the

Minimum Sum be raised beyond $80,000, it did not say what

the new target should be, when it should be achieved,  or

what provisions should be put in place to ensure that  it

is  met.  We all know that the Minimum Sum is not enough.

But  what  exactly  will  be  enough?   We  need  to  let

Singaporeans know so that they can work towards it.   The

ERC could have been clearer in this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Committee of Supply debate, I asked the

Minister for Manpower how was the Minimum Sum derived and

whether it was enough.  In reply, the Minister said  that

the  Minimum Sum is literally the bare minimum.   Sir,  I

hope the Government can give a clearer indication of what

the  new  target  should be when  it  considers  the  CPF

recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I would like to ask is whether we

should   also   set  regular  adjustments   to   Medisave

contributions, like the Minimum Sum, to be raised further

in  future.  Many workers do worry that their Medisave is

not  enough.  Let me share a feedback I received  from  a

union leader.  She told me:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is timely to refocus CPF and bring the focus

back  to retirement savings and medical.  My parents  had

very  little  in  their  Medisave  and,  when  they  were

hospitalised in recent years, they had to draw on all the

children's Medisave.  Fortunately, there were four of  us

for  them to draw on.  A relative of mine had all his CPF

Medisave savings wiped out over a few years when his  dad

suffered  from cancer.  The old man had minimum  Medisave

and he has only one child."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we need to also ensure that people have

enough savings for their medical needs in future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the changes, but I

urge  the Government to continue to explore more ways  to

help  the  older and lower income workers  who  will  see

reductions  in  their CPF accounts.  How will  they  meet

their retirement needs?  What is the level of CPF Minimum

Sum which is adequate for their retirement?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers too must do more. They cannot let

the  Government  just carry the can.  They  can  actually

play  a  much  more  constructive role in  helping  their

employees  adjust  to the changes, particularly  for  the

older workers.  To the employer, I would like to say:  do

not  discriminate against older workers but  continue  to

reward them fairly for their contributions.  Redesign the

jobs  to increase productivity and employability  of  the

older workers and attract part-timers.  At the end of the

day,  CPF  changes  will introduce wage flexibility  that

will make companies more competitive.  With the employers

taking a more active role, this would mean more jobs  for

workers, together with all the changes recommended.  Only

in  this  way can we achieve a win-win outcome  for  both

employers and employees.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support

of  the  CPF  changes  as proposed by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the changes to the CPF system are gradual,

it  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction  in  preparing

Singaporeans   for   the  future.   Faced   with   global

competition and an aging society, Singaporeans must adopt

more prudent and longer term financial planning for their

present and retirement needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF system has benefited many Singaporeans over

the years.  It has helped many Singaporeans to own homes,

pay part of their medical expenses, and also to have some

cash savings for retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With medical advancements and better healthcare, the

life  span  of Singaporeans will increase, thus requiring

more Singaporeans to plan for a longer retirement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>

period.  This, coupled with the increasing health  costs,

will  pose an undue financial burden on retirees, if they

do   not   have   sufficient  savings  after  retirement.

Therefore,  it is necessary for us to fine-tune  our  CPF

system  to  help  Singaporeans  better  cope  with  these

changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to highlight the impact of the proposed

changes  on  CPF  members,  employers  and  the  property

market.

<br><br><i>Impact on CPF members</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed increase of CPF contribution rate to

the   Special  Account  and  the  lowering  of  the   CPF

withdrawal limit for housing will ensure adequacy of  CPF

funds   for   retirement  needs.   These  measures   will

encourage  CPF members to be more prudent when purchasing

property  not using HDB subsidised loans.  It  will  also

indirectly   provide  some  barriers  for  existing   HDB

homeowners  to upgrade into private property.   As  such,

future   Singapore   generations   may   encounter   some

difficulty to own private homes.  But these measures  are

necessary  to  address the "asset  rich  and  cash  poor"

situation faced by some retirees today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed increase in the contribution rate to

Medisave  and  the  devolution of MediShield  to  private

insurers  will  also  increase the affordability  of  CPF

members on their healthcare expenses in future.   But  we

need  to  be cautious in adopting a healthcare  insurance

approach,  as many countries have experienced  abuses  of

such  a  system resulting in drastic increases in  health

costs.

<br><br><i>Impact on employers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes have minimum impact in helping

to  reduce  business costs in Singapore.  A 4% saving  in

employers' CPF contribution for employees aged between 50

and  55  years  old will not provide much  incentive  for

employers  to employ these workers.  Instead, this  group

of workers will lose out 4% of their CPF savings for five

years.  I do not think employers will modify their salary

system to specifically provide variable wage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>

component  for  these workers.  In fact,  many  of  these

older  workers may not be in a position to  bargain  with

their  employers,  thus  literally  losing  4%  of  their

salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Government to allow

businesses  to  adopt market practices  to  reward  their

workers aged between 50 and 55.  These workers should  be

rewarded based on their work performance.  We should  not

cap  their  CPF  contributions  and  cause  the  existing

110,000  workers in this age group to suffer a  pay  cut.

We   should  instead  make  workers  and  employers  both

understand  that  they have to give and take,  to  ensure

that  their companies can survive and continue to provide

employment.  The CPF contribution should not be used as a

tool to save jobs or reduce business cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help older workers to remain employable, we

should continue to encourage skills upgrading and provide

incentives for companies to employ older workers, such as

providing tax rebates.

<br><br><i>Impact on property market</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed 150% limit on CPF withdrawal for

housing  will not have significant impact on the property

market,  except  for  HDB upgraders.   The  reduction  of

salary ceiling for CPF contribution from $6,000 to $5,000

will  affect  the mortgage payment plan for home  buyers,

especially dual income HDB families which plan to upgrade

to  private property.  The 150% CPF withdrawal limit will

also  curb  demand for private housing as these potential

home  buyers are usually in their 40s and 50s,  and  will

not  be able to secure a 25-year bank loan.  It will also

affect  the  repayment  ability of  home  buyers  in  the

distant future, especially when interest rate increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in the longer term, the proposed CPF changes

will  lower  the attractiveness of property as  an  asset

class  for  investors.   This  will  provide  more  price

stability  in the property market, thus avoiding  drastic

property  price  fluctuations,  which  have  caused  some

bankruptcies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed CPF changes will provide a more

balanced  portfolio  for CPF members  to  better  prepare

themselves for their future needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the CPF changes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  support the proposed changes to the  CPF  scheme

which will help enhance the retirement needs, as well  as

increase  wage flexibility, particularly to  improve  the

employability of older and less skilled workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes will bring some pain but I think they

are necessary in order that we are able to meet the tough

challenges in this increasingly competitive and uncertain

globalised  world.  Sir, I am assured  that  the  changes

will  be introduced at a gradual pace and this would give

sufficient  time  to the members to make adjustments  and

adapt to the new system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the change to raise the monthly salary floor

range  for employees' contribution to $500-$750 from  the

current range of $200-$363, I believe this will encourage

more  job-seekers  to consider jobs, including  part-time

work, as this will enable them to bring home more pay  to

meet  their  immediate  needs.  However,  there  is  this

concern  that  with this change, low-income workers  will

not be able to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>

save  more for their Medisave and retirement needs.  Sir,

I  hope  that  the  Government will,  in  times  of  good

budgetary  surpluses, help to provide more to this  group

of  workers so that they can have more savings  in  their

CPF, eg, the CPF Top-up scheme or Medisave scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, we should also help these

workers to upgrade their skills so that they can move  on

to  better  paying jobs and make better contributions  to

their  CPF.   As regards the lower employer  contribution

rate for workers aged 50 to 55, from 20% to 16% when  the

CPF contribution rate is restored to 40%, I would like to

urge  employers  to  follow the Government's  example  to

provide  a CPF Top-Up which can form part of the  monthly

variable component.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, to help members to enhance their return

on their CPF balances, I am happy to hear of the proposal

to  increase  the  interest paid to the  Special  Account

balances.  This is to be based on more appropriate  long-term interest rates like the interest rates of Government

bonds  and  also  to make a change to the CPF  Investment

Scheme  to  enable  members to  participate  in  low-cost

privately  managed  pension  funds.   Sir,  in  order  to

encourage  members  to make use of  these  facilities,  a

public education programme is necessary.  I would like to

suggest  that  CPF  embark on an education  programme  to

educate members on the pension scheme, explaining clearly

the downside risks as well as the benefits of the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC has stated its concern that the present

Minimum  Sum  Scheme  will  not  be  sufficient  for  the

majority  of retirees and, therefore, we need to increase

it  beyond the current target of $80,000.  I support this

proposal  to  increase  the  Minimum  Sum  Scheme  beyond

$80,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the DPM whether there is any way

whereby we can incorporate the Minimum Sum Scheme  within

the proposed pension plan scheme for CPF members.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for housing needs, the liberal usage of the

CPF  funds over the years has unfortunately led  to  many

CPF  members  becoming  "asset-rich  and  cash  poor"  at

retirement.   Housing ownership has  contributed  to  our

stability  as  it  has  given our  citizens  a  stake  in

Singapore's  success.  But I think there is this  problem

that  the  property that they purchased cannot be  easily

converted  into  cash, particularly in a period  of  slow

property  market  and  this has  prevented  members  from

converting their properties into cash when they need it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to explore means to enable house owners

to monetise their properties.  I understand that the Land

Working  Group of the Sub-committee is looking into  some

recommendations.   I would like to see  what  they  would

recommend because I think there is an urgent need to help

those who have put money into properties to convert  them

into cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish  to join in the debate on this  Ministerial

Statement on the CPF and related changes, so as  to  seek

some  clarifications  and  ask  for  flexibility  on  the

implementation of the proposed CPF changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I start, I wish to declare my interest that I

am  an Executive Director in an organisation involved  in

property  business and I personally am a property  owner.

In  fact, I am going to reach 50 years very soon and will

be  much  affected  by the new CPF changes.   Hence,  the

changes I request for will have an impact on the property

market.   However, the points I intend to raise  are  for

the general interest of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to support the various changes announced

by  the  Deputy  Prime Minister.  The  DPM  has  actually

announced  many  changes and some are most  welcome.   In

particular, I would like to express my happiness  in  the

new   rule  to  allow  10%  of  the  purchase  price  for

downpayment to be paid out of the CPF account.   This  is

indeed a welcome move to enable younger employees to  buy

their first property.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand and accept the proposed changes to

the CPF regime such that there will be less risk of over-exposure  of the people, especially for older people,  to

property  investments.  However, there are some  concerns

of  the public on the lowering of the salary ceiling from

$6,000 to $5,000 and that these new rules will lessen the

ability of the affected persons to service their existing

housing loans using CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise four suggestions or

questions with the DPM.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I wish to make is that the proposed

capping  of the total amount that can be used  from  CPF,

from  160% to 150% in the first year, and eventually down

to  120%  of the property value in the fifth year,  means

that  employees  who have loans reaching this  limit  but

they  could  have  some more balance  in  their  own  CPF

Ordinary  Account,  are  forced  to  use  their  personal

savings  or  cash to continue servicing existing  housing

loans.  This may pose, in some cases, severe financial or

cash  flow  problems  to  these  affected  persons.    In

addition,  in terms of investment options open  to  them,

this  new  rule  will  mean that they  now  have  limited

options that can be used in the CPF funds for properties,

and  may  have to switch to investing in other  forms  of

investments, like shares, securities, and other forms  of

financial instruments.  This could create rigidity in the

investment  options open to them.  We  have  read  recent

reports from banks and financial advisers that properties

have  historically been proven to be  a  better  form  of

investment  compared to shares and  equities.   This  new

rule  may  impose  more constraints on  the  CPF  account

holders to put their money into good investments such  as

properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is to request the DPM to

consider  allowing loans for one owner-occupied  property

per  person to be exempted from the total valuation  cap.

The  limit is 150%, reducing to 120% in five years' time,

which  would be imposed on CPF withdrawals to be used  to

service such loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept is practicable and workable, which is

the same principle applied

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>

in  the  case of property tax concession where  a  person

with  one  owner-occupied property is  allowed  to  enjoy

property  tax  concession.  I believe this suggestion  or

flexibility  of  not  imposing a valuation  cap  will  be

beneficial to all Singaporeans, and lessen their concerns

about  their  ability  to service existing  or  even  new

housing  loans, provided it is a owner-occupied property.

I  sincerely feel that this suggestion is very useful and

meaningful, and urge the DPM to think about it seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to turn to two

questions  that I have filed for Oral Answer.   If  these

two questions are adequately addressed and replied to  by

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister, I may consider  withdrawing

these two questions to be tabled for a future sitting  of

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first suggestion is not to lower the CPF

contribution  rates of older workers aged  between  50-55

who  have  existing housing loans.  I  wish  to  ask  the

Deputy Prime Minister to consider this idea, because  the

older  workers  aged  between 50-55  may  be  faced  with

heavier reliance on their cash or personal finances  when

their CPF contribution rates are reduced or not restored.

This  concession  will also mitigate  their  concerns  of

their ability to continue servicing their existing loans.

If  their  CPF  contribution rates are  lower  (as  their

employer's  contribution will be lower),  therefore  they

cannot service their loans based on the present plans for

their existing loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I particularly like the idea of the

Transitional CPF Component Top-up (TCTC) which  has  been

proposed for civil servants aged between 50-55.  I  think

this idea is a very enlightened and laudable move.  May I

urge  the  Government  to request private  companies  and

employers who are doing well to consider having a similar

scheme  for  their employees aged between  50-55.   Their

workers  will at least enjoy the benefit of the CPF  top-up, for companies that are doing well, and not face lower

CPF contributions into their accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last suggestion is to request the DPM to

consider not applying the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>

proposed  CPF  changes to owners of  existing  properties

when they re-finance loans on their properties.  A person

may  continue  to own an existing property  but  wish  to

refinance the terms of the loan with the existing bankers

or  new  bankers,  so  as  to enjoy  the  declining  loan

interest  rates.   If  the new  rules  kick  in  when  an

existing property is refinanced, then the owners may find

that   they   are   restricted  from   using   more   CPF

contributions  once  the  limit  on  the  withdrawals  is

reached based on the new rules.  This may result  in  the

owners  being  unable to enjoy lower  interest  rates  if

their banks are imposing higher interest rates than other

bankers.   I am sure that DPM does not wish to  see  this

rigidity that creates a constraint on our people to enjoy

lower housing loan rates, particularly for refinancing of

existing  properties.  Therefore, refinancing of existing

properties should not be deemed as new loans when the new

CPF  rules  are  applicable.  If this is not  allowed,  I

would like to ask the DPM to explain to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the proposed CPF changes may be

received favourably by the Government for the benefit  of

all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to express my appreciation to members of  the

ERC  Sub-Committee for their recommendations on the  CPF.

I  support  the recommendations and would like  to  offer

some  suggestions  on the greater use of  private  sector

pension scheme as an extended form of the CPF scheme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since its introduction in the 50s, there have

been many refinements in the CPF scheme, influencing home

ownership,    healthcare,   family   protection,    asset

enhancement  and  retirement needs.   And  in  the  years

ahead,   we  could  anticipate  further  refinements   or

changes,  as  Singapore  faces significant  economic  and

social   challenges,  from  an  increasingly  competitive

global environment, maturing economy and a rapidly ageing

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report has alluded to the need for the

Government  to  facilitate  the  provision  of   low-cost

privately  managed  pension plans to CPF  members  as  an

additional  option under the CPF framework.   I  strongly

support   this  move  and  would  like  to   offer   some

suggestions.   This move towards private  sector  pension

plans  will  allow  greater flexibility  for  members  to

invest and secure their own retirement.  And to make this

possible, I would urge the Government to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) consider allowing members to use their CPF

money to subscribe to private-sector pension schemes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) review some of our existing policies and rules

that  may  pose as obstacles or impediments towards  this

goal,  ie,  our  tax regime, to make it  more  "friendly"

towards annuities, pensions and so on; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) consider an "opt-out" option under the Minimum

Sum Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision and contribution by CPF members

towards  private-sector pension funds  would  reduce  the

burden  and dependence on a centralised state-run pension

fund.  I suggest the Government give more recognition and

accord  more flexibility on the part of those individuals

who are able to look after their own financial affairs in

contributing   to  private-sector  pension   schemes   or

insurance plans.  This will enable the CPF scheme  to  be

seen  for  what  it truly is  -  to be a  facilitator  to

members' retirement needs, rather than a burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with this and to encourage individuals to

take greater responsibility for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>

their  own financial planning retirement needs,  I  would

suggest the Government look into introducing an "opt-out"

option  for the Minimum Sum for individuals who are  able

to  demonstrate  that  they  have  set  aside  more  than

adequate  resources  for their retirement  needs  through

private-sector pension funds or insurance policies.   And

this  is  not limited to just those who are ranked  above

the 80th percentile of the wage earners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having a rising Minimum Sum annually beyond

$80,000  from June next year in line with benchmark  wage

growth  presents  a  number  of  problems.   Firstly,  it

creates an illusion for the less financially astute  that

since  the  number is Government mandated,  it  would  be

sufficient for their needs, which is not necessarily  so.

As  a  consequence, it may discourage members from taking

greater personal responsibility over their own retirement

needs,   and  not  make  additional  provisions   through

investing  or  saving  on private pensions  or  insurance

plans.  This may lead to disappointment in the future as,

indeed,  the Sub-Committee has rightly pointed  out  that

the Minimum Sum may not go far enough to cater for rising

standards of living in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, by requiring members to set aside a

Minimum  Sum in addition to what is available from  their

own retirement planning under private pension schemes  or

plans  produces an inefficient allocation  of  resources.

Singaporeans  who  are able would  be  better  placed  to

manage  the Minimum Sum on their own and would  otherwise

be  restricted from using these funds for more productive

investments or entrepreneurial activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is also inefficient to members who are

able  to  plan  ahead  to have an  increasing  amount  of

savings  tied  down in their Special Accounts  that  have

limited  investment  options under  the  current  scheme.

Allowing  a  greater  use  of  the  Special  Account   to

contribute  efficiently to private  pension  plans  would

both  benefit  the  individuals as well  as  promote  the

development   and   growth  of  the  financial   services

industry,  in  particular, the insurance  companies,  for

which the pooling of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>

more  CPF  assets  could  render  them  more  viable  and

efficient as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as with any changes that will affect the lives

of  Singaporeans,  there  will  be  some  resistance  and

unhappiness over some of the recommendations that  affect

different individuals.  However, it is reassuring to hear

from the Government that it will implement the changes as

recommended progressively over a period of time,  and  as

painlessly  as  possible.  I am also  certain  that  with

greater information and more publicity, Singaporeans will

understand the need for such changes, and recognise  that

CPF's  strong  emphasis on individual  responsibility  to

secure their retirement expenditure, healthcare and  home

ownership is in their long-term interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Sir, I support the recommendations of

the  ERC  Sub-Committee and would urge the Government  to

further  enhance the flexibility of the  CPF  scheme,  in

particular,  to give greater recognition and  leeway  for

members  to  subscribe to private-sector pension  schemes

using  their  CPF money and to withdraw the  Minimum  Sum

amount  should  they  be  able to  show  that  they  have

invested in private pension funds on their own, and  have

pensions  or insurance plan resources in excess  of  this

Minimum Sum.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed changes to our

CPF  system,  as announced by DPM Lee in his  Ministerial

Statement, are very prudent and timely.  I would like  to

share my views on three aspects of the proposals for  the

consideration of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, on the lowering of withdrawal limit

for   housing.  I  think  this  is  a  wise  move.   Many

Singaporeans  are investing a significant part  of  their

income  and  savings in housing, some have even  exceeded

their means.  Lowering the withdrawal limit on their  CPF

savings  will  help to prevent Singaporeans  from  buying

properties beyond their means, thereby ensuring that they

would  not  be  caught  in a crunch  when  faced  with  a

financial crisis. On the other hand, as this package

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>

will be implemented gradually in stages, it will give the

people  time to make the necessary adjustment,  and  will

not  create  too much of adverse impact on  the  property

market.  I am sure the property developers will  heave  a

sigh   of   relief.   However,  when  this  lowering   of

withdrawal limit has eventually come into full effect, it

will  inevitably  affect the property purchasers  because

once  they  have  reached the ceiling of  the  withdrawal

limit  from their CPF savings, they will have to pay  the

remaining instalments in cash.  To ease the situation,  I

have two suggestions to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think we should consider allowing the

purchasers  to  have their properties revalued.   If  the

property  price has gone up, they should  be  allowed  to

raise their withdrawal limit.  Secondly, so long as  they

have the Minimum Sum set aside in their CPF account, they

should continue to be allowed to use their CPF to pay for

their  housing. After all, they are allowed to use  their

surplus amount in their accounts to invest in shares. Why

do  we  not allow them to use the money to pay for  their

own   property  instead?  I think this  will  enable  the

people  to  have  more flexibillity in using   their  CPF

savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me talk about raising of the income floor

for  CPF  contribution.  Now that  we  have  many  people

unemployed,   I  think  we  should  help  these   people,

especially  those  in  the lower income  group.  We  must

encourage  them  to be more flexible and adaptable.  They

should  be  persuaded to take up whatever jobs  that  are

available  to them, even if the pay does not  meet  their

expectations.   They  should take these  jobs  first,  at

least  for  the time being. By raising the income  floor,

they would enjoy higher take-home pay and be more willing

to accept lower paid jobs, or  part-time jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to talk about the reduction of

CPF contribution rates for those aged between 50-55.   On

this  recommendation, I must say I am somewhat  relieved.

At  least, those aged between 40-50 are not affected,  at

least for the time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>

being.   However, I feel that we should be more  cautious

in  implementing  this  recommendation.   First,  the   4

percentage point difference may not be enough to make the

employers  decide to employ the older workers.   DPM  Lee

has   also  said  that  from  experience,  most  of   the

retrenched older workers had to accept a lower pay.  From

experience  they have to accept at least  20%  less  than

what they were drawing before their retrenchment, if they

were  to  get  back into the labour market.   Recruitment

decisions  are based on many factors and salary  is  just

one  of them. The employers would normally want to employ

older   workers  for  their  experience,   maturity   and

reliability. On the other hand, if the candidate is found

to  be  unsuitable  for the job, the 4  percentage  point

difference is not likely to swing the employer's decision

in favour of the older candidate for the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I agree with DPM Lee that it would not be

fair  to  those  who  had  already  made  sacrifices  and

accepted a wage cut so as to retain their jobs during the

crisis. During the bad time, they were told and they  had

accepted  a  pay cut to help the company stay  viable  in

order  to  secure  their job. Now  that  the  economy  is

showing  signs  of recovery, they are slapped  with  a  4

percentage  point  reduction in  their  CPF  contribution

rate.  This  is  a double blow to them.   These  are  the

workers who were more responsive to the Government's call

to  "bite  the bullet", yet we are now cutting their  pay

again. This is unfair to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I feel that this will send a wrong signal

that  the  Government  endorses  the  belief  that  older

workers are less productive and should therefore be  paid

less.  I understand that this recommendation is aimed  at

countering  the  seniority-based  wage  system.  But,  by

reducing  the  older workers' CPF contribution  rate,  it

will  unintentionally further entrench   this  seniority-based  salary system. We may send the wrong message  that

seniority-based system is all right since the  Government

is  finding ways and means to compensate for it.  I  feel

that  we  should instead encourage  employers to adopt  a

flexible wage system and reward the workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>

according to their productivity and contribution. In this

way, we will be more competitive, and be in a position to

compete  globally.  Of course, this is no easy task,  but

we  should not shy away from the important task and  take

the easy way out. We should give  the employers more time

to accept and implement  the flexible wage system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the Government to

reconsider this move to reduce the CPF contribution  rate

for  workers  between the ages of 50  and  55.   If  this

scheme  has  to  be implemented, then I  would  urge  the

Government  to persuade employers to convert the  4%  CPF

savings into a variable component of the worker's monthly

salary.  If  any particular worker's performance  is  not

satisfactory, this variable component can then be removed

by  his  employer.  This will ensure that  the  employers

will not take advantage of Government policy to force the

workers  who had already suffered a round of pay  cut  to

take  another cut in terms of CPF contribution.  In  this

regard,  I  am  pleased to note that the  Government  has

taken  the lead to compensate the affected civil servants

in this age group with the TCTC scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's determination to improve our economic

situation  through fundamental changes in our CPF  system

is evident to all. However, the changes to the CPF system

must be carried out in parallel with the creation of  job

opportunities. If there are no new job opportunities, the

unemployment  situation will not  improve.   I  think  we

should,  on  one hand, improve the employability  of  our

workers  and,  on the other hand, strive to attract  more

foreign investments so as to create more jobs. This  way,

we   can  then  solve  our  unemployment  problem  at   a

fundamental level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Ministerial Statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

it takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze 3-feet  deep.  Indeed, the problem of CPF has been  brewing

for quite some time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the economic recession in 1986, the

Workers'  Party  suggested that the Government conduct  a

comprehensive  review  of the CPF  system,  in  order  to

establish a balance between the people's needs in  saving

for  retirement,  housing and medical; and  the  need  in

maintaining  our  economic  competitiveness.    We   also

cautioned  about  the people spending their  CPF  savings

excessively  on the purchase of properties.  However,  in

the  1990s, following a steady economic recovery and  the

PAP Government relaxing its regulations pertaining to the

purchase  of property, particularly its tactic  of  using

"assets  enhancement"  as a trump card  for  winning  the

General  Election, it brought about a mad rush among  the

people  to upgrade their HDB flats or to purchase private

properties.  As a result, CPF members are in a  situation

today,  which the Economic Review Committee describes  as

"asset rich but cash poor".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike in 1986, this time round we are also

pressurised by the problem of unemployment brought  about

by  our transition into a new economy, using the means of

reducing  the CPF contribution rate in order  to  enhance

the  employability of people in a certain age  group  has

become yet another goal of the CPF system, on top of  its

original  aims of ensuring that people have the means  to

pay  for  their  housing loan and medical  expenses;  and

maintaining enough cash for their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to resolve the tension brought about by these

conflicting  demands?  Faced with an  economic  situation

where  high growth and high employment rate are no  more,

and   a  future  where  the  population  is  aging,   the

cumulative  pressure from all these phenomena  makes  the

problem  tougher than that in the post-1986  years.  Will

the  recommendations of the ERC be effective?  Do we need

to have another economic review committee to review again

soon  after?  We  shall wait and see.   While  the  world

economy  is  changing rapidly and the  Asian  economy  is

shifting its focus, we have to monitor their impact on us

closely.   I  am  even  doubtful  that  the  current  CPF

contribution  rate of 40% can be sustained  in  the  long

run.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this situation, we are particularly concerned

with  the  impact  brought about by the  Economic  Review

Committee's  recommendations on  the  middle  and  lower-income people.  In principle, we agree with this increase

in  income  floor for contribution to CPF,  so  that  the

lower-income people will have more take-home pay to  meet

their  daily expenses.  However, we need to look  at  all

the ERC's recommendations in total.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, the Government has accepted the

Committee's  recommendation to raise  GST,  and  MAS  has

predicted  that with the increase in GST, inflation  will

also go up.  If these two recommendations are implemented

simultaneously, the lower-income people will be  back  to

square  one  again  and still have problems  making  ends

meet,  once  the  Government  withdraws  all  the  offset

packages  that come with the GST increase.  At  the  same

time,  they will lose some savings in their CPF accounts.

The Committee holds the view that the lower-income people

cannot  depend  on  their CPF alone for their  retirement

needs.  We  therefore  feel that  the  Government  should

clearly  indicate  how it is going to help  these  people

deal with their problems after retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those middle-income people, whose salary is

between $5,000 and $6,000, ERC's proposal of reducing the

contributing  income ceiling will lead to a reduction  in

their  income as a whole.  Not only will they  have  less

CPF,  the  extra  cash in their take-home  pay  would  be

subjected  to  income  tax  too.   Although  they   could

transfer  the  cash  back to CPF under the  Supplementary

Retirement  Scheme,  the pressure brought  about  by  the

increase in GST may make it difficult for them to do  so.

After  all  the  Government has said, for  those  with  a

higher income, the impact of GST increase on them will be

greater.  The ERC has also recommended that people invest

these  extra cash on financial products that give  higher

returns.   This will inevitably attract higher risk  and,

of  course, the additional cash that they have will  mean

more income tax to pay.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>

Compared  to the current arrangement, whether the  people

will  gain  under the new recommendation  is  a  question

mark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people who are from the above group and whose

age  falls  within 50 and 55, they will be the  ones  who

suffer  most.   The ERC commented that  their  wages  are

higher than the younger workers on the same job based  on

the  current seniority-based system, and this makes  them

vulnerable to retrenchment.  The ERC claims that reducing

the CPF rate for people in this age group would help them

to  have better job security, and encourage employers  to

retain or employ these older workers.  I do not know  how

the  Committee has come to this conclusion.  There is  no

mention  in  the report of how the ERC has come  to  this

conclusion.  We have also doubts as to how the effects of

this recommendation could be evaluated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aim of the ERC is to reform the so-called

seniority-based  wage  system  so  as  to   enhance   the

flexibility  of  the wage system and, at the  same  time,

narrow the gap of CPF rates between the pre-55 and  post-55  members, then  it would involve not only those in the

50  to 55 age group.  From the present situation and  the

discussion  prior  to the release of the recommendations,

it  would  appear that the Government's target of  reform

will  not be confined to the 50 to 55 age group. What  is

the Government's long-term policy on this?  Should it not

spell  it  out  clearly to the people so as to  alleviate

their anxiety, and be better prepared psychologically?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has emphasised that this recommendation is

not aimed at reducing the cost of the employers.  So they

encourage  the employers to pay back the savings  to  the

employees  through other means.  But will  the  employers

really  do that in reality?  Unless the Government  makes

rules  to  compel  them to do so, this recommendation  is

indeed  helping  the  employers save  on  their  manpower

expenses.   To   those  workers  in   this   age   group,

particularly  those who are relatively  stable  in  their

job,  this  recommendation weakens  their  capability  to

service

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>

their  housing  loans and to have more  money  for  their

retirement.   Does this not run contrary to the  original

intention of the  ERC?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Special Account, the ERC's

recommendation  is to adjust the contribution  rate  from

the  4-6-6%  formula  to the 5-7-9%  formula,  after  the

employers'  CPF  contribution rates are  fully  restored.

Did  the  ERC  consider  other combinations?   As  people

younger  than  45  are more flexible in reacting  to  the

changes  in the labour market, and contributing  more  to

the  CPF,  should  we  not increase the  Special  Account

contribution rate for those below 45?  At the same  time,

can  we not separate the group of 45 to 55 into two  sub-groups  of  45-49 and 50-55?  This will bring us  to  the

formula  of 7-9-9-6%.  Please refer to the table which  I

have  circulated to hon. Members.  In this way, we  could

caution  the  young people to be more prudent  in  making

their  decision to purchase property and also to  prepare

for  their  retirement much earlier.   Furthermore,  when

they  have reached the age of 50 and above, not only will

their  CPF contribution rate be reduced, they will,  more

often  than  not, have other commitments and  needs,  for

example,  paying for their children's university  tuition

fees  through CPF, the proposed 7-9-9-6 formula will help

them be better prepared to service their housing loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has also recommended that the

Government  provide  more means for the  people  to  sell

their  property for cash for their retirement.  We  agree

with this recommendation.  However, the Committee has not

mentioned  how  to  solve the housing  problem  of  these

people  who  have  sold  their  properties.   The  Senior

Citizens  Apartment Scheme introduced by HDB may  be  one

option.  However, this is only confined to purchases  and

not  rentals.  The Government should consider appropriate

policy measure to provide rental housing option for those

who do not wish to purchase a house.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the enhancement of the returns on CPF funds,

we  agree  with the Committee's view. Under  the  present

practice of individual investment arrangement, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>

is  difficult  for the investors to attain  the  original

target  of  the  CPF  investment scheme.  The  Government

should  consider allowing CPF members to  participate  in

other  private pension investment plans, or perhaps   set

up  a  national pension investment scheme so that we  can

pool  our  resources, reduce costs and  to  increase  the

returns on investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we agree with this principle of

gradual  adjustment  to  the  CPF  structure  so  as   to

strengthen  the CPF's original function of providing  for

life  after retirement.  The people should be more  self-reliant,  and start preparing for their retirement  early

in  life. However, in a tough economic environment, there

are  bound to be some Singaporeans who are unable to make

ends  meet after retirement.  I would like to remind  the

Government  that it has to look after the livelihood  and

welfare of this group of people.  This is, after all, the

responsibility of the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for this opportunity to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee has recommended many changes

to  the  CPF system.  The ground sees most of the changes

as  reasonable  and necessary.  This is  because  workers

understand that it is important to have enough money  set

aside for old age, medical expenses and housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, the proposal to increase the

percentage  contributions  to Medisave  and  the  Special

Account  as CPF is progressively restored did  not  raise

any  eyebrows.  Workers know that this is done for  their

sake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tightening of the limits on the use of

CPF  funds for mortgage payments, workers have  seen  for

themselves, in recent years, how the property market  has

sagged.   They know now that pouring more and more  money

into  property purchases, whether it is CPF or  cash,  is

not  a  sure-win strategy.  So they understand why it  is

good  to  be  prudent about the use of CPF funds  to  pay

mortgage  interest.  Most of all, they were reassured  to

learn

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>

that   all  HDB  subsidised  loans  and  current  non-HDB

mortgages will not be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation to increase the take-home pay of

lower-income  workers  by moving the  contribution  floor

band  from  between $200-$363 currently to between  $500-$750 was also accepted as well meaning and helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, the most touchy subjects are

those  affecting people's wallets.  So the  most  intense

feedback and interest is naturally in this area.   First,

workers  remember the Government's reassurance  that  the

cut  in  the employers' CPF contribution will be restored

as  quickly as possible in line with what the economy can

bear.   They see this stand echoed in the Sub-Committee's

proposals, and they welcome that.  And today, we hear DPM

Lee has once again given this reassurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they remember that the Government has

endorsed  the view that the CPF should not be seen  as  a

convenient   tool   for  managing  swings   in   business

conditions.   It was for this reason that the  tripartite

National  Wages  Council proposed  the  Monthly  Variable

Component  for  the  wage system.  The Sub-Committee  has

reinforced support for this stand.  The need to safeguard

the  CPF from new cuts is all the more necessary  as  the

CPF will henceforth be refocused to provide the basic  in

those  three key needs.  Workers do not want to  live  in

constant  fear  that  their  nest  egg  may  be  targeted

repeatedly  because  of  economic  turbulence.    Workers

expect   the  Government  and  employers  to  take   this

seriously and live up to this commitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, many workers who are in the 50-55 years band

dislike  the recommendation to freeze the employers'  CPF

contribution rate for them at the present  16%.   Why  is

that so?  In my view, this results from a combination  of

anxiety  and  skepticism.  There  are  workers  who  have

ongoing  commitment to service, and who have had to  face

increased financial burdens when the employers' CPF rates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>

were  cut  in 1998.  And they, like everyone  else,  were

looking forward to progressive restoration of the cuts to

ease  their burdens.  When they hear that their hopes  of

further  restoration  have disappeared,  they  feel  that

loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, in my assessment of the feedback, I think

skepticism is far stronger than anxiety.  Skeptical about

what?  I think it is about two things in particular; one,

it   is   about  the  purpose,  perhaps  the  intent   of

Government's action; secondly, it is about the  measures'

likely effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said earlier that workers almost immediately

understood the rationale for most of the recommendations.

And  they had little difficulty in accepting those.  Why?

It  is because those recommendations are intuitive.   You

need  more  money in the old age, so you must  save  more

now.  House prices may go up or they may go down, so  you

had  better not put too much of your old-age savings into

property  play.   So  it makes sense to  workers  because

these are obvious logic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this recommendation to freeze the employers'

CPF  contribution for the 50-55 year olds, it seems  what

is  obvious to many of the workers is that they see other

people going to get their restoration, but they would not

get their restoration.  So their natural reaction is: why

are  you targeting me?  Do I not need the money just like

everyone  else?   And  so  some  may  even  question  the

Government's  intent,  and  wonder  whether  it  is  done

primarily to give employers some cost savings.   And  for

good  measure,  they also question whether  such  a  move

would, in any case, be effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that it is extremely important for the

Government  to explain clearly, and may I say repeatedly,

through all available channels to our workers its sincere

intent  in this set of proposals.  Older workers want  to

know  that  the Government has their interests at  heart,

that  the  Government cares for them. They want  to  know

what  the  Government  will do to make  sure  that  their

interests are indeed well looked after on an on-going and

holistic basis.  Older workers want the Government to do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>

more   to   guide   employers  into  positive   behaviour

concerning  them  so that they will have fair  treatment.

The  specific suggestions on fair rewards, job  redesign,

pointed  out by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang earlier, are pertinent.

They want the Government to signal clearly that they  are

as  precious  to this country as any other  Singaporeans.

Sir, this is a frightened group.  And Sir, it is not just

about  this particular recommendation alone.  It  is  not

only about dollars and cents either.  It is about how the

Government can let the workers know that it is firmly  on

their side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intent of the Sub-Committee and the

Government clearly indeed is not to reduce the pay of any

older worker.  What I see is a Government trying its best

to  help  by improving the cost competitiveness of  older

workers, so that more among the older workers might  have

more  years  of  working and earning.  This  intent  must

therefore not be misunderstood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I am happy to hear DPM Lee's

announcement  earlier in this House that  the  Government

will  do  more  for  older  workers  through  the  Skills

Redevelopment    Programme   and   the    People-for-Jobs

Traineeship  Programme, and that the  Government,  as  an

employer,  will take the lead to top-up the  salaries  of

deserving  civil service workers affected by the  freeze.

Let this be a clear signal to the private sector that the

labour  movement  expects fair play for  workers  in  the

private  sector  and  that  we  call  on  private  sector

employers  to emulate the Government's action  for  civil

servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government inform

all  employers specifically, for example, through the CPF

Board, about its call for them to treat deserving workers

fairly in this CPF restructuring exercise and also  point

out  that  the Government has set the example.   In  this

way,  we  would ensure that all employers get the message

and   that  no  employer  can  misrepresent,  or  present

incomplete pictures to their less-informed employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I further urge the Government to consider the

fact that, notwithstanding any improved employability  to

be enjoyed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>

by this group of older workers, they do not enjoy further

CPF  restoration.   Thus, I appeal to the  Government  to

take this into account in future asset-sharing exercises,

such  as  CPF Top-ups, and to give more to these  workers

who  are missing out during this transition period as CPF

is progressively restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, it is important for all of us

to  maintain our focus on the big picture.   The  aim  of

good  government must be to secure a better life for  its

citizens.   The  outside  world is  changing  fast.   The

inside world is ageing rapidly.  The risks of dislocation

are  rising.   Adjustments must be made, and  adjustments

will be inconvenient and, sometimes, painful in the short

run.   Yet, this House must have the fibre to do what  is

right  by  our countrymen, in order to lead  them  safely

through the raging storms.  We owe this to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for

allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in discussing changes to the CPF system, I

think we will need to focus on the key issues and some of

the  underlying  reasons  that  led  to  the  Committee's

recommendations.  A key issue that the ERC has to address

is  a  fast ageing population and how to adequately  meet

their  retirement needs of which the CPF  is  a  critical

component.  The average lifespan of Singaporeans has been

increasing  over the years.  As a result, in 2030,  there

will be 796,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above, more than

three times the number in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from this, Sir, there are two issues that

have  to  be addressed.  First, people have to save  much

more   for  retirement.   Second,  people  have  to  stay

employed  longer.   The statistics  on  both  counts  are

worrying.   On the first point, it is clear  that  people

are  just  not  saving  enough  for  retirement,  despite

Singapore having one of the highest savings rate  in  the

world.  In fact, only about half of the CPF members  will

be able to reach the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>

Minimum Sum of $80,000 when they reach 55.  For many, CPF

has become the only source of retirement savings.  As use

of  CPF funds to purchase homes became more liberal, more

and  more  funds were channelled into housing.  In  1990,

$1.9  billion  was withdrawn for public housing  but,  in

2000,  the figure had increased to $8.2 billion, a  four-fold   increase.    During  the  same   period,   private

residential  property purchases also went up three  times

from $1.5 billion in 1990 to $4.2 billion in 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ERC's proposal to increase the Minimum Sum

and  the  Special Account contribution rate will help  to

address  the current imbalance, and ensure that  more  of

the  CPF  savings will be used for retirement.   However,

this  by itself is insufficient.  More has to be done  to

educate  Singaporeans to be prudent in  using  their  CPF

money  for  housing  purchases.  Housing  is  a  critical

component of our social safety net, and should  remain  a

core  element of our CPF system.  No amount of assistance

can give the same kind of assurance as having a roof over

one's  head.  But the era of continuous and uninterrupted

high  growth  is  over.   And so is lifetime  employment.

People  now  have to take a lot more risks  arising  from

economic  and  business restructuring.  So,  in  deciding

what  house to buy, Singaporeans will have to  take  into

account these new realities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to call upon the Government to do

a lot more in educating Singaporeans on this new economic

and  employment landscape.  I would even suggest that  we

educate people from the time they are in school about the

realities  of the job market and some amount of financial

planning as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is one of employment for older

workers.  As people live longer, they have to work longer

too.   The facts, however, are not promising.  Statistics

show  that older workers are the ones that are  the  most

affected   by   retrenchments  and  face   the   greatest

difficulty in getting re-employed.  This is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>

a  consistent pattern throughout all the recessions.   In

1998,  51%  of those retrenched were older  workers.   In

2001,  46%  of those retrenched were older  workers.   In

both recessions, the proportion of those re-employed  who

were  in the older age group was lower than those in  the

younger  age  group.   In  other  words,  we  do  have  a

structural unemployment problem and the older workers are

the worst hit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this context that one has to view the

non-restoration of the 4% for workers between the ages of

50  and  55  years.  Since 1986, we have been introducing

changes  to  our wage system but progress has been  slow.

The  monthly variable component, for instance,  has  been

implemented by only 4.8% of companies in Singapore.   The

average  minimum  and  maximum salary  ratio  is  now  at

1.5:2.0,  lower  than  previous  years,  but  still  high

compared  to many countries.  Hence, our wage system  has

remained very much seniority-based, and older workers are

placed at great risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received feedback that older workers are

beginning to feel that they are now unwanted or  useless.

At one dialogue session with trade unionists, one of them

said  that we should not talk about the problem of  older

workers  as  it only makes the situation  worse.   But  I

think  that  not talking about the issue of employability

of  older workers will not make the problem disappear, as

the  facts  tell  their own story.  By  discussing  these

issues  openly,  we  stand  a better  chance  of  raising

awareness and of collectively finding solutions to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our older workers have contributed

significantly to Singapore's prosperity and growth.  What

has  to  be addressed is the seniority-based wage system,

to   inject  greater  flexibility  and  make  wages  more

reflective  of the job value.  Hence, I strongly  support

DPM's  call  that employers pass on part  of  their  cost

savings to deserving workers in this age group.  And I am

most  heartened that the civil service will take the lead

by implementing a Transitional CPF non-restoration Top-up

Scheme for civil servants aged 50-55.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the recent statement by Singapore

Technologies,  a  GLC, that it will pay  deserving  older

workers  in line with the ERC's recommendations, is  also

most  reassuring.   I also call upon  all  the  statutory

boards and the other GLCs to follow suit.  This will send

a strong message to private sector employers that the non-restoration  of  the  CPF  is  not  just  a  cost-cutting

exercise,  but  is  aimed at enhancing wage  flexibility.

Hence,  I do hope that the private sector employers  will

exhibit  the same spirit shown by the Government  in  its

capacity  as an employer, and we will not have  too  many

disputes on our hands over this issue.  The NTUC will  do

its  part, when the restoration takes place, to ask  that

employers pay to deserving older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also welcome the Government's move to extend

the  People-for-Jobs  Training Scheme  and  increase  the

support  period for those above 50 years to nine  months,

instead of the present six months.  I would like to  urge

the  Government  to review other ways  in  which  we  can

ensure non-discrimination against older workers by virtue

of  their  age  alone.  There have been  complaints  from

older  workers  who  have  undergone  training  and   are

prepared  to  take lower take-home pay  that  they  still

cannot find jobs.  If employers persist in discriminating

against  older workers because of age, then MOM may  have

to consider a more effective enforcement mechanism, other

than  the tripartite guidelines on non-discrimination  at

work, to deal with this problem.  MOM should also monitor

the  employment trends in companies and consider  denying

work  permits to those who show a consistent  pattern  of

not  employing older workers in jobs where age is  not  a

requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, overall the recommendations are

balanced,   but   there  are  older  and   lower   income

Singaporeans  who  will  face difficulties,  particularly

during the adjustment period.  I therefore call upon  the

Government  to  monitor the situation of  this  group  of

Singaporeans and extend all possible assistance to  them.

I also agree with my other parliamentary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>

colleagues from the labour movement to ask the Government

to  consider giving them extra shares or CPF top-ups,  as

and when the Government makes such payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the changes to the CPF.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the CPF scheme has been set up  to  ensure

that  the  people  have enough savings to  satisfy  their

retirement   needs.   But  over  the  past   years,   the

conditions  and  rules  governing  our  CPF  system  have

gradually  been  relaxed. The people are lavishly  making

use  of  their  CPF money for various purposes,  such  as

purchase   of  property,  shares,  insurance,  children's

university  education,  medical expenses,  and  even  for

childbirth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, any change to the employer's CPF

contribution rate would attract a lot of attention as  it

has  formed a component part of the wages of the  people.

So,  any reduction in this rate will be viewed as  a  pay

cut.   In  a  bad  time, a reduction  in  employers'  CPF

contribution  is  advocated  as  a  means  to  help   the

employers  tide over the troubled waters to  ensure  that

jobs  are  saved,  and  the workers  are  asked  to  make

sacrifices  in  order  that  they  can  go  through   the

difficult period together with the employers.  This  kind

of  sacrifice  is  worthwhile.  At  this  time  when  the

economy is beginning to pick up, we are proposing to  cut

their  CPF  contributions  because  of  new  factors  and

circumstances. I think such an arrangement at  this  time

warrants our further deliberation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whatever reasons, the effect of all these

arrangements  is that the workers' pay is  reduced.   The

employers  reduce their wage cost.  The  Government  gave

two  reasons why they cut the CPF contributions.  One  of

the  explanations is that the people in the higher income

brackets  have their own means to flexibly  manage  their

savings.   They do not have to depend on this  compulsory

savings scheme to meet their retirement needs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>

They have enough means to look after themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government said was only partially correct.

The  incorrect  part  is  that  why  the  20%  employer's

contribution from $5,000 to $6,000 is taken away.   Under

this  new  measure,  before the employee  could  flexibly

manage   the   $200  per  month  of  reduced   employee's

contribution, he already loses $200 due to the cut in the

employers' CPF contribution.  I think this new measure is

unfair to the employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ERC has already mentioned in passing

that  the employers should try to pass on the savings  to

their  employees, it has not given any indication of  how

this  arrangement can materialise.  I would  expect  that

the  employers will simply pocket the savings, and  leave

the  employees  to  work out their own  problems.   There

should  be  more  concrete measures to  ensure  that  the

employees will stand to benefit from the savings of their

employers,  so  that this saving from the employer's  CPF

contribution will become a component of the wages.  So  I

hope  that the Government will take the lead to  pass  on

this  benefit to the civil servants and make it  part  of

the  variable wage component, to set an example  for  the

private sector employers to emulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report, it was also recommended that

employers'  CPF contribution for workers  aged  50-55  be

frozen at 16%.  In other words, for employees in this age

group, when the employers' CPF contribution rate for  the

other  workers is fully restored to 20%, theirs  will  be

frozen at 16%.  The reason given for this proposed change

is  to  ensure  that  people in this age  group  who  are

unemployed  will find it easier to get a job,  and  those

currently employed will not be retrenched so readily.   I

have some doubts on this measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, from the way it is worded, I observe that

this  measure  is  to  tackle a  problem  when  there  is

retrenchment and high unemployment rate. This is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>

presumption  for  this measure to  be  taken.   In  other

words, when the economy has recovered, and there is  full

employment,  there will be no meaning  to  this  measure,

except that the wages of the workers are reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1988 until today, the economic performance of

Singapore  was good for about 70-80% of the time.   There

were  only about 20-30% of the time when our economy  was

bad.  The contribution rate of CPF should be based on the

good  times and make adjustment when the economy is  bad.

In  other words, we should not use the standard made  for

the  bad times as a general policy.  This is because when

the  economy has recovered, all these cuts and reductions

in  the  CPF contribution rates are unable to be restored

because it is a general policy.  The consequence is  that

the workers are unable to make good their losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are workers who are aged 50-55 really that

old,  that useless, or their salary is so high that  they

are  not worth employing?  If this assumption is correct,

and it is also reflected generally, then we should take a

look  at our Members in this House today.  More than  50%

of  our  Members of Parliament are above the age  of  50.

From this angle, we can see clearly one point, ie, age is

not  a  hindrance to employability.  The point is whether

they  can  get  their money's worth or are they  able  to

contribute their worth, to get their job and to make them

worth  being  employed.  Cutting of  the  employer's  CPF

contribution is not the solution to their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From statistics, there are some 12,000 people in

this  age  group who are currently unemployed.   Does  it

mean that once their CPF contribution rate is reduced  to

16%,  they will automatically get employment? Before  the

full  recovery  of our economy, their employability  will

mean  the  unemployability of  other  people.  One  older

worker  employed will mean one younger worker unemployed.

Using  the  same  argument, do we want  to  cut  the  CPF

contribution rate of these younger workers to 16% to help

them get employment?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen if our economy is fully recovered?

The workers enjoy full employment and, again, the foreign

worker  population rises above 500,000.  All the  workers

aged   between  50-60  are  no  longer  faced  with   the

employability pressure.  My question is whether  we  will

base  on  the  same  argument  to  reinstate  their   CPF

contribution.  The argument is when employability is  low

we  cut  their  CPF.  When there is no such employability

pressure, should not the CPF be restored?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above points raised, I have a lot of doubts

about this measure.  I feel that the argument of freezing

the  CPF  of those aged 50-55 at 16% to ensure that  they

keep  their jobs or help the retrenched workers  to  find

jobs is weak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the strong negative opinion on the cut in

employer's  CPF contribution, there are also  many  other

ERC's  recommendations on changes  to  our  existing  CPF

system.   In general, there are measures which  would  be

beneficial  to  the  people.  I support  the  Ministerial

Statement to accept these recommendations.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, first of all, I would like to commend  the

Economic  Review  Committee in  adopting  a  consultative

approach  to discuss with the people and also to consider

all  the  impacts on the people from all  walks  of  life

before they make their recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to feedback from the people, this process

of consultation is very good.  I hope that in future when

Government wants to make any new policies, it  would  use

such a consultative approach.  It may be more work but  I

think it is worth it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that the CPF scheme has contributed

greatly  to  our  nation-building.   Since  the  time  of

independence, we have been proud of our CPF system as  it

serves  as  a  safety net for the welfare of our  people.

With   this   CPF   safety  net,   we   facilitated   the

implementation  of  the  home ownership  scheme  for  our

people  and  took  care of healthcare  expenses  for  our

people through the Medisave scheme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>

Apart  from  its  role as a social safety  net,  the  CPF

scheme  has  also  been  used as  a  sort  of  buffer  in

adjusting the wages of our workers during the bad  times.

If  we do not have CPF, then we would have to hit on  the

actual wages of our workers, and I think it would be more

difficult for us to recover from a recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the acute recession in the 1980s, we helped

the  businesses  to  reduce their labour  costs  to  stay

afloat  by cutting the employers' CPF contribution rates.

This way, most of the businesses managed to tide over the

difficult times with the workers' rice-bowls kept intact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after the recovery of the economy, people

began to withdraw excessively from their CPF accounts  to

speculate on the property market. This is a genuine cause

for concern. There should be some restrictions on the use

of CPF money for property investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people feel that with globalisation,

competition has become very intense. We should  therefore

have  a  comprehensive review of our existing CPF system.

The functions and roles of CPF are becoming more and more

complicated.   Now, CPF is also used as an  adjuster  for

the employability of our workers!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the ERC report and DPM Lee's

statement,  I  would  like to  present  my  views.   This

adjustment of CPF income floor from $200 to $500 is  very

good.   In 1996, when I was in NTUC, we proposed  to  the

Ministry of Manpower to raise this income floor  for  CPF

contributions in order to encourage more women to  return

to the workforce. It was then turned down. I am glad that

it  has now been recommended by the ERC.  So, I hope that

on this occasion, more women would take advantage of this

scheme  to  get  back to the workforce.   Just  now,  the

Minister  for  Manpower has said that we may  delay  this

scheme  because  of  the economic recession.   I  beg  to

differ.   If  we  want  to improve our  productivity,  we

should  encourage more women to return to the  workforce.

One  of  the important points is that we should encourage

more flexible

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>

work   schemes   or  part-time  jobs   for   the   women,

particularly  when  their  husbands  are  retrenched   or

unemployed.  It will be all the more important  that  the

women  return to the workforce.  They can help to support

the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the reduction of CPF contribution rate from

40%  to 32% for older workers between the ages of 50  and

55,  this is one of the most hotly discussed topics.  For

workers  in  this  age group, they  will  not  see  their

employers' CPF contribution rate restored to 20% when the

others finally get theirs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the South West Community Development

Council's  job-matching data, those who are  affected  by

economic  recession  and have come  to  us  for  help  in

getting  a  job, some 30.5% are from the 40-49 age  group

and 13% from the 50-59 age group.  So, strictly speaking,

those  who  are  affected  are not  confined  to  workers

between the ages of 50 and 59.  Even those who are 40 and

above are already affected by this retrenchment trend.  I

was quite surprised by the figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some consultation, the Government's

recommendation  now is to reduce the CPF rates  only  for

those  between 50 and 55.  Of course, the presumption  is

that  by  reducing the labour cost on these workers,  the

employers will be less inclined to retrench them and they

stand  a  better  chance  of retaining  their  jobs.  But

whether or not this will create employability, I think we

have to look further into it. Employability concerns  not

only the labour cost, but also on other attributes of the

workers  such  as work attitude, competence,  ability  to

work  as  a  team, etc.  I hope the Ministry of  Manpower

would  set  up a committee to look into the employability

of workers who are 40 years and above and conduct more in-depth study into their employability issues.  A number of

schemes are already in place to help them but whether  or

not  they  are effective, we do not know.  We  have  also

introduced this incentive for lifelong learning.  But has

this been proven to be effective?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I would like to bring up concerns

the  4% reduction in employers' CPF contribution. I would

suggest  we set aside 1%  for a Personal Training Account

in the CPF.  This point has been brought up several times

before.   I think this will tell the workers that  we  do

not  want  just to reduce their CPF, but we want  to  set

aside  part of it to set up a training account for  them.

Perhaps,  1% should be used to set up a training  account

in their CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that I feel that employers should

be  more positive in their attitude.  Over the years,  we

have  read  a lot of reports in the newspapers concerning

discussions  on  how to reduce business  cost,  including

labour  cost. As reflected in these reports, it is always

the  trade  unions  and the Government who  are  actively

pursuing the matter. Very little has been reported on the

employers'  involvement in this.  We  talk  a  lot  about

globalisation  nowadays. But it is always the  Government

which  is  doing  the talking.  In other  countries,  all

sorts  of  projects are initiated by the private  sector,

eg,  IBM,  AT&T,  Johnson  & Johnson,  etc,  whereby  the

workers  are briefed on the global trend of business  and

the  company's  reaction  to all these  changing  trends.

This  would  enable  the workers to know  what  direction

their  company is heading towards so that they  could  do

the  necessary  adjustment and make early preparation  to

adapt  to  all  these  changes.  But  in  Singapore,  our

employers  are not very active.  Here in Singapore,  only

the  MCDS  is  doing this sort of thing. I feel  that  we

should  explain  to  our workers the perspective  of  the

employers,  let  them know the competition  that  we  are

facing and the various aspects of globalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel our employers should not wait for the

Government to solve their problems for them.  They should

be  more  proactive  in explaining  to  the  workers  the

importance  of training and the importance  of  enhancing

their productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to touch on is the

Minimum  Sum.  At the moment, our target is  $80,000  but

after  2003, it is suggested that it goes beyond $80,000.

I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>

personally  support this because with our families  going

into  nuclear family units, many senior citizens need  to

work  to  support  themselves.  Of course,  we  want  our

children to be filial to their parents.  But nowadays, we

can see there are more single parents and a lot of people

have  no children to support them.  With the increase  in

the  Minimum Sum, better protection will be provided  for

the old folks to meet their retirement needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those higher income workers, we have now

reduced the income ceiling for CPF contributions.  I feel

that  they  should  be able to take  care  of  themselves

because  they  are among the top 12% of  our  population.

The   Government   has   introduced   the   Supplementary

Retirement Scheme whereby the high income earners can set

aside  additional savings in it to earn better  interest.

I  would  like to know what is the take-up rate for  this

scheme since its implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have been investing in shares. I do not

think  that many of them have actually made profits  from

there.  Perhaps, we should have more education programmes

for our CPF members so that they would know how to invest

wisely.   I  think most Singaporeans do not have  a  good

enough knowledge on how to invest their money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the people's reaction to these

recommendations to change our CPF system is certainly not

as  hotly debated as the earlier 3-cent increase  in  bus

fares.   I  think  this  is probably  due  to  the  prior

consultative  approach  by the Government.   Singaporeans

are  very  rational.   They understand  that  under  this

globlisation    trend,   in   order   to    retain    our

competitiveness, we have to reform.  But I urge  the  ERC

and  MOM to set up a committee to review and to re-assess

the effect of all our training schemes so that they could

be  implemented more effectively and workers who  are  40

and above would increase their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Ministerial Statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, we have

literally come one full circle.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>

When the CPF scheme was set up in 1955, it started off as

a  very conservative scheme.  In the 1980s and 1990s,  we

started on a liberal track and now, we are trying  to  be

back on the conservative route.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, I congratulate the ERC Sub-Committee on its recommendations in focusing on the three

key  aims of the CPF, which are housing, medical care and

old-age subsistence.  Sir, the recommendations remove the

uncertainty  in the property market and, hopefully,  will

bring about a sustainable and rational property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the proposal to increase the contribution

to the Special Account by 1%.  Sir, I remember when I sat

on  the  Inter-Ministry Committee on Ageing, one  of  the

concerns of the Committee was whether, when people  reach

old  age,  they  have  sufficient savings  in  their  CPF

account.  I am very happy to see that this recommendation

has been included in the ERC and is seeing fruition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the ERC that the amount set aside

for our old-age subsistence should be increased gradually

to  adjust  for cost of living and increasing income.   I

also  welcome the measure to give low-income workers more

take-home  pay by raising the employee CPF wage  band  to

$500-$750.  I am confident that this would also encourage

more  to  join the workforce and enjoy a bigger take-home

pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the issue of

employability of older workers in the age group of  50-55

years  whose  employer and employee  CPF  rates  will  be

capped  at  16%.   I would like to ask  the  DPM  whether

reducing the CPF rates for this group will increase their

employability.    The  market  mechanism,   as   it   is,

determines the salary of these older workers.   Many  who

were  re-employed after their retrenchment were  actually

re-employed at lower salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the unemployment figure for

this  age group is about 11%.  This is due to the present

economic climate.  I remember watching a Channel

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>

NewsAsia  interview last week which highlighted that  for

many  employers, the reduction of the employers' CPF rate

would  not  make  them  recruit older  workers.   Sir,  I

sincerely  have  my  doubts whether  this  measure  would

really help the older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, I would like to ask the DPM as to how

many  older workers have been recruited by the Government

over  the last few years and whether the latest  CPF  cut

would  mean  that  the  Government itself  would  set  an

example by recruiting older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would help to give us a better gauge as to

whether this measure will have the impact that it  really

intends  to have.  My sense is that we have unnecessarily

cut  the  wages of 89% of the workers in trying to  solve

this  problem.  In addition, I would like to ask  whether

we  can expect the private sector to reward older workers

by  channelling  the  reduced  CPF  contribution  to  the

monthly  variable component of the salaried staff.   Sir,

as  Mdm  Halimah highlighted, as it is, only 4.8% of  the

private  sector  employers contribute  to  this  or  have

started  implementing  this monthly  variable  component.

For  a start, to expect the employers to include this  is

itself  an  uphill task.  And I wonder whether this  will

have  the desired effect in asking the employers  in  the

private sector to pass on the cost saving in this CPF cut

to the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it is, it is not a mandatory measure and to

expect  the  employers  to do so  without  any  mandatory

requirement, I think is a very difficult exercise  and  I

am  not sure whether we will succeed.  Perhaps, we  could

have   carefully  considered  this  particular   measure.

Upgrading  their  skills, creating more jobs  would  have

been  a better option and even perhaps having this  as  a

short-term measure and reverting back to a 20%  employer-employee  contribution would be better when  the  economy

recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the changes in the CPF

housing scheme.  Here, there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>

are  many questions which are thrown up, which I am quite

sure  many Singaporeans want to know the answers.   First

of  all,  was there a real necessity to tinker  with  the

system  which  has served us well?  CPF members'  savings

were protected, as the bank mortgage took second priority

to   the   CPF  charge  in  private  property  purchases.

However,  this  has now changed.  When there  is  nothing

fundamentally  wrong  with the present  arrangement,  why

change the regime?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, once the banks are given priority in

unsubsidised  housing loans for HDB flats  and  they  are

entitled to take possession and sell these flats when the

owners  default,  it throws up a bigger  question.   Many

creditors whose debtors are staying in HDB flats will now

pressure and ask the Government if private banks can  now

take   over  HDB  properties  and  realise  their  loans.

Certainly  other  creditors out there will  pressure  the

Government  to open up the HDB property to be  seized  by

other  creditors to whom the owner of the flat owes  them

money.   And do we move on to the second stage and remove

this  protection for subsidised HDB flats away from these

creditors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to-date, HDB is very sympathetic to HDB

borrowers.   It grants them extended periods  to  pay  if

they are in financial difficulties, and repossession is a

measure  of  last  resort.  How will the Government  then

ensure  that such measures will be in place to provide  a

buffer  for such people?  And I am quite sure the  number

of  people  who are going to take loans from the  private

banks  for purchasing HDB flats will only grow in number.

The next time a recession comes along, I think there will

be  a  greater expectation on the part of this  group  of

Singaporeans  to pressure the Government to pressure  the

banks  to  withhold taking action against them.   Sir,  I

wonder whether the Government will take into account  the

interest of the bank or the interest of the borrowers  in

trying to arrive at a solution that is palatable to  both

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second element is that, at the moment, the

interest rate in the market is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>

very  attractive.  As such, many will go and take a loan.

But  in future, interest rates will increase and many  of

the  borrowers will default on their loans.   Again,  the

question  arises:  how do we temper  the  pain  that  the

population will face when interest rates rise?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, another issue that again arises is that

when  the  bank repossesses the property and the mortgage

sale  proceeds are unable to satisfy the amount withdrawn

from  the  CPF  account, will the CPF Board  pursue  full

legal  remedies  against the members?   Because,  at  the

moment,  if one has paid up the CPF account and the  bank

is   not paid in full, the bank will take legal action to

recover the full amount.  But with the new scenario, when

the member is unable to pay up the CPF amount in full, my

question  is:  will  the  CPF Board  take  legal  action,

including  making  one bankrupt, to make  sure  that  his

account is repaid back?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Sir, by allowing the 10% downpayment to be

paid  from the CPF account, whether this will kick  start

the  property  market and actually go against  the  anti-speculation measures that we have in place as far as  the

property market is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, in the past, reverse mortgages were not

feasible,   because   HDB  properties   were   considered

sacrosanct.  But now, with the liberalising  of  the  HDB

property  market and by allowing banks to provide  loans,

my   question  is  whether  reverse  mortgages   can   be

considered  as  a  serious  alternative;  and,  as  such,

whether  we  can allow more Singaporeans to cash  out  of

their property while they are staying in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on those notes, let me once again welcome the

major  recommendations of the Economic Review  Committee,

and I am quite sure that many of the intended purposes of

the Committee will see light.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on the changes to

the CPF scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nearly half-a-century-long legacy, the CPF has

created Singaporeans to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>

one  of  the  world's highest home owning population.   I

congratulate the move now by the Government to take stock

of the CPF and to re-evaluate it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to focus on five points. My first

concern  is  the alarming trend that over the years,  CPF

has  been heavily relied upon for home ownership.  I feel

that  too much of our savings in the CPF has been devoted

for our housing needs.  I wish to highlight statistics to

support  my concern.  As of 31st March 2002, $92  billion

has been withdrawn from the CPF Board for the purchase of

properties,  out of which about two-thirds are  used  for

public  housing.  From January to March this year  alone,

$3  billion was used for the purchase of properties, with

70%  of  it  tied  up  in  public  housing  schemes.   In

comparison, only $510 million is for retirement, and $114

million for healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern is the depletion of the value of

homes in deflationary times.  As rightly put forth by the

Economic  Review Committee, the property  market  has  an

impact  on many things.  To the many Singaporeans outside

this  House, they are most concerned with the  impact  on

individual  household,  financial  condition  and   asset

value.  Let me elaborate.  When property prices rise,  we

see a parallel increase in withdrawal in our CPF savings,

which  is  allowed based on the formula of withdrawal  at

150%  of  the  value of the property.  I agree  with  the

recommendation  that this be gradually lowered  to  120%,

the   reason  being  when  property  values  drop  in   a

deflationary   period  and  negative   asset   value   is

experienced  as too much money has been spent  on  buying

that  asset.  At present, some Singaporeans have  already

experienced a permanent depletion of their CPF savings as

a  result.  The value of their properties has fallen  and

may  not rise again to the level of their purchase price.

Today, the ownership of this form of asset, if not  fully

paid  for,  may  prove  to be a  liability  if  there  is

insufficient balance in one's CPF account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To curb such excessive spending, we must go back to

the  original  purpose of our CPF  savings   -   that  of

meeting our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>

retirement  needs.   We need to avoid a  situation  where

Singaporeans  are  cash poor and  asset  poor  when  they

retire.   We  must  therefore create a  public  awareness

programme  to  dissuade  Singaporeans  from  spending  on

property in anticipation of a double digit growth in  our

economy, as was seen in the late 80s and a good  part  of

the  90s.  Those years saw the value of properties rising

beyond  the reach of most Singaporeans.  But the  booming

property  market  has led many to throw  caution  to  the

wind.   To  expect  such time again is but  an  illusion.

With  Singapore becoming a more mature economy towards  a

developed nation, growth rates of a single digit such  as

3-5%  will  become  a  norm.  Future growth  in  property

prices  will follow economic trends, and we will not  see

fast  rising property market for some time to come.   The

need  to fork out cash under the new recommendation would

help  Singaporeans to be more realistic in buying a  home

not beyond their means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, I wish to draw DPM's attention to the

move  to  allow banks to participate in granting  housing

loans to HDB property owners.  This is indeed a bold move

by the Government.  Not only does it allow interest rates

to  be  pegged to market rates, it also allows  banks  to

have  first  claim against the property  before  the  CPF

Board.  However, to attract banks to participate in  this

sector, a strong resale market must be in place to  allow

banks  to  have  a  second  hand  market  to  dispose  of

properties  in  the event of a default by the  borrowers.

Here, HDB will have to monitor carefully the supply  side

of  the market and avoid an over supply, thus encouraging

buyers from choosing new flats as opposed to old ones  in

the resale market.  Some Singaporeans have voiced concern

over  the  banks taking on their role.  They are  worried

that   banks,   being   what  they   are,   profit-making

corporations will be less lenient and less ready to  help

the   man-in-the-street  during  economic  downturns   as

compared  to  the Government.  Banks are  accountable  to

their  shareholders and are concerned about their  bottom

line.   I would like to ask the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>

Minister whether safety nets will be put in place to help

families  whose homes might be seized by  the  banks  and

left homeless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another problem I wish to highlight is the

availability of cash if the balances in CPF  savings  are

not going to be sufficient enough to cater for retirement

needs.   Statistics from the CPF Board in the  year  2000

show  that  more than 600,000 CPF members have less  than

$80,000,  the  Minimum Sum required to be  maintained  in

their   accounts   by   July   next   year.    As    more

responsibilities in managing CPF savings are passed  down

to  contributors to the Fund, a liberal use  of  CPF  for

investment in the Ordinary Account must surely be reduced

gradually.  The Ordinary Account should be encouraged  to

grow in the same proportion, if not more than the Special

Account.  This is to ensure that savings in the  CPF  are

close  to  sufficient  for  old  age.   Total  CPF  funds

invested  as  at  31st March 2002 stood at  $26  billion.

Total  funds  still  available  for  investment  in   the

Ordinary  and  Special Accounts are $52 billion  and  $12

billion  respectively.  Furthermore, the balance  in  the

Special  Account  of $80,000  -  the Minimum  Sum  to  be

maintained in the CPF account  - will not meet the  needs

of  most Singaporeans as the standard of living rises and

people   tend   to   live  longer.    To   counter   this

vulnerability, the Government has recommended to increase

cash  available at retirement by raising CPF contribution

to members' Special Accounts by one percentage point once

CPF rates are restored to 40%, requiring the CPF to pay a

higher  and more appropriate long-term interest  rate  on

Special Account balances and raising the Minimum  Sum  to

be  kept  in  CPF  accounts beyond the current  level  of

$80,000.   These efforts may be too late and  too  little

for  some.  As most Singaporeans have a home now  and  as

income  potential  drops,  as  one  gets  older   or   is

retrenched,  the temptation to convert their property  to

cash  to  supplement their CPF increases.  This then  may

result  in  a whole new spectrum of housing problems  for

this  group  of people, as they have to find  alternative

housing.  What I foresee is a class of rental housing may

eventually  have  to  be created to  meet  this  possible

future need.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to voice my concern

on  the  CPF rate for older workers.  Under the proposal,

older  workers  will  see  their total  CPF  contribution

capped  at  32%,  down from the current 36%.   Their  own

contribution  rate will also be down  from  20%  to  16%.

This will be implemented when the Government restores the

targeted  CPF  contributions.  The Deputy Prime  Minister

has  assured us that this will not likely to happen until

2-4  years  later.  The rationale for  the  move  was  to

assist workers in this age bracket, as they are viewed to

be  at  greater risk of being retrenched, but  will  also

have  more difficulty of finding work at their last drawn

pay.  I beg to differ.  The proposed reduction alone will

not  achieve its good intention of retaining jobs for the

50-55-year old workers.  Workers in this age bracket will

have  to  change their mindset in order not  to  be  left

behind in a changing business and social environment.  In

this  respect, I hope that the Government will  speed  up

its  efforts in retraining this group of people, such  as

in the Skills Redevelopment Programme and the People-for-Job  Traineeship  Programme.  Moreover, the  decrease  in

employee's contribution from 20% to 16%  eventually  will

mean  less CPF savings and a higher income tax  bill  for

high-income  earners.  This may lead to employees  asking

for  lower  monthly salary with a higher year end  bonus.

This   is   because  bonuses  have  no  limits   in   CPF

contribution  as long as total CPF contributions  do  not

exceed  40% of total income for the year.  If this  trend

catches  on,  then  the change in contribution  rate  for

those in the 50-55 year brackets to 32% will not make any

difference to this class of people, thus neutralising the

effect of changes to CPF contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support wholeheartedly the recent

changes by the Government to mark the broad path  to  CPF

rate in the future by introducing fine adjustments to the

system,  rather than drastic changes, allowing  a  stable

transition  from a high asset based savings fund  to  one

that has a wider investment base that will keep pace with

inflation and achieve a higher liquidity ratio.  We  must

be prudent in our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>

investment  and not allow a high dependency to  occur  in

any one class of assets.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to raise two

concerns about the proposed CPF changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to urge the Government to stop

making micro decisions for Singaporeans.  Whether workers

between  50  and 55 get 16% or 20% CPF contribution  from

employers  is  something  that  should  be  decided  upon

between the employers and the employees.  Why should  the

Government make a blanket assessment and decide for  all?

There  could be employers out there who are still  highly

profitable  and want to reward some of their more  valued

older  workers with a higher contribution  rate  of  20%.

So,  instead of capping it at 16% for workers between  50

and  55, and even lower for those who are older, let them

-  the  employees  -  negotiate with their  firms  for  a

contribution rate in the range that is agreeable to  both

parties.  Should the Government not let go and stop micro

managing  for  its  citizens?  Empower  Singaporeans  and

their  companies to improve their negotiation skills  and

take  more  responsibility for  their  own  future.   Why

should the Government interfere in this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if some employers and higher-income employees

are  willing to stay at the $6,000 contribution rate, why

should  the Government force them and legislate to  lower

the  maximum rate to $5,000?  Please leave this  decision

to  them.   We are a developed economy.  Our high  income

earners  are  not there by coincidence.   They  have  the

intellectual capacity and maturity to decide how to  save

and  what to spend on.  Give those higher-income  earners

the  personal choice.  Empower them to plan for their own

retirement savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to express support

for  the  limits  on  the use of CPF funds  for  property

investment.   As a society, our savings are very  heavily

invested in property.  This is a very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>

unhealthy misallocation of our scarce resources.  Can the

Minister  tell us, as a nation, what is the total  amount

of  money  committed to property?  I suspect it could  be

near a few hundred billion dollars.  Therefore, a 1% drop

in  value  is going to wipe out billions from  our  asset

value.  The Government in aggressively promoting its home

ownership  policy has made Singapore very expensive.   It

all  started when CPF was freed up for property purchases

in  the early 90s.  So, it is a good thing that the  sub-committee is addressing this issue of over-investing  our

hard  earned  CPF money into property.  However,  I  feel

that  the  120% target over the next five  years  is  not

aggressive  enough.  The Government should be bolder  and

reduce  it  to below 100% in the long term.   Having  too

much  of our assets tied up in property is going to  cost

retirement    problems   for   our   aging    population.

Singaporeans  who think that they can retire  comfortably

by  selling  or downgrading their expensive property  for

profits   or  cash  should  seriously  reconsider   their

retirement strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that property prices are determined by

supply  and demand.  Assuming limited supply, prices  can

only  go  up  if  there  is a constant  high  demand  for

property  for  the next few decades.  But where  is  this

demand  going  to  come  from?   If  we  fail  to  remake

Singapore   from   an  investment  to  an  innovation-led

economy, if our economy wavers and growth declines due to

our  inherent  high cost, then, we are going  to  see  an

exodus  of  citizens and international  talents  to  more

attractive  cities to work and live.  If  and  when  that

happens,  our property values will plummet, and  this  is

going to create economic hardship and more bankruptcy for

our  citizens.   Those  citizens  who  rely  heavily   on

property assets as a means of retirement are going to  be

hardest  hit.   Therefore,  I  would  like  to  urge  the

Economic  Review  Committee  to  look  more  boldly   and

creatively into how this problem can be prevented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these two concerns, I support the other

changes as presented.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's

Office  (Mr  Matthias  Yao Chih):   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I

support the changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I heard a most painful story, and I want

to  share  this with the House.  This is an interview  on

BBC  radio, and the interview was with a woman,  and  she

was  from  Argentina.   As  we  know,  Argentina  is   in

financial  crisis;  peso has gone  down  in  value;  five

changes  of President in 12 days, and so on.  This  woman

who  was  interviewed had a tailoring shop which  failed.

And  all she had left were two pairs of scissors.   Every

day, she goes to the town square to sell her body to earn

some  money.   She  is 60 years old.   According  to  the

interviewer,  the reporter, this is not uncommon  in  the

city and in other parts of Argentina.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pain, and I hope that we will never see that

kind  of  pain in Singapore.  And to avoid big  pain,  we

have  to make small changes, incur small pains.  When  we

tighten  our  girders, when we chop off the loose  parts,

when  we tie up the shaky bits, there will be some  pain.

I  think  Singaporeans will understand enough  to  accept

small pains when they come to avoid the big pain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC is doing a lot of work. There are seven sub-committees, and they are all busy studying various

subject  areas.   There  are  working  groups  and   sub-committees and many consultation processes going on.   My

wish  was  that the entire ERC report comes  out  in  its

entirety  and then we can see the whole picture of  where

we want to go and how we want to go about achieving that.

But,  unfortunately,  some things are  more  urgent  than

others  and  we  have to make the announcements  as  they

come.   So,  we announced the tax changes, and today  the

DPM  announced  the Government's acceptance  of  the  CPF

changes.   Both are urgent, and both will have  long-term

implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, I was talking to a French

businessman who is stationed in Singapore, and we  talked

about  the  tax  changes.  And  he  said  that  he  loves

Singapore and he wants to live here and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>

work  here, but his operation in Singapore is very small.

Most  of  the business is done from another country  with

other  countries in the region.  But because of  the  tax

changes,  he is considering very seriously to  bring  the

bulk  of  his  business into Singapore and  be  based  in

Singapore  and  to  be  reported in Singapore  and,  more

importantly,  to be taxed in Singapore.  We  will  create

more jobs and we will collect more tax from his company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, just two months after the announcement,

immediately  we  see  this  kind  of  reaction  from  the

business community.  And I hope that more companies  will

consider the tax changes in such a positive way and  make

those  decisions  that are critical  to  our  future  job

creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the CPF changes, we have conducted more than 10

dialogue sessions, big and small, with our union leaders.

By  and  large, union leaders support the thrust  of  the

recommendations, which is to re-focus the CPF system back

to  its  basics  for  retirement expenditure,  for  basic

housing  and for medical care.  But, Sir, by no means  is

the  agreement  unanimous  as  far  as  the  details  are

concerned.  Naturally, when there is pain, people  react.

Some  union leaders were very concerned especially  about

the freeze of the employer's CPF contribution.  Some were

angry.   Many of them argued the same points that  Assoc.

Prof.  Low  Seow  Chay argued, perhaps less  passionately

than  him,  but making essentially similar points.   Some

even  got  angry  with NTUC leaders and  said  that  NTUC

should  be  the first to ask for wage increases  and  not

wage cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, to do nothing is to be irresponsible.

Among   the  trade  unions,  we  collect  statistics   of

retrenched  workers.  Let me share one set of  statistics

which  is very alarming to us, and this covered the  last

four  quarters.  In the second quarter of last year  when

we  were in recession, those who were retrenched from the

unionised companies, who were above 50 years old, was 10%

one  year ago.  For the second quarter of this year,  one

year  later, and we are seeing a pick-up in the  economy,

those who were retrenched and above 50 years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>

old  have gone up from 10% to 25%.  Let us bring the  age

lower,  down  to  age  40,  and  four  quarters  ago  the

percentage  of  those retrenched above 40 years  old  was

35%,  about a third.  In the second quarter of this year,

it  has gone up to 59%.  So, workers above 40 this  year,

as  a proportion of all workers retrenched from unionised

companies,  have gone up now to 59%, from 35% last  year.

And I puzzle over this.  Why is this so?  We are supposed

to  be  in a recovery.  The reason, I guess, and  we  are

going to do more research on this, is that last year,  in

a recession, companies folded.  So when a company closes,

the  whole  workforce goes, young and  old.   This  year,

things  are  different.  The economy is picking  up,  but

companies  are  still  retrenching.   And  they  retrench

because   they   merge,  because  they  outsource,   they

restructure,  they downsize, but they do  not  close  the

whole  company.   The  retrenchment is  selective,  small

departments here and there.  When the company  retrenches

selectively,  it is the oldest workers who are  the  most

vulnerable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we see this kind of trend, naturally we are

alarmed.   And the better the economy, the  worse  it  is

going  to  be.   As  China opens up  and  more  companies

relocate  away from South East Asia, including Singapore,

into  China, and as the rest of ASEAN countries pick  up,

more and more companies will outsource or restructure and

shift  part of their operations out of Singapore.   There

will be more selective retrenchments.  Hence, we need  to

do  something for our workers who are aged 50 and  above,

or even 40 and above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we explained this to union leaders, at least in

their  heads  they can understand, even though  in  their

hearts they feel very concerned about the effect of a CPF

freeze  on  the older workers.  But they understand  that

the  key  problem  is  really  the  seniority-based  wage

system,  and  it was the unions that have  been  pressing

employers  to  do something about it.  And  as  early  as

1986, Mr Lim Boon Heng already mooted the idea of a base-up  wage  system to bring the wage gap between the  older

workers and the younger workers closer, so that the older

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>

workers  will not face this problem.  And come the  Asian

financial  crisis, the same thing happened and NTUC  came

back  to  urge  employers to apply or  implement  a  wage

system that is more base-up, rather than seniority-based.

Employers  are  very slow to apply or  to  implement  the

measure.   The NWC, last year, called again  for  base-up

system.  Again, things are not moving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So really, we have to get to the key of the problem.

And  the  seniority-based wage system  is  not  a  common

system  in  the  world.   Over the  last  two  weeks,  my

officers   in  the  international  department   contacted

various  trade union counterparts all over the  world  to

find out what their system is.  So we did a quick survey,

not  a  scientific  one, but a rough  one.   In  the  US,

Canada,  Italy, Germany and France, they are all paid  by

job  rate.   This  is a job, this is  how  much  we  pay,

whether you are a man or a woman, young or old worker, it

is  the  same rate.  When there is an increase in salary,

everybody gets the same.  A fresh recruit comes in  at  a

certain  salary because he is new, there  is  a  learning

curve.  Within two or three years maximum, he reaches the

top  of  the scale, and he continues there.  Even  if  he

continues to work for 20 years, he is paid for  the  job.

He is not paid for how many years he stays in a company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan and Korea are the opposite. They have

seniority-based  system and see how  difficult  the  wage

system is, how painful it is for their workers who  enjoy

lifelong employment with very high salaries as they  grow

older,  how  difficult it is to retrench and to  downsize

their companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to do something quick. The retraining

programmes, the job assistance programmes, they take time

to  kick in.  A worker needs time to be retrained and  to

find reemployment.  But, immediately, what we want to  do

is  to  keep them in their jobs as far as possible.   And

therefore,   NTUC  supports  the  freeze   of   the   CPF

contribution  for older workers.  But at the  same  time,

the real issue is not the CPF, and the long-term solution

is not in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>

CPF.   The employers must now do their part to also  help

restructure  our wage system.  This cannot be  driven  by

the  unions and the workers.  The employers must do their

part.   They must address the wage system so that all  of

us can benefit from it and have a more competitive labour

and wage structure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some employers have dismissed the CPF freeze and

said  that  it is not effective.  Some MPs in this  House

too  have  dismissed it as ineffective.  Then the  answer

is,  if it is not effective, give it back to the workers.

It  is  very simple - put it back as a bonus, or MVC,  or

whatever  allowance.   There is no need  to  argue  about

this.   The Singapore Technologies has come out  with  an

announcement.   I  thank  them,  and  I  hope  that  more

employers  will publicly make a statement and follow  the

examples of Singapore Technologies and the civil  service

and put back whatever they think is not effective, in the

first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should all take a step back and look

at  the  broader picture and, today, we are just  talking

about  CPF.   We talked about the taxes in  the  previous

session.   As the other announcements are made  from  the

ERC  committees,  we should look at the  larger  picture.

Today,  we  have 14 recommendations, but most of  us  are

focused  on  the  CPF freeze for older  workers  and  the

property.   But  there  are more important  huge  changes

which   deserve   much  more  attention,   for   example,

management of the pension funds.  If every worker can get

one more percentage point from his savings, over 35 years

in  his  career, that will compound to a  lot  of  money.

That  deserves  a lot of discussion.  We should  be  much

more  curious  how it might work and get more  people  to

talk  about it and get the financial institutions to make

proposals and let us look at this.  Because it is not  so

important  about how we invest our funds in  unit  trusts

and  shares,  and so on.  If there is a properly  managed

fund that can give us a slightly better return compounded

over  many  years, it will make a real big difference  to

our workers' savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we look back at the CPF changes, we should

not be fixated on any single

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>

recommendation.   We have brought the refocusing  of  the

CPF  back  to  its basics.  But perhaps, Sir,  more  than

refocusing, it is really a re-balancing of the CPF system

so  that we get out of a trap of being asset-rich,  cash-poor into a more balanced situation where the three basic

needs are equally well looked after.  And if the proposal

works  here,  and  I am sure they will  work,  this  will

strengthen  our  social safety net for  our  workers  and

retirees  and,  hopefully,  it  will  also  keep  workers

working for as long as possible before they retire.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my parliamentary

colleagues  speaking before me have spoken eloquently  on

the  CPF  changes.  I should not repeat  what  they  have

said.  But I would like to comment on the part concerning

changes on HDB policy that DPM Lee announced earlier.   I

notice  that  our  Government is shifting  its  stand  on

previous  HDB  policy and I am uncomfortable  about  this

shift.   Indeed,  I am concerned for fellow  Singaporeans

over  the  untoward repercussions that  may  arise  as  a

result of it.  I shall further elaborate on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has one of the world's highest home-owning

population as a result of the Government's consistent and

sound  policy over the years.  More importantly,  it  has

been successful in fostering cohesive communities amongst

Singaporeans through HDB housing.  And, over  the  years,

Singaporeans  have  relied on the PAP Government  as  the

provider  for their basic necessity of having roofs  over

their heads.  They have rested their trust and confidence

on  the  Government  and they have peace  of  mind.   The

Government's  policy  has enabled  the  people  to  enjoy

affordable  and  hassle-free  housing  needs.   This  had

translated to the people's support for the PAP  at  every

election.   Sir, our HDB policy has been sound all  these

years and my question is: why fix it if it ain't broke?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my reservations on new HDB buyers who, being

ineligible for subsidised loans, have now to borrow  from

the  private banks rather than the HDB itself.   Allowing

home owners to get better

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>

market  interest rates from the private banks  is  not  a

sound  reason here because the interest rates charged  by

the  private banks may be better only for the  first,  or

second, year and subsequent years may work out to be more

than  the HDB's interest rate.  The market interest  rate

for  banks  now  is 2.8% compared with the  HDB's  3.75%.

However,  HDB's interest rate may not be  more  than  the

private  banks  for too long as the HDB  market  rate  on

mortgage  loans is pegged to the housing loan rates  that

DBS  Bank  charges  mortgagors.  As  and  when  DBS  Bank

adjusts  its  housing loan rate to these mortgagors,  the

HDB  market  rate will also be revised.   The  attractive

first  and second year interest rates offered by  private

banks  may  be short-lived during this economic  downturn

due  to the fact that banks are flushed with funds at the

moment.  The interest rates offered by private banks  may

be  lower  than  HDB's rate now but they had  hovered  at

around 6% for the last decade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new policy, many new HDB buyers are forced

to  hunt  around for banks to borrow money for their  HDB

flats.  They also have to be wary on terms and conditions

of  the  different banks on top of the different interest

rates  offered  by different banks.  I am  concerned  for

those  who  may  be less savvy on this.   They  may  have

trouble  looking for loans and they may even end up  with

unfavourable   loan   terms.   This   is   definitely   a

disadvantage  compared  to the previous  hassle-free  HDB

loan application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new ruling will also make it more difficult for

those who are not eligible for subsidised loan and having

to   upgrade  or  change  flats  for  whatever   reasons.

Borrowers  in  the private sectors are  subject  to  loan

criteria.  They now not only have to search for loans but

also  to  consider their eligibility for the loans.   The

quantum and the period of repayment of loans will  become

issues  depending on the income level and the age of  the

borrowers.   This  new ruling therefore  is  a  hampering

factor for many in the group of people who have to change

flats for various reasons and circumstances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.23 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private banks are more stringent with loans and are

stricter  with compliance of monthly payments.   Foremost

with private banks is the interest of their shareholders.

Default in payments will usually end up with repossession

of the flats.  The social role of HDB tends to make it  a

more understanding financier, that is, more forgiving  of

defaulters.  The HDB is more willing to offer  assistance

and  alternative payment methods to ease  the  burden  of

people   in  difficulty.   It  is  a  fact  that  several

financial  assistance measures are readily available  for

sold  HDB  flats.   These include the extension  of  loan

repayment  period  scheme, reduced repayment  scheme  and

deferment  of  mortgage loan instalment  payment  scheme.

The  HDB  is also more sensitive to the plight of  people

during  economic  downturns,  such  as  this  one.    For

example, HDB announced last month on the revised  reduced

repayment  scheme to further help those in difficulty  in

loan repayment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, private banks do not have such readily

available schemes and may not want to offer such  schemes

to those in difficulty.  Prices of property may fluctuate

and  banks have known to reassess housing loans in tandem

with   this   fluctuation.   There  is  a   saying   that

"commercial banks tend to give you an umbrella when it is

sunny,  only to take it back when it rains".  There  were

many  instances of banks recalling bank loans during  the

financial  crisis of 1997.  Although HDB flat prices  may

not  fluctuate as much as private property prices,  banks

may still call for top-ups if HDB flat prices drop.  This

will  hit  a  lot  of  HDB  flat borrowers,  the  average

Singaporean  heartlanders, real hard as  property  prices

usually fall during economic downturns.  The other  worry

is  that  since  banks  always  consider  the  tenure  of

properties for mortgage, those HDB flats with  less  than

99-year lease will be less favourable to them.  This  may

result in a drop in prices of older HDB flats

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>

and  may, therefore, affect the whole HDB resale  market.

How   will   the  Government  prevent  this   undesirable

consequence?  I am also concerned with the fact that  the

bank  will have first, and the CPF second, claim  to  the

mortgaged  HDB  property during forced sales  in  default

situations.  This is disadvantageous to the home  owners.

CPF  is  the most important saving of the people, and  it

worries me that people may lose their savings should they

be  unable  to service their housing loans.   Banks  will

sell   the   flats  under  mortgagee  sales  in   default

situations,  ending up with less than favourable  prices.

Thus, the HDB owners will invariably lose the CPF part of

their  money.  These unfortunate people also end up  with

no  roofs  over  their heads.  How  do  we  address  such

situations?  Do we have enough HDB rental flats to  house

these  people?   Does the Government have  any  plans  to

build  more  HDB  rental flats in  anticipation  of  such

situations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues in this House would agree with me that

many  of us had appealed to HDB and succeeded in allowing

many  defaulters  to  settle arrears  by  instalments  or

deferment  of  mortgage loans and so on.  MPs  cannot  be

appealing to the private sector financiers.  How  do  MPs

help  such defaulters then?  I can therefore see  one  of

the useful roles of MPs being eroded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask DPM Lee whether one of the CPF

proposals  on  the 120% cap on withdrawal limit  may  run

contradictory to the aim of discouraging over-investment,

as  buyers  may go for properties with higher  values  to

make sure that the valuation cap is not breached.  How do

we   overcome  this  and  encourage  people  to  consider

affordability issues and not to over stretch themselves?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new HDB policy may compel people to think

very  carefully in committing to a property within  their

means    and    would   therefore   enhance    individual

responsibility.  However, I feel that the implications  I

mentioned  earlier are too big a price to pay  for  this.

The  resultant repercussions, when unforeseeable  tragedy

hits,  will  be great distress to many Singaporeans.   We

may argue that there is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>

need to restructure and revamp to move forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that there are

certain  policies that are part of the obligations  of  a

good  government,  and  even if  a  policy  may  be  less

advantageous  to  the  Government,  as  long  as  it   is

beneficial to the people, the policy must remain.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I support the Government's acceptance  of

the  ERC's recommendation to make changes to the existing

CPF system.  This will reaffirm CPF three major functions

as  retirement  fund, medical expense and  housing  need.

But  on the proposal to reduce the CPF contribution  rate

for  workers aged between 50 and 55, I feel  there  is  a

need for further deliberation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee has explained that the

reason  for  this measure is to enhance the employability

of  this group of people.  But I feel that using the  CPF

contribution  rate  alone  to  tackle  this  problem   is

treating just the symptom but not the cause. Why do I say

this? This is because the low employment rate, relatively

fewer   chances   of  employment  and  higher   risk   of

retenchment  for  these  people are  mainly  due  to  the

seniority-based  wage system in Singapore.   Mr  Matthias

Yao  has  already explained this in detail.  I  will  not

repeat it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that if we use just the CPF alone,

before we could reap the benefits we will suffer the ill-effects first.  This is because the older people who  are

currently employed will automatically lose part of  their

wages.   Although the Government has taken  the  lead  in

announcing that it would pass on this part of the savings

from  the wage cost to the civil servants under the  TCTC

scheme, and Singapore Technologies has also responded  to

this  call, we cannot ensure that all the private  sector

employers   and  enterprises  will  follow  suit.    Some

employers will say, "The Government is asking us  to  cut

the CPF contribution to help us save on labour cost", and

then conveniently pocket the savings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is no guarantee that the

lowering  of  CPF  contribution  rate  will  enhance  the

employability of the workers in this age group.  This  is

because  if  the employer feels that the skill  level  or

work  attitude of the said employee is not  good  enough,

the  saving  of  4% CPF contribution will not  be  enough

incentive  for  him to change his mind. Furthermore,  the

lowering  of  CPF  rates for this group of  workers  runs

contrary to our intention to promote "equal pay for equal

work".  From the perspective of the employers, they  will

feel   that,  after  all,  the  Government  is  adjusting

downwards the labour cost from the age of 50 onwards, why

should they bother to promote the practice of "equal  pay

for equal work".  From the employees' point of view, they

will  also refuse to accept this equal-pay-for-equal-work

system   because  they  are  being  paid  a   lower   CPF

contribution.   Otherwise, they  would  be  hit  at  both

fronts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that the lowering of CPF

contribution  rate for older workers  will    hinder  the

establishment of an equal-pay-for-equal-work  scheme.   I

think  a  more positive way of resolving this problem  of

employability  of  older workers  is  to  accelerate  the

abolition of the seniority-based wage system through  our

tripartite  cooperation mechanism.  We must work  through

the  public education system to change the mindset of the

people  in order to help establish and promote the equal-pay-for-equal-work system.  With the new wage system, our

people  will  be more willing to accept skills  upgrading

and  retraining,  as  well as to adopt  a  pragmatic  and

realistic pay expectation. This is the way to enhance the

competitiveness of our labour market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's

stand on the proposed CPF adjustments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I would like, first, to commend the ERC Sub-Committee,  led  by  Mr  Tharman Shanmugaratnam  and  his

associated  working  groups, for recommending  such  bold

changes  to  the CPF system in the light  of  social  and

economic changes and,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>

particularly,   imminent  changes   to   our   population

demographics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current CPF system still fundamentally

serves  its  purpose, it is imperative  that  we  address

whatever   shortcomings  or  whatever  that  has   become

irrelevant in the current system at this juncture, taking

into  consideration the demographic shifts,  our  rapidly

aging  population and the uncertainties ahead of  us.   A

more delicate balance needs to be struck to cater to  the

three key needs of retirement expenditure, healthcare and

home  ownership,  which represent the  core  elements  of

financial security, while also paying close attention  to

the employability needs of our middle-aged workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on two issues. First, on the

recommendation  for lower CPF contributions  for  workers

aged  50-55 and, second, on limiting CPF withdrawals  for

housing loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern for the employability of our middle-aged

workers  was in fact first expressed in my maiden  speech

in  this  House  in  June 1997.  Having  experienced  the

strains and difficulties my family went through during my

younger days, when my late father lost his job and  could

not find another one for more than a year, I realised how

important  it  is  to keep family breadwinners  employed.

Recognising then the rigidity of our seniority-based wage

system,  I  had  then mooted the idea of a more  flexible

wage system for older workers which plateaus at a certain

point of a worker's age, and then gradually declines over

time,  so that their wages are more linked to skills  and

productivity.  This is to ensure that older  workers  are

not  at  risk  of  being first on  the  line  when  their

companies downsize or right-size.  Unfortunately, no  one

took  me  seriously at that time.  In  fact,  some  union

leaders  wondered who this "NKOB" or new-kid-on-the-block

was  up  to.  Today, it is an acknowledged fact that  our

seniority-based  wage system is more pronounced  than  in

other  countries.  As the saying goes, there is  no  such

thing as a free lunch.  Ask any businessman.  With labour

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>

cost   forming  a  large  chunk  of  business  costs   in

Singapore,   especially   in   manufacturing   companies,

overpaid  workers will be the first targets in a cut-back

exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, support the proposal to keep

employers' CPF contribution rate at the present 16% level

for  those  in the 50-55 age group, even as the  rate  is

gradually  restored  to 20%.  This will  inevitably  make

this  group of workers unhappy.  But we must be pragmatic

to  preserve the employability of this group of  workers.

I  see this not only as another step in unlocking some of

the  rigidities  in our labour market, but  also  a  very

important step.  11%, or 12,100 of the 110,000 workers in

this age group, are already unemployed currently and  are

having  difficulty finding new jobs.   Mr  Matthias  Yao,

Deputy Secretary General of NTUC, has just disclosed  the

grim statistics a moment ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutorily bringing down the employers' CPF

contribution,  in  conjunction  with  a  slew  of   other

measures,  especially  retraining and  skills  upgrading,

will help in retaining jobs.  It is undoubtedly better to

retain one's job with slightly lower pay than losing  it,

especially in the current economic climate.   It  is  not

only  more  difficult  to  get  a  new  job,  but  recent

statistics  also show that many unemployed older  workers

have  to  settle for jobs which pay much less than  their

last drawn wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it must be borne in mind that joblessness, more

so  than  poverty, causes tremendous strains on families,

and  robs  us  of role models, usually the  head  of  the

family.   However,  as  Mr Heng Chee  How  has  suggested

earlier,  it  is  important that the  Government  clearly

explains  this  move, that it is done with  the  workers'

interests in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the subject of limiting CPF

withdrawals for housing loans.  It is important to stress

that  the  changes proposed apply only  to  new  property

purchases  with  non-subsidised  HDB  loans.   The  Asian

financial  crisis and the recent economic  downturn  have

clearly signalled to private property buyers and HDB open

market upgraders that investments in property are not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>

without  risks and pitfalls.  Many who have committed  to

property  purchases during the boom period  before  1997,

are now finding themselves in a negative equity position.

While  those  who are employed see this  as  a  temporary

paper  loss,  there  are many Singaporeans,  particularly

those   who   have  lost  their  jobs,  who  are   facing

difficulties  as a result of their property  investments.

I know several of my grassroots leaders who have run into

big  trouble  because of their belief that investment  in

property  in  Singapore is very safe, and  that  property

prices  will  never go down, because of our  finite  land

supply.   The  property measures to cap CPF  savings  for

property  purchases, therefore, build not only safeguards

to   prevent  Singaporeans  from  putting  in   excessive

commitment   of   their   CPF   savings   into   property

investments, but will also ensure that more is set  aside

for  retirement  to  cater to the continually  increasing

living standards.  We should prevent ourselves from being

dubbed a nation where its people are asset-rich and  cash

poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our society matures, it is imperative that each

citizen    takes   responsibility   for   his   long-term

commitments,  whether  it  is in  property  purchases  or

setting  up  a business, consistent with his  income  and

affordability  levels.  Unless Singaporeans  shift  their

mindset   to  take  personal  responsibility  for   their

actions,  it  will  be  difficult for  us  to  evolve  an

entrepreneurial  culture which  has  been  identified  as

imperative to our future economic survival and growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am glad that the various proposals

of  the Committee, when accepted by the Government,  will

be implemented in stages, in line with the restoration of

the  employer CPF.  The recommendations serve to  enhance

the  long-term  orientation  in  balancing  and  ensuring

adequacy   for   a  more  sustained  retirement   income,

fulfilling the needs of increased healthcare cost as  one

ages, while also meeting the needs of home ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the proposed changes to the

CPF scheme as announced by the Deputy Prime Minister.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to

join  in the debate on the Ministerial Statement  on  CPF

and related changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Government's intention in general

as  enunciated  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  in  his

statement.   We know that the CPF is the most  basic  and

fundamental  savings  institution for  Singaporeans.   It

allows  us  to  prepare for our retirement,  housing  and

healthcare  needs.  It differs in main  from  some  other

social  security  systems principally because  the  money

that  goes  in does not get pooled together with  others.

It  is not an insurance system.  The money belongs to the

account  holder for his use.  He has direct ownership  of

it.   With that, there is also the sense that the  money,

which is contributed into the account by his employer, is

rightfully part of his salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have liberalised the use of CPF

funds.   Singaporeans are now able to ostensibly  enhance

the  value  of their funds in their CPF accounts  and  to

meet  certain social needs as well.  We were  liberal  in

allowing  Singaporeans to use their CPF  funds,  for  the

substantial  purchase  value  of  their  properties,  for

investments  in trustee shares, where unfortunately,  for

many CPF account holders, I am not sure if they know  the

difference  between a share and a bond.  In other  words,

the liberal tendency towards the use of CPF funds meant a

basic  and  fundamental shift in  looking  at  CPF  as  a

practically safe and secure savings scheme for old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raises the question of the amount that one

needs  for old age.  At the moment, the Minimum Sum  that

one  needs  to  maintain in his CPF Ordinary  Account  on

retirement  is  pegged at $80,000  in  the  coming  year.

While  this is a carefully calculated sum, one must  bear

in  mind  that  what  is  sufficient  is  relative.   For

Singaporeans generally, one would have thought that  what

is  sufficient or basic, is a function of the quality and

standard  of living and, of course, relative to the  cost

of  living  then.   To my mind, Sir, it would  seem  that

there  would  always be some anxiety that  no  amount  of

savings would seem

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>

enough to provide for retirement.  One would suppose that

liberalising  the use of CPF funds for certain  types  of

investments  was meant to enlarge the pool of  retirement

funds available for the CPF account holder. This is  well

and  fine  in  an economic environment where  the  growth

indicators seem to defy the laws of gravity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nobody expected the world economy to look

so  dismal,  neither did anybody expect  property  prices

here  ever to head south.  Well, this has happened.   For

many  Singaporeans, this has meant that  there  is  asset

deflation  and  with that, a dramatic  reduction  in  the

value of their CPF funds.  The most obvious example would

be  the total amount that some Singaporeans pay for their

residential  property.  At the end of the  day  this  may

well exceed 160% in value.  And for many Singaporeans, it

would  also  mean  that  a substantial  amount  of  their

savings  could  also  be  wiped out  if  property  prices

continue  to depreciate in value from the height  of  the

property   boom.  This  is  not  to  mention  that   many

Singaporeans who use their CPF savings to buy shares  are

also badly hit recently because of falling share prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background of a mix of pressing demands

of  old age, a more liberal and perhaps a more risky  use

of  CPF funds and an uncertain economic future, there  is

an even greater need for Singaporeans to save more rather

than  less  for old age; which explains why  our  savings

rate, even at present, is pegged at one of the highest in

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this savings contribution to CPF, at the

moment,  coming from both the employer and  employee,  is

now  seen as one of the main impediments towards  getting

Singaporeans employed or to stay employed.   It  is  also

depriving many Singaporeans in the lower income band from

using  their cash immediately since their money must  now

be squirrelled away to their accounts in CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore try to fix the problem, at least for

the older Singaporeans in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>

50-55 age group category, by getting a relative reduction

of  the  employer's contribution to 16%.  For the  poorer

Singaporeans  making less than $500 a month,  we  try  to

help them by not requiring them to put their share of the

contribution  to the CPF account.  In other words,  there

is  no need for them to save for old age, since they  are

facing enough difficulties for the moment to think  about

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I can understand where the changes are

coming  from, I do have some reservations about them.   I

shall  touch on two.  Forgive me if I dwell on the  issue

of CPF contributions of those in the 50-55 age group.   I

would  also  touch  on  the CPF contributions  of  poorer

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF contributions for the older

Singaporeans in that category.  The underlying  rationale

on  the reduction of CPF contribution is to enable  older

Singaporeans to become more employable, either in getting

employed  or  staying employed.  What the revisions  will

lead  to  ultimately is that when CPF contribution  rates

are revised upwards, there will be no change for those in

that age group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do have reservations about tweaking with CPF

contribution  rate  even  if the  underlying  concern  is

employment among older Singaporeans. When we started  the

CPF  system for Singaporeans, it was, as I understand it,

meant  to  deal  with an issue that the market  will  not

resolve  effectively,  and that is getting  employees  to

save  for  retirement.  In its implementation, therefore,

the  CPF  system was generally applied across the  board,

irrespective of age, physical ability or gender.  We have

acknowledged that the CPF, as a pension system, or  as  a

social  safety net, has worked fairly well to-date.   For

one,  there  is  certainty in the wage  outlay  for  both

employers and employees.  Presently, the CEOs, the  human

resource managers and financial controllers calculate the

total  wage bill of the organisation in relation also  to

the  rate  that they have to contribute to CPF. Decisions

to  employ  any  employee are left very  much  to  market

forces.   Often  the  question to hire  any  employee  is

dependent on the ability of the person concerned and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>

his asking wages.  Again, the decision whether or not  to

keep  any  employee on the payroll is determined  by  his

contribution to the company and his cost to the  company.

Market forces leave the question of the amount to be paid

as  wages  to the parties to negotiate.  In the  case  of

those who are already employed, in as much as salaries go

up,  salaries  must also be reduced if that  is  what  it

takes  to  keep  employment.   Often,  CPF  contributions

merely provide the framework within which negotiation  of

wages takes place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must realise that by tweaking with the

present  system, we are, in effect, moving from  that  of

facilitating   the   operation  of   market   forces   to

introducing elements that would directly impinge  on  the

operation  of market forces itself.  In other words,  the

change  in  policy would hopefully lead to  making  older

Singaporeans more attractive to the employer. What we are

doing  is,  in  my  opinion, no  different  from  setting

legislation that requires employers to give reduction  in

salary to older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am given to understand that in Singapore, we

should,  where  possible,  leave  it  to  the  market  to

determine  the supply of goods and services.  Legislative

intervention should not be introduced in the  marketplace

if  possible and should be put in place only where market

forces fail.  It is for this reason that we have resisted

the  idea  of minimum wages in our legislation,  lest  an

inefficient   and  imperfect  market  be  created.    The

institution of the CPF is to compel savings and not as an

inducement  to hire any particular group.   By  adjusting

the  contribution rate of the elderly,  we  have  made  a

fundamental shift, fundamental in a sense that  we  have,

by  legislation,  set wage levels to induce  hiring.   If

true,  if  I  may  ask, are we going back  on  the  basic

economic  principle of using the marketplace to determine

the level of supply and demand?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as was originally put, the concern was getting

older  Singaporean workers to gain employment or to  stay

employed, surely the approach could well have been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>

to  encourage  older  workers to  accept  lower  starting

salaries  or to accept lower wages, if that  is  what  it

takes  to  keep  them employed.  Having a  culture  where

older  workers  are prepared to lower their  wages  to  a

level that meets the demand at the marketplace would,  to

my  mind,  be  a more realistic approach towards  dealing

with  the issue of the unemployed middle-aged.  Like many

of  my  colleagues before me, I do not think for a moment

that  the  4-percentage point reduction on  the  employer

side is going to make much of a difference in helping the

employer  decide on the issue.  Neither will the  savings

in  CPF  contribution prevent an older worker from  being

retrenched.  The point is, if you are good, you are good,

irrespective of age.  Also, if the company's business  is

faring  badly, cutting CPF contribution is not  going  to

make   a  difference.   And  I  suspect  that  even   the

Government is not sure whether reducing the rate  of  CPF

contribution by the employer is going to help save jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, cutting CPF rates across the board for the

older  workers is akin to using a blunt instrument for  a

surgical  operation.  By a stroke of the pen, it  affects

all employees who fall into the category, irrespective of

whether they are effective, efficient or productive.  The

question  which  should legitimately be  asked  by  those

affected is why should those who are capable be  made  to

suffer for those who are not as able to get a job or  are

about  to lose their jobs.  Is the Government being  fair

to these people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than embark on a policy that has no certainty

of  saving  jobs or getting jobs for older  workers,  and

telling  employers  to  pass  the  savings  back  to  the

employees,   perhaps  the  Government   should   consider

adopting  the  approach of encouraging older  workers  to

accept lower wages to make themselves competitive at  the

marketplace  and  perhaps  to continue  to  emphasise  on

training  and retraining to upgrade the skills  of  these

workers.   This  approach has the  advantage  of  leaving

wages  to  be  determined efficiently by the marketplace,

and thus avoid the application of a blunt instrument that

has the effect of throwing the baby out with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>

bath water.  Additionally, the Government should consider

tax benefits for enlightened companies to hire or keep on

their payroll older employees.  The use of tax incentives

gives  a more positive edge to the solution, rather  than

the choice of CPF reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other concern. Today, we allow the CPF

contribution  rate for the older workers  to  be  reduced

because  we  think  that this will help with  employment.

Does  that mean that the Government in future is prepared

to  recognise  other  categories of  employees  as  well?

Would the Government, say, lower the CPF contribution for

the  disabled  to make them more employable?   Would  the

Government   increase   the  contribution   for   foreign

employees to create a more level playing field between  a

local  and  foreign  employee?  The point  is,  making  a

special exception for any particular category of employee

may  be  creating a precedent that may well open  up  the

floodgates for the others.  Once we allow this,  it  will

be  easy to see how easily this may be opened up to other

possibilities as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to my second point and that is, very

briefly, compelling the poor to save.  Our CPF system  is

targetted at those in the category of 10th percentile and

the  80th percentile.  What this translates into is  that

the  poor Singaporeans in the relevant category will  not

benefit substantially from the most important form of the

safety net when they retire.  The proposed policy of  not

compelling Singaporeans whose income is below  a  certain

benchmark of $500 a month to save is, in effect, aimed at

helping them to improve their cash flow.  However,  while

the  intention  is  well meaning,  the  larger  issue  is

whether such a move really helps them in the longer term.

The  truth of the matter is that by allowing them not  to

contribute to their CPF account, the Government may  just

be  postponing the problem for them.  How are they  going

to  provide for themselves when they retire?  It does not

look like the State can avoid the issue of the welfare of

these  Singaporeans, many of whom, through  no  fault  of

their own, are caught

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>

up in this situation.  And because they are Singaporeans,

it  is our duty and responsibility to carry them, whether

presently or for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept this responsibility, I would suggest

that  the  Government help these poorer  Singaporeans  to

build   up   their    CPF  accounts  by  making   monthly

contributions on their behalf.  This move has the benefit

of  giving  those Singaporeans a sense of  security  that

there will always be a place at the dining table for them

even  if  they  are  poor.  It does  not  give  out  cash

directly  and thus avoid the problem of potential  abuse.

But  for future Singaporeans, it will be fairer for  them

as  we  will  not be passing the problems of the  present

generation for them to shoulder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the weekend, I attended the Remaking of

Singapore  retreat.  During the retreat, a  question  was

raised  as to what our vision for the future of Singapore

is.   Sir,  that question sets many of us thinking.   For

many,  defining the future vision for Singapore as a  set

piece  against  a broad canvas is not something  that  we

have  given serious consideration to.  All of us gathered

here  in  this House do have a vague notion.  I  am  sure

that  the future Singapore that we want will be  a  place

where  we  can  pursue  happiness,  fraternity,  freedom,

equality and justice and ideals which can be carried  out

in  an  environment  that seeks  to  maximise  the  human

potential that every Singaporean is endowed with.  Beyond

those  ideals,  we  are not very clear.   Perhaps  it  is

evolving all the time.  However, what I am clear about is

that future Singapore must not be a place where the older

Singaporeans feel that they are second-class citizens  by

virtue  of  their  age, and because they  can  no  longer

effectively contribute to the economy.  I am  also  clear

that  future  Singapore must not be a  place  where  poor

Singaporeans feel that they have to eat out of the  hands

of fellow Singaporeans, and be made to feel the part of a

grateful supplicant.  What we must not do is to  rob  any

class of Singaporeans of their sense of dignity and self-worth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if at the end of the day, policies - not just

policies pertaining to the changes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>

to  the  CPF  -  would result in any Singaporean  feeling

less  than  worthy,  then I feel that Singapore  and  all

Singaporeans will be poorer for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

the  recommendation by the Economic Review  Committee  to

refocus   the   CPF  system  on  retirement  expenditure,

healthcare  and  home ownership is timely,  perhaps  even

overdue.  It is hard to argue against the principles  set

out  in  the  report.  But we have to be very careful  in

their  implementation, as any change to  the  CPF  system

would naturally lead to changes in the flow of funds into

or  out of properties and could have a significant impact

on  the  property  market,  public as  well  as  private.

Therefore,  we should not make changes to the CPF  system

without considering the necessary changes that should  be

carried  out in the HDB property market, which represents

more  than 85% of all household units within our  shores.

To  do  one  without the other could lead to adverse  and

undesirable consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to focus on the proposed changes

arising from the review of HDB's market rate loans and to

supplement  some of the points brought up earlier  by  Mr

Ravindran,  Mr Andy Gan and Dr Lily Neo, as I think  this

will   have  far-reaching  consequences.   I  have  three

concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has all along been a monopolistic supplier

of affordable housing for the masses.  One of the reasons

Singaporeans buy HDB flats is the safety net it  provides

in  bad times.  People look to the Government for shelter

and,  in Singapore, the Government is expected to provide

a  roof  over  our heads.  Section 51 of the Housing  and

Development Act provides that no HDB flat shall  vest  in

the  Official Assignee on the bankruptcy of the Singapore

citizen owner, and no HDB flat shall be attached  in  the

execution  of  a  decree of any court.    Now,  with  the

proposed  move by the HDB to discontinue granting  market

rate  mortgage loans, HDB flat buyers will have no choice

but   to   obtain  such  loans  from  private  commercial

financial   institutions.   My  concern  is   that   when

repayment is in arrears at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>

times   of   difficulties,  these  commercial   financial

institutions  will  be  tougher,  less  sympathetic   and

faceless in forcing the disposal of the HDB flat compared

to  the HDB.  This will lead to an increase in the number

of  people who will be made homeless without a roof  over

their heads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a small matter. For the year 2001,

the number of bankruptcy orders issued was 3,247, and  in

the  first  five months of this year, 1,457 persons  were

declared bankrupt.  Under the present system, if  someone

owns  an HDB flat and has difficulties servicing his  HDB

loan repayment, he can approach the HDB for the repayment

to  be  rescheduled and his creditors  cannot  touch  his

flat.  He can continue to own his HDB flat and his family

members can continue to live in it, even when he is  made

a  bankrupt.  With the changes to the rules, if the  loan

for  his  HDB  flat is from a commercial bank,  his  flat

would   be   forced  sold  as  part  of  the   bankruptcy

proceedings, and he and his family members would be  left

without shelter.  I would like to ask DPM where can  such

a  family  turn to.  What are the options  open  to  him?

This  is  a  fundamental change in the structure  of  our

housing  safety net, and one that we should not undertake

lightly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an affordable rental housing market that

those  in  need can turn to?  If not, how can  we  create

one?   I understand it is the HDB's intention not  to  be

the  provider of subsidised rental flats in  a  big  way.

And  under the present rules, HDB owners are not  allowed

to   sublet  their  flats  unless  under  very   specific

situations.   So, where are the affordable  rental  flats

going  to come from, if not from the HDB and the existing

pool of HDB flats?  I would like to urge the HDB to relax

its   rules  on  subletting,  as  this  must  surely   be

consequential  to  its decision not to continue  granting

market rate loans.  I cannot see how the HDB can say to a

HDB  flat buyer, you must get your loan from a commercial

bank  and  bear the risk of being evicted if you default,

and  yet  not  allow the owner to rent out his  flat  for

extra  income, or to order his life in such a way that he

would be able to meet his financial obligations.  But, on

the other hand, if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>

rental of HDB flats is relaxed and a large number of  HDB

flats  is  suddenly released into the rental market,  the

impact  on  the  private property rental market  will  be

tremendous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another HDB rule that has to be reviewed is

that  the  buyer of a resale flat cannot resell the  flat

within the 30-month minimum occupation period.  Now, what

if  a  buyer  had taken a market rate loan and,  say,  12

months later, he could not afford to service the loan due

to  a change in his financial circumstances?  Can he sell

the  flat  to  lower his financial burden?   Can  he  buy

another  and smaller resale flat?  Previously,  the  flat

owner could go to the HDB and reschedule his repayment if

he has financial difficulties.  In future, the commercial

bank  is  not going to be so  understanding nor  patient,

and  may even impose very punitive default interest  rate

which  applies  when the borrower is in  arrears  on  his

repayment.   The  flat owner will then be caught  between

the  devil and the deep blue sea.  Therefore, if we  want

to  go  the free market way for mortgage loans,  then  we

should  also  go the full haul and such HDB  restrictions

should be removed totally or relaxed significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next concern is about the change to give the

mortgagee  bank  the first charge over  the  property  in

priority to the CPF Board.  The present system where  the

CPF  Board has the first charge and the sale proceeds  of

the  property would first go to the CPF member's  account

to  satisfy any withdrawals made and interest that  would

have been earned, has been with us for many years and has

served  us well.   I say this because although  the  bank

has  a  second  charge, the borrower still  has  personal

liabilities  to  the  creditor bank  to  meet  fully  any

shortfall in the repayment.  So, if the outstanding  bank

loan  is  $600,000 and the property is sold for $800,000,

but  $300,000  has  to  go  back  to  CPF,  the  borrower

continues to be indebted to the bank for the shortfall of

$100,000.   And  the bank will sue and enforce  for  that

amount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we reverse the order, and the borrower owes

CPF Board the $100,000,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>

how  will the CPF Board enforce for the money to be  paid

into  the member's CPF account?  Will the CPF Board  make

him  a  bankrupt?  This being the case,  with  CPF  Board

being a less "tough" creditor compared to a bank, I  fear

that buyers of property will become more adventurous  and

take  more  risk  than necessary in deciding  to  make  a

property  purchase.  Somehow, people still do  not  quite

treat their CPF money as their own money, and they do not

feel the pinch so much when they lose it or spend it.   A

clear  example is Medisave.  People have no qualms  about

being  warded  in  expensive  private  hospitals  if  the

expenses can be deducted from their Medisave account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next point is about reverse mortgage. I

know  this issue has been discussed on many occasions  in

the  past,  but  I think it is worth revisiting  at  this

juncture.  The intention of the proposed changes  to  the

CPF  system  is to refocus on three areas  -   retirement

expenditure, healthcare and home ownership, and  also  to

fix the relative proportions of these three sub-accounts.

In the past, many people had over committed in properties

and  are now left with proportionately insufficient funds

for adequate healthcare and retirement expenditure.  This

could  also be caused by unexpected illnesses  that  have

led  to  an  increase  in medical  expenses.   I  believe

reverse  mortgage  is one way to realign  the  respective

proportions  and  allow the CPF account holder  to  shift

some  of  his funds that are locked in the HDB flat  into

funds  that  are  available for  medical  and  retirement

expenses.  I would like to urge the Government to  review

its policy on reverse mortgage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subject to the above concerns being considered,

I support the changes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I agree with the views of Mr Matthias Yao.   It  is

always  better  to  resolve a  minor  problem  before  it

evolves   into  a  major  one.  Let  me   give   you   an

illustration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, I injured a finger while playing

volleyball. I thought it was nothing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>

serious  and simply applied some traditional medicine  on

it.  But three weeks later, it became swollen.  I had  to

see  a  specialist.   After  an  X-ray  examination,  the

specialist  said that it was not a very serious  problem,

but it would take another six weeks before it would heal.

I  had  to wear this cap on the injured finger and it  is

very  troublesome.  The specialist also told me that  had

I  consulted  him earlier, say, within one  week  of  the

injury,   he  would have cured it in a  few  days'  time.

This example shows that if you have any problem, you must

first try to understand it as early as possible and  find

the  correct  solution for it.  So, when  we  talk  about

future  economic development, we have the Economic Review

Committee (ERC) established to look into it, and the  ERC

recently made some recommendations concerning changes  to

our existing CPF system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the announcement was made, I went on my

usual  round to the coffeeshops to hear the views of  the

public. This time round, the reaction is not as strong as

the  time when the transport fare hike was announced.  No

doubt,  there are some discussions about the CPF changes.

But  our people are generally very rational in trying  to

understand  and  accept the changes  to  the  CPF.   Some

residents feel that these changes are timely; while  some

still have doubts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Parliament sitting, we debated on the

fare  increases, and the feeling was that the  people  of

Singapore  were beginning to show concern for    national

issues.   The people are watching, and they do  not  miss

any changes that the Government proposes to make. This is

good!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two views on this. First, they support

the  recommendations  of the ERC.  At  present,  if  your

monthly  income is $200 and above, you have to contribute

to  CPF.   But now, you do not have to do so unless  your

income  is   $500 and above. This means the  lower-income

people  would have more in terms of take-home  pay.  This

recommendation has the support of the people.  This  will

help those who do temporary work and odd jobs.  They like

it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>

because  they will now have more cash to take home  every

month.  At this bad time, this change is a piece of  good

news to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, this will also help those people

who  are  unemployed and are looking for  jobs.   At  the

moment, when jobs are not so easily available, they  will

be  more prepared to accept lower-paid jobs, because they

do  not have to deduct money from their pay to contribute

to  CPF. Psychologically, they will find the lower  wages

more acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some residents who have a different

view.   For  those  in the age group between  50-55,  the

employers' CPF contribution will be frozen at  16%.   The

proposal is based on two points.  One is to encourage the

companies to employ older workers and, secondly, to lower

the  labour cost to keep the business viable and for  the

workers to keep their jobs.  Theoretically, it is a  very

good  policy and measure.  But, in reality, is it  really

so?   Singapore  is a pragmatic society.  Many  employers

and  companies employ people according to the  cost  they

have  to  bear. The meagre 4% saving on CPF  contribution

makes  very  little difference to them.  For example,  to

employ  a fresh university graduate with a pay of $3,000,

20% CPF means the company has to pay $600.  But for a 52-year  old  senior  officer who is paid  $5,000,  16%  CPF

amounts to $800. The total wage cost is still higher than

that   of  the  fresh  graduate.   There  is  not  enough

incentive for the employer to take in older workers  when

they can get better qualified and more productive younger

workers at a lower cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this measure will not be very effective.

These older workers started working when they were young.

They have made great contributions to the company to  lay

the   foundation  of  the  company.   Such  efforts   and

contributions should not be ignored.  In the world, there

are many, many 50-year old people who are very important.

So,  we cannot deem a worker to be less productive or too

expensive the moment they turn 50.  As a matter of  fact,

to many great people, life begins at 50.  Take China, for

example,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>

most,  if  not all, their leaders took on top  leadership

position  only when they were over 50 years of age.  Even

our very own Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was 50 when  he

took over the helm to become the second generation leader

to lead Singapore into more prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who are aged between 50 and 55

now  is  quite big, because they are the ones born during

the baby boom years after the second World War. They have

gone  through  various stages of our nation building  and

have   rendered   meritorious   contributions   to    the

development of Singapore.  Without such people, Singapore

would  not  have  been so successful and  so  prosperous,

economically and socially.  In community services,  those

in  the age group of 50 to 55 are the most active.   They

take  part in various community activities and contribute

tremendously to the future of Singapore.  They are a very

important group of people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the new generation of citizens

are  getting  married late, between 26 and  28.   At  50,

their  children  will be about 18 to 20  years  old,  and

attending   polytechnic  or  university.   The  financial

burden peaks around this time, at between 50 and 55.   To

cut  their CPF amounts to cutting their income, and  that

will undoubtedly enhance their financial burden. This  is

a   very  important  issue  which  the  people  are  very

concerned with.  In order to solve this problem,  Dr  Low

Seow  Chay asked whether, during the bad times we reduced

CPF  contribution  rate to 16%, and when times are  good,

do  we  not have the moral obligation to have it restored

to 20 percentage points?  So, every few years, we have to

make some adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NTUC has also raised the issue of flexible

wage  system.   I  think this is a good system  and  many

companies  are  adopting  the  new  system.   I  am  just

thinking whether we can also have a flexible CPF  scheme,

ie,  between age 50 and 55, the CPF contribution rate can

range from 16% to 20%, and companies,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>

which  are able to gauge the contribution and performance

of  their employees, can decide how much to pay for their

respective employees' CPF.  If this employee can  make  a

lot  of money for the company, why should the company cut

down  the  CPF by 4 percentage points?  In this  way,  it

will allow the company more flexibility in making the CPF

contributions,  and that will encourage  the  workers  to

work  harder and do better.  The companies will therefore

have  more  autonomy to exercise their  own  judgment  to

decide  on  how  much CPF contributions  to  pay  to  the

individual  workers.  We should not fix the rate  at  16%

across-the-board.   There may  be  100  people  or  1,000

people working in the company. They cannot have the  same

level  of performance.  So, we should  allow the  company

to  decide  on its own.  But the Government  now  decides

that  for age 50 to 55, the company has the right to  fix

the  CPF at 16%.  I think that the ERC should revisit its

decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about HDB's proposal to transfer

the  housing loans to the banks.  There is a  rule  which

says  that if the people want to downgrade from a  bigger

flat  to a smaller flat, they cannot borrow from the HDB.

So,  they  must  borrow from the bank.  Now,  HDB  allows

every  citizen to buy two flats, ie, a small 3-room  flat

or  to  upgrade from a 3-room flat to a 4-room or  5-room

flat.   So they will have two opportunities to enjoy  the

subsidies from HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a citizen started off with a 3-room flat and then

upgraded  to a 4-room or 5-room flat, when he  grows  old

and all his children are married and not living with him,

then  he  would find that he does not need the bigger  4-room or 5-room flat.  Now, he wants to downgrade to a  3-room or smaller flat.  But, he cannot borrow from the HDB

and  has  to borrow from the bank.  By that time, because

of  financial  difficulty due to  economic  downturn,  he

would have to sell his bigger flat to buy a smaller  one.

In  those  circumstances, he would still have  to  borrow

from  the  bank.  But banks are commercial  institutions.

If  you are old and have financial difficulties, then  it

is  unlikely  that the bank will lend any money  to  you.

This will become a major problem for the old citizens.  I

would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>

suggest  that the HDB be more flexible towards the  older

citizens,   particularly  those  who  are  in   financial

difficulties.  When they need to borrow money, then  they

should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I support the Statement of Deputy Prime

Minister Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, drastic

times  call for drastic measures.  In all the years  that

Singapore has been governed by the PAP Government,  I  am

glad  to note that we have not shied away from tough  but

necessary measures.  The recommendations of the ERC,  led

by  Mr Tharman, and what DPM Lee had announced today  are

no  different.  Though I agree and support  the  measures

introduced,  what we have heard are fundamental  paradigm

shifts in the way we organise Singapore.  Paradigm shifts

are  very subjective to judgment.  Who would have thought

that  when we introduced the stop-at-two family  planning

policy  more  than  30 years ago, we would  have  runaway

success  rates so much so that we are facing  procreation

problems instead?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, Sir, the net result of the changes

introduced  today  is  the shift  of  greater  individual

citizen  responsibility.  Allow me to highlight one  such

change and its possible consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raising of income floor from $200 to $500 would

be beneficial and encouraging to part-time workers.  Sir,

I  am concerned, however, that the lifting of the monthly

salary of an employee not liable for CPF contribution  to

$500  might be negative on our low-income home  ownership

scheme.   I am aware that this change would result  in  a

worker  earning  $500 or less having more  money  in  his

pocket.   Hence, if he wants a flat of his  own,  he  now

would have to put more money aside from his take-home pay

every  month for this purpose.  However, this is an ideal

situation.  Our home ownership in the last 10  years  has

not  changed much.  The percentage of the rental  section

of  the population remains persistently at 10% of the HDB

population.  This is despite the fact that in the last 10

years or so, income

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>

has  gone  up  and  the  trend  in  property  is  towards

upgrading, and there are also Government measures to help

them  own  their own place.  Yet, the percentile  remains

where they are all these years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to the Government to consider softening the

requirements  for the low-income group to own  their  own

homes,  perhaps by reducing the deposits even further  to

5%.   Also,  I  do call upon the Government  to  step  up

public  education on individual financial management  and

to  further educate the virtues and importance of  saving

for rainy days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me go to my second point. In some academic

circles,  there  is a view that Taiwanese  or  Hong  Kong

Chinese, when faced with economic difficulties,  rely  on

themselves to survive.  Singaporeans, on the other  hand,

when  faced with a difficult situation, would ask:   What

is  the  Government going to do about it?  Our  Northeast

Asian  neighbours'  resilience  can  be  seen  from   the

hundreds  of  thousands of savvy Taiwanese businesses  in

mainland China.  This is despite the restriction  imposed

by  the  Taiwanese  government  and  other  communication

difficulties.   There  are also reports  that  Hong  Kong

unemployed  are  quick on the mend to  take  up  jobs  in

mainland China, which they previously shunned in order to

survive.   Singaporeans, on the other hand, look  to  the

Government  for  solutions or directions when  confronted

with a difficult situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I wish to make is with reference

to  the recommendations of the ERC to enhance the returns

of  the CPF balances through more varieties of investment

instruments,  including  the low-cost,  low-risk  pension

plans.  I am fully in support of this move of introducing

the  low-risk pension plans.  However, I am also  of  the

view  that  at present, there are too many types  of  CPF

pension funds and it is confusing to Singaporeans.  There

are  the many Henderson funds, three or five arrow Japan,

US  or  European growth funds, technology-related  funds,

and  so  on.   Do  we think our average Singaporeans  are

economically savvy enough to make an informed choice when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>

investing  their  CPF  balances?  I  think  not,  as  the

percentage  of the people using their CPF  to  invest  in

stocks  and  shares and making money is a dismal  10%  or

less.  While I laud the ERC's intent to boost the returns

of  Singaporeans' CPF monies, I would urge the Government

to  educate  the  public on investing  their  CPF  monies

wisely.  This is to echo what hon. Member Mrs Yu-Foo  Yee

Shoon  has  mentioned earlier on.  Otherwise, instead  of

boosting  their  retirement nest, they  might  have  lost

everything,  for  example,  if  they  have  invested   in

technology-related funds earlier on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to raise a point on the reversal

of   charge  position.   The  stated  intention  of   the

recommendation of the ERC is to allow for Singaporeans to

have more monies themselves when they retire, instead  of

depending on their children.  However, by allowing  banks

to  be  the  first  creditor, instead of  the  CPF,  runs

contrary to the stated intention.  This is because, as  I

have  highlighted earlier on, Singaporeans are  dependent

on the Government and not investment savvy enough.  Thus,

they  might not have known the full risk involved in real

estate  investment  and indulge  in  it  with  their  CPF

monies.   When banks have the first go, there  is  almost

not  much left to be returned back to the CPF when things

go  wrong.  I am afraid the public might be lured by  the

prospect of profitable property speculations and overlook

the  risk  involved.   The prospect  of  one  losing  his

retirement nest is real.  Is the Government educating the

public  adequately?   I call on the Government  for  more

efforts   in   educating  the  public  in  more   prudent

investments and the managing of their savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I applaud the tough but necessary

measures.   However, in this paradigm shift, I  urge  the

Government to adequately educate Singaporeans,  not  only

the  educated  but also particularly the lesser  educated

Singaporeans, on the duties of greater individual citizen

responsibility.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the

debate on CPF changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF is a highly sensitive issue. In 1984 when

the  issue  of CPF withdrawal age was discussed,  it  was

almost  explosive.   The Howe Yoon Chong  Report  on  the

Committee on the Problems of the Aged was almost derailed

when  Singaporeans were not ready for its recommendations

to  change the withdrawal age of CPF balance from  55  to

60, and then 65.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for any potentially

explosive  subject, it is a matter of T&T (treatment  and

timing).  Not only must one package and present it  well,

timing must also be right.  Judging from the reaction  we

have  heard  about  the  ERC's  recommendations  and  the

endorsement expected and now confirmed by DPM, I  believe

we  are  doing all right.  Allow me, Sir, to congratulate

the  ERC for a job well done.  The press briefing,  which

Senior Minister of State Tharman Shanmugaratnam and   the

team  had,  was excellent.  And they practically  covered

all the areas, including the concerns felt by the public.

Even  my  trade union friends spoke well of the treatment

given  by  the  ERC, especially when they  addressed  the

expected concerns of the labour force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF had for a long time been seen as a sacred

cow  in  preserving  our ideals of democratic  socialism.

But  true  to Singapore's pragmatic approach to  policies

and  changing realities, even the CPF had been  subjected

to many changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many MPs yesterday celebrated Racial Harmony

Day  and, for some, it might be considered as insensitive

to  talk  about  slaughtering sacred cows.   But  let  me

assure you that, even in Islam, when in real emergencies,

even pork is considered halal than Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This latest round of changes again reaffirms

Singapore's  confidence on our system  of  governance  in

willing   to   make   bold   changes,   when   necessary.

Singaporeans should take note of the signal sent  out  by

the  changes  and  make  their own  preparation  for  the

uncertainties of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>

the   future  challenges,  as  emphasised  by  DPM.   The

decision  not to restore fully the CPF rate  for  workers

aged  50-55  is  one  example.   It  must  be  a  painful

decision, but it must surely be more painful to lose your

jobs compared to a reduction in pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, there will be those who would look

at  this decision as a breach of trust, as the Government

has  promised to restore CPF for all.  But for those  who

feel  that way, I would like to urge them to please think

again  the  employment problems facing the age group  are

real  and  better  to  be  realistic  than  to  lose  out

altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I would like to share the

sentiments  expressed by hon. Member Halimah  Yacob  that

employers  pay deserving workers between the ages  of  50

and  55 either in the form of monthly variable component,

or  bonus.  Similarly, I would also like to call  on  the

Government  to give CPF top-ups, or Singapore Shares,  to

such  affected groups of people when the economy permits.

Singaporeans  should  also  welcome  Government's  caring

initiative   to  implement  a  Transitional  CPF   Top-up

Component (TCTC) for civil servants aged 50-55, such that

when CPF is restored for the others, they will receive in

the  TCTC part of what they would have received had their

CPF been restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge the companies which could

afford  such  measures to implement them for their  staff

and  win  better loyalty and productivity.  Nevertheless,

the  underlying point worth emphasising is that times are

changing and whether for the 50-55 age group, or  younger

workers, training and retraining are cornerstones workers

need  to  pay special heed to.  Especially for the  40-50

age   group,  they  should  be  thankful  that  the   CPF

restoration  is possible, but do take a serious  look  at

their skills level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad the Government has

decided  to extend the SRP and PJTP training schemes.   I

feel  that DPM should consider extending the schemes  not

only  till 31st October 2003, but for at least two years.

The problems of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>

employability for the not-so-young will be  with  us  for

some time and they will need continued help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the many changes recommended for CPF

and   other  related  areas,  particularly,  housing  and

healthcare,  are  well meaning.  But  in  the  nature  of

changes,  the  Government should monitor the consequences

of  those changes and make necessary adjustments after  a

period of time, say, six months later, after experiencing

the  results and outcome of these changes.  As the saying

goes,  "The  only more painful experience  learning  from

experience is not to learn from experience."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the statement on CPF and related changes,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, despite

hon. Member Mr Matthias Yao's attempt earlier to redirect

Members' interest to other subjects in the debate,  I  am

afraid  I remain rather fixated on the proposal  to  keep

the  employer's CPF contribution to 16% for workers  aged

50-55 years.  Let me say that DPM, Mdm Halimah Yacob  and

Mr  Yao  have all talked about the concerns that we  have

for  the  older, lower skilled workers.   Myself  and,  I

think,  many  other  Members who have  spoken  before  me

recognise  that it is a concern and that  it  needs  some

urgent  attention.  We recognise that  this  proposal  to

lower  the  employer's contribution  rate  is  a  sincere

attempt to address the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not convinced that this is an appropriate

or  an  effective solution.  So the argument is not about

the  fact that there is a problem.  The argument is about

whether  or not this is really going to be effective,  in

fact,  whether it will be counter-productive.   Companies

will  continue  to  hire  and  employ  workers  who   are

productive  and make useful contributions, regardless  of

their  age.   Companies will not employ workers  who  are

unable  to  get  the  job  done,  regardless  of  the  4%

discount,  so to speak, on their CPF cost.  All  that  we

are  going  to  achieve with this move is to disadvantage

those productive workers in the 50-55 age range, who are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>

gainfully employed and make it harder for them  to  build

up their retirement nest egg.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we will further reinforce the

perception  and  the practice of treating  older  persons

universally  as  a  group,  as  being  worth   less   and

contributing  less.   Government has  said,  on  previous

occasions,  that we must move away from using  CPF  as  a

convenient but blunt instrument to lower cost in economic

hard times.  The Economic Review Sub-committee on CPF has

said  that  we  should refocus the  scheme  back  to  the

fundamentals  of providing for people's  basic  needs  in

their retirement.  And indeed, the other proposals,  such

as  restraining  the amount to be spent on  property  and

increasing  the Minimum Sum, are clearly  steps  in  this

direction.  But this proposal to cut the contributions of

50-55  year olds is slipping right back to the old  habit

of  using  CPF to fix a problem that should be addressed,

at source, in other ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root causes of the group of older workers having

difficulty  finding jobs lie, firstly, in their  lack  of

skills,  or  ability, or willingness  to  fill  available

jobs;  and, secondly, their relatively higher cost due to

our  seniority-based pay system.  The real  solutions  to

this  problem therefore involve reskilling these workers,

where  possible, and this has been covered at  length  in

terms  of  the efforts we are making in skills upgrading,

also  in  getting them to accept different kinds of  work

that Singaporeans currently find or think unattractive or

beneath  them, and also in getting companies to  look  at

redesigning jobs so that older workers are able to manage

in areas where physical strength is an issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next group of solutions would be pushing harder

to shorten salary scales and increasing performance-based

remuneration so that the factor of higher cost  of  older

workers due to the seniority-based system becomes a  non-issue.   These are the real solutions, not the convenient

quick-fix of holding back on CPF restoration.  Mr Yao and

Mdm Yacob have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>

talked  about the efforts that we have tried to  make  in

getting companies to address this to shorten those salary

scales,  and  that  it has been very tough.   My  concern

really  is that, if you take that pressure off by  taking

the easy route, and legislating CPF is actually very easy

-  we  have some debate on this in Parliament and at  the

end  of  the day, we go ahead and do it.  It is  an  easy

thing to do.  But it is not necessarily the right answer.

In  doing it, you are taking that pressure off constantly

pushing  to  really fix a fundamental problem,  which  is

those  seniority-based pay systems.  By  doing  this,  in

fact,  and  we  can  argue  about  the  effectiveness  or

otherwise,  it  is  counter-productive.   You  take   the

pressure  off,  people will stop and say,  "OK,  we  have

fixed  part of the problem. CPF for this group is  less."

So there is less pressure to go for the real root causes.

That, I think, is a concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has said that we will not neglect and continue

to  work  on  flexi  wage systems  and  skills  upgrading

programmes.  But these are the other things that if we do

not  have  the  pressure  on, I think  we  might  end  up

relaxing  a little bit or waiting for the next time  that

we  need  to  go  on for more CPF related  changes.   The

Committee  has said that these changes will  enhance  the

flexibility  of  our  overall wage  structure.   And  the

Committee has called upon companies to make up  to  their

productive older workers through variable bonus and other

such  payments.  I am not so sanguine that this is  going

to happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, how many Members of the House really believe

that  this is going to happen.  Productive older  workers

will  be rewarded in a good company with variable bonuses

and  such  in the same way as productive younger workers.

But they are not going to be selectively given more, just

to  make  up  for  the  CPF cut that the  Government  has

mandated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was a newspaper article on SingTech,

and here was one company which was supposedly saying they

would  respond.  The headline was very nice, and it said,

"SingTech to compensate older workers".  However, if  you

read the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>

content  of  that  article, basically  what  the  CEO  of

SingTech said was that good, older workers will  get  the

same  reward as the younger ones, not that they will  get

actually more, to compensate and make up for the CPF cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reiterate, CPF is a scheme to help people with

their retirement needs.  It is not a way to fix wage cost

problems  and it is not a way to enhance the  flexibility

of  wage  structure for workers.  Anything we do  through

legislation,  and CPF contribution rates are  legislated,

never   enhances   flexibility.   Legislation,   on   the

contrary, builds rigidity into the system.  Not  only  is

CPF  a  blunt instrument but, in this instance, it  is  a

wrong instrument.  I ask the Government to reconsider its

acceptance on this proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is

clear  to  us  that  the  main  objective  of  the   Sub-Committee's  recommendations  is  to  strike  a   balance

between  the social objective of ensuring adequate  funds

in  the  CPF  for retirees and the economic objective  of

maintaining  the cost competitiveness of  our  workforce.

Both  objectives are noble and enlightened ones and there

must be a flexible balance between them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, this balance could be shifted one

way  or the other without extracting an onerous price  on

the  part of the employees.  For example, in the  1986-87

recession, CPF rates, then standing at a hefty  50%  were

slashed  by  more  than  half, to  get  us  out  of  that

recession quickly and decisively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, those were the days when the cost of living

was  not  as  high as they are now.  A reduction  in  the

employer's contribution to the employee's CPF then  could

and  did  materially reduce business costs,  while  still

enabling workers to sustain themselves after retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, Sir, we are now caught in a conundrum,

not  mainly of this country's own making, but  for  which

lower-income  employees have to bear the  brunt  of  this

latest revision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that this conundrum is not of our own making

because I fully understand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>

the  imperative of keeping ourselves globally competitive

in an age when less developing countries are aggressively

challenging  us  for precious investment  dollars.   Wage

cost  is, of course, one part of the total business costs

that   investors  look  into  before  making   investment

decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the feedback of many is that, in re-juggling our CPF system to achieve wage competitiveness

in  our  labour  force,  one  group  of  workers  may  be

suffering the main burden of such an adjustment, that is,

those between 50-55 years old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee's recommendations to keep

employers'  contribution to 16%, while also reducing  the

employee's  contribution to 16%, is meant to  ensure  the

employability  of  this  group of  employees  in  a  more

competitive environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, many in this age bracket are faced with the

prospect of ever-increasing costs of living expenses over

the  longer  term.  They may get to enjoy a higher  take-home  pay  in  the shorter term, but over the  course  of

their  retirement  years,  with  employer's  contribution

capped at 16%, they may actually not have enough in their

accounts  to see them through to the end of their  lives.

It  has been advocated that reduction would make it  more

appealing for employers to retain the services  of  those

in  the  50-55  age group.  Employers will  not  have  to

retrench  them  in view of their higher costs.   However,

such a view has certain embedded assumptions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Sub-Committee is correct to assume that

most companies in Singapore are paying their staff on the

basis of a rigidified seniority-based grade system.   But

there  are also companies in Singapore that have  already

shifted  to  a performance-based system or a  competency-based one, according to which, age does not matter in the

determination of one's salary.  We should be  encouraging

more    companies    to    shift   to   performance-based

compensation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed reduction in the employer's

contribution rate to 16% -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>

when  younger age groups see theirs going  up  to  20%  - would  it  signal to the business sector that it  is  all

right to discriminate against older workers simply on the

basis  of  their  age?   If performance  is  what  really

matters, why should age be the basis on which some people

get less for doing the same, if not more, work than those

of the other age categories?  Furthermore, would not such

a  recommendation reinforce stereotypes  among  employers

that  older  employees are less productive  than  younger

ones?  How can we ensure that such a perception does  not

get ingrained into our system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is also the assumption that

companies  are driven to retrench these older workers  by

virtue  of the increase in business costs, as represented

by the employer's CPF contributions.  However, there have

been  some  voices emanating from respectable members  of

the   business  community  that  the  4-percentage  point

reduction,  by itself, is probably not sufficient  enough

to  make  a  major impact.  In other words, there  is  no

compelling  reason for us to assume that,  by  swallowing

this  bitter pill, older workers will automatically  face

better job prospects than before.  As we all know,  since

1999,  employer's CPF contribution rate for  all  workers

was  cut  to  16%  from the previous 20%.   Has  this  4-percentage  point reduction substantially contributed  to

increased prospects of employability for older workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Committee also cites the figure that out of

the 110,000 workers in the 50-55 age bracket, 11% are now

out  of  a job.  There might be other explanatory factors

that  account  for such a figure.  For example,  many  of

those  in  this  age  category  might  have  taken  early

retirement.  Furthermore, many in this age category might

not   possess  enough  skills,  knowledge  and  education

necessary for the new economy.  In other words, the  Sub-Committee's  assumption, that cost  is  the  main  factor

determining the employment prospects of these  employees,

may  be a dubious one.  While I believe that cost is  one

reason that affects the employment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>

prospects of older employees, it is one among many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the other crucial factors could include the

need  for retraining and upgrading the knowledge base  of

these  employees, the need to prevent age  discrimination

in  the work place, and the need to move towards a purely

performance-based salary system, one that  is  free  from

prejudices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a related matter, the Sub-Committee has also

recommended a reduction in the CPF Ordinary Account  rate

from  the present 22% for those aged 50-55 years to  14%.

This will mean that many people in this age category  may

have  difficulty servicing their housing loans,  as  less

money  would  be  available for investments  in  housing.

This could also substantially affect those in their 40s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, what other measures would the

Government  take  -  assuming  that  the  Sub-Committee's

proposals  are  accepted - to ensure that this  group  of

home-owners  would  not find themselves  in  a  situation

where they would have to default on their loans, or  find

it  difficult  to  cough up sufficient  cash  amounts  to

ensure their own serviceability?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on the impact of the

lowering  of the CPF contribution ceiling from $6,000  to

$5,000, many find themselves in a double-bind.  Not  only

will  they  see the employers' contribution to their  CPF

accounts  capped at the current 16% for the first  $5,000

they earn when every other age group see theirs going up,

they  will also be subject to zero contribution from  the

employers  for anything they earn above $5,000.   If  the

recommendations  are accepted in its entirety,  they  are

requesting that the Government also look into their needs

and  not  blithely  assume that they  can  take  care  of

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In raising the CPF wage bands from $200-363 to $500-750, we increase the take-home pay for the low-wage and

part-time  workers,  helping them to meet  their  current

needs and encouraging more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>

to   enter   the   workforce.   The   downside   of   the

recommendation  is  the  concern that  this  category  of

employees will have very little in their CPF.   It  would

be  very  difficult  to build up sufficiently  for  their

retirement, housing and health care, ie, for their future

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cap on the maximum use of CPF for housing is a

prudent recommendation, and the announcement of a pension

scheme to enhance the investment value of our CPF savings

gives a ray of hope for better yields.  It would be  good

for  public education to be mounted, so that CPF  members

are instructed and informed on how the scheme would work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calls for a fundamental shift in the mindset of

our  decision-makers and people.  The challenges  include

managing   the   mindset,   timing   and   readiness   of

implementation  of  the  recommendations  of   the   Sub-Committee.   The  revamp of the CPF is one  of  the  many

items in the remaking of Singapore.  We must not lose our

perspective when we experience change.  This is where  we

must  seek  a balance in handling differences and  coping

with  change.   Very often, we know that we are  besieged

with  both rational and emotive feelings that swing  like

pendulums  in  this whole exercise of remaking  Singapore

into  a  globally  competitive nation  of  resilient  and

entrepreneurial people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government should accept the recommendations,

it  is urgent for us to demonstrate our actions to assist

those  affected,  through  giving  them  a  channel   for

dialogue.   I  would  like  to  urge  the  Government  to

constantly  reinforce and encourage  employer  groups  to

share their gains from the cost savings.  Employer groups

must  be  conscious that they do not end  up  giving  lip

service and, on their own, to walk the talk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all NWC deliberations and recommendations, the

tripartite  parties must continue to urge employers,  who

could  well afford, to make up to the deserving  ones  in

the  above-50 age group for the difference in  their  CPF

contributions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal has advocated wage flexibility as a

reason  for the reduction in CPF but, in the same breath,

it  has  also  mentioned that CPF should not be  tinkered

further.   I  support  the  philosophy  of  having   wage

flexibility  for  a more viable business  operation  but,

where in the longer term it is necessary for us to review

the  CPF  rates  for reinstatement for this  category  of

people, we must not close the door there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rightly pointed out, we are concerned that

Singaporeans  may  not  have  enough  savings  for  their

retirement,   explaining  the   need   to   reverse   the

contribution  to 40% for those below 50.   Not  too  long

from now, the majority of our working population would be

in  the  above-50  age category.  With the  bulk  of  the

working population in the above-50 age group, it begs the

question whether they would be financially sufficient for

their  retirement needs and, therefore, a review  of  the

CPF may make sense.  Instead of using age as a factor for

CPF rate, company financial performance could be used  to

determine the CPF rate payable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if it makes sense to do so, the Government

could  facilitate  these  organisations  by  way  of  tax

incentives  in proportion to the number of  employees  in

the  age group of 50-55 who have been retained in service

or  are  being employed from among the unemployed.   Such

incentives would address the so-called wage costs of  the

50-55, without disrupting the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I agree that we want to nurture a resilient

group of people capable of looking after themselves  but,

at  the same time, while weaning off from mum's milk,  we

must also make available and accessible cow's milk.   For

example,  employers  must  be encouraged  to  mount  more

financial   planning  programmes  for   their   employees

reaching  50  years  of age, and more awareness  must  be

created  in financial planning for this group of  people.

In  this, perhaps the Government could also facilitate by

subsidising   and  supporting  such  financial   planning

programmes for the affected people.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEMES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Acting

Minister  for  Community Development and Sports  (a)  how

many  people  received  financial  assistance  under  the

various schemes in 2000, 2001 and the first six months of

this   year;  (b)  how  much  money  was  given  out   to

Singaporeans in need under each scheme; (c) what are  the

criteria used to assess candidates under each scheme; and

(d)  apart  from social workers, how are the  others  who

handle  such  cases trained to assess  cases  and  handle

matters of confidentiality.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs took over the administration of the social

assistance  schemes  and services from  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development and Sports with  effect  from  1st

April   2001.    The  CDCs  have  helped  almost   15,000

beneficiaries  with  financial  assistance  amounting  to

$14.99 million between April 2001 and March 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various schemes have specific eligibility

criteria to meet certain policy objectives.  For example,

a  beneficiary  under the Public Assistance  Scheme  must

satisfy  the  criteria  that he/she  is  unable  to  work

because of age, illness or disability and has no means of

subsistence as well as no one to depend on.  On the other

hand,  the  CDCs also administer the Interim (Short-Term)

Financial  Assistance Scheme (IFAS) where the  amount  of

assistance is based on Public Assistance rates, with each

case  assessed  on its own merits. The  officers  take  a

holistic  approach by looking at both the  individual  as

well  as  family circumstances before rendering the  most

appropriate form of assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides on-the-job training, the CDC officers

undergo training to equip them with the skills to  assess

and  handle applications for social assistance.  MCDS  is

also  organising a joint CDC-FSC training package  to  be

launched  in  August  2002 to strengthen  the  networking

between staff dealing with low-income families. The specific amounts disbursed under each scheme are

given in the tables below.
