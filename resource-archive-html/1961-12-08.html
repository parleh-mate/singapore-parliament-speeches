<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT'S POLICY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TOWARDS EXPATRIATES INTERVENING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN LOCAL POLITICAL AFFAIRS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I

apologise  to  the Member for Anson  for  having  been

absent from the Chamber yesterday at 2.30 p.m. but  I

have  explained to him that my Personal Assistant  was

ill. There was an oversight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's policy towards expatriates

intervening in local political affairs was  considered

and  stated  on the occasion when a Professor  of  the

University of Malaya inadvertently wandered  into  the

field of political controversy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case referred to by the Member for Anson, I

have  received a long letter from the lawyer concerned

and another from his client. The lawyer explained that

the offending statement attributed to him in the Press

was, in fact, a Press news item and not a statement by

him. The point that non-citizens should not enter  the

political    arena   which   includes   trade    union

disputes - particularly  where the  Communist-controlled

unions  are  involved  - has  already  been  made   and

understood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, we have stated that Government does not

approve   of   non-citizens  interfering  with   local

political affairs. The Government would strongly  urge

non-citizens  who are British European expatriates  to

stay out of the local political arena and let none of

their  acts,  either intentionally  or  otherwise,  be

construed  as intervening in local political  matters.

This  principle  applies to a  man  whether  he  is  a

Professor   at  the  University, a  lawyer   in   the

profession or  merchant in commerce.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Prime

Minister  whether he is conscious that a  man  in  the

exercise  of  his  professional duties  has  often  to

accept  instructions and to pursue a  line  of  action

which  may  be  deemed to have political implications.

Does  he then consider that because the person  is  an

expatriate he should be precluded from exercising  his

profession  in  any  fields  where  there   might   be

political implications?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the dividing line between

being  just  the  agent for an employer  and  being  a

participant is quite a clear one. A lawyer who  issues

a statement in the name of his client is only an agent

and  the  client takes the consequences. I  think  the

Member for Anson is aware - particularly in the case  of

Press  statements - that no advocate and  solicitor  can

issue  statements in his personal capacity or  in  his

firm's name, because that means, amongst other things,

breaching  the  rules  of  etiquette  with  regard  to

advertising. Had this statement been attributed not to

the  lawyer but to the client, a completely  different

position would have arisen. He would have been a  pure

agent.  But  where,  as in this particular  case,  the

Press report stated that he as the lawyer had said  so

after he left the Ministry of Labour, obviously he did

it in his capacity as the lawyer and not as the agent,

then  the Government drew certain inferences from  it.

As  I  have  explained, he has in a very  long  letter

elaborated  on the circumstances of how the  statement

came to be reported and I have no intention of opening

the matter unless he wishes to do so publicly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker. Sir,I

would  like it to be clearly understood that I am  not

here  at  his request nor have I had any communication

from him. But the statement made by the Prime Minister

does  raise anxiety from this point of view.  He  said

that  British expatriates should not intentionally  or

otherwise conduct themselves in a manner which may  be

deemed to interfere in our local politics. I would ask

whether, in fact, the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>



intends  that  to be a statement of Government  policy

and  that  if  these expatriates do  inadvertently  so

conduct  themselves that they are deemed to  interfere

in  our  local politics they are to believe  that  the

Sword of Damocles will then fall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I have stated in opening my

statement, the matter was carefully considered as  one

of  Government policy in the case of the Professor  of

the University of Malaya and the principle was clearly

enunicated - intended seriously and put across seriously

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and the line of demarcation between pursuing one's

profession   and   one's  academic  freedom   in   the

University and meddling in local affairs has been made

and  has been understood. From time to time, those who

transgress will have to be reminded of the  policy  of

the  Government.  If  it  is  a  pure  and  accidental

transgression,  surely  the  Government  will  not  be

unreasonable; but if it is persistently repeated, then

the Government must sit up and take note of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the   Prime   Minister  whether  he   would   consider

publishing the letters to which he referred.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the letters were sent to me

in  my  capacity as Prime Minister in the case of  the

employer. I am speaking now from recollection. I found

them in my tray, having been opened by my Secretary. I

think  they were marked 'confidential', but I have  no

objection  really  to asking the employer  to  publish

them. The one from the lawyer was marked 'personal and

confidential'. He is a man whom I have known for  some

time  at  the Bar. As I have said, I have no objection

to  his publishing that letter and my replying  to  it

publicly.  Sir, it is not for me to receive  a  letter

marked 'personal and confidential' and to publish  it.

But  if  either the employer or the lawyer  wishes  to

publish  it and open the subject for a public  debate,

then  I  must be prepared to allow them to do  so.  In

fact, I would not say I welcome it, nor would I say  I

do not welcome it. But if they take that step, then  I

enter  into the open controversy. But I cannot publish

a letter - particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



a long one - from a lawyer whom I  met,  in

fact,  quite accidentally at the Ipoh Airport. He  had

come  down from Cameron Highlands and in a few minutes

explained to me that it was all a misunderstanding and

then   set   out   in   a   long   letter   how    the

misunderstanding,  in his view, arose.  The  long  and

short  of it is that he said that it was a news report

and  not  a  statement by him. And  there  the  matter

rests.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I wonder whether

the  Prime  Minister means what he says. He says  that

non-citizens  should  not  interfere  in  trade  union

matters  of  Singapore and also in local politics.  He

knows that there are a number of non-citizens who  are

very  active in the trade union field. One non-citizen

particularly  named by him was alleged by  him  to  be

most   active  during  the  trouble  with  the  school

children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the most important principle

in  politics  is  basic realism. The person  that  the

Member for Cairnhill has referred to but not named,  I

think,  is  Mr Fong Swee Suan. We have  withheld  his

citizenship papers for reasons which I think are  well

known  to  Mr Fong Swee Suan, and I do not intend  to

publish them unless he insists on it. The case of  Mr

Fong Swee Suan and that of the lawyer concerned are  a

bit  different.  One is a British European  expatriate

who dropped into Singapore in the 1950's and wanted to

make  a  living.  He is staying here just  to  make  a

living.  The other one is a person who came here  from

the  Federation  of Malaya, went to the  Chinese  High

School   and  has  since  been  somewhat   active   in

Singapore. He has been involved in many of the  events

which  had  interested both the Member for  Cairnhill

when  he  was the Chief Minister and I since I  became

Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would say that, on principle, I fully agree

that  it  is  inadvisable for any  non-citizen  to  be

involved in political matters. It is not for me to say

how  circumstances may develop in which  it  would  be

very  unwise  for non-citizens to be so  involved,  be

they  expatriates  of  European, Indian  or  Ceylonese

origin, or even of other origin nearer home, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



perhaps obviously they feel that the time has not  yet

come  and  it is really left to future events  to  see

when the time will come.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have another question, Sir. Is the

Prime  Minister  not aware that the President  of  the

Chamber  of  Commerce, which arrogates to  itself  the

name "Singapore Chamber", has stated publicly that  he

supports  the Government on the merger issue?  Has  he

taken this matter up with the President?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I cannot tell the Member for

Anson  how  deeply the Government feels every  time  a

European opens his mouth in support of the Government.

On many occasions, I have not only told the Chamber of

Commerce but also even higher dignitaries - people  with

more  influence  in matters of commerce,  finance  and

other  things - to  stay out, whether they  are  for  or

against  the Government. If they come in and they  are

against  the Government, then we will deal with  them.

If  they come in and they are for the Government, then

they  are giving a stick to the Government's opponents

to deal harshly with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply indebted to the Member for Anson for

bringing  this  point  up publicly,  because  I  would

publicly like to disavow any support from any European

or  expatriate quarter for the Government. I say  this

unashamedly that those who wish us well and  are  non-citizens do best by keeping quiet and praying silently

that the country will go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



on  peacefully and prosperously. Those who are against

the  Government and open their big mouths may  find  a

lot of unpleasant consequences.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT ON WATER SITUATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I had promised earlier that

I would try to review the water position as soon as it

could be reconsidered and the question of rationing. I

would like to give the House an interim report on  the

present water situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainfall this year up to the end of November was

only 60.09 inches as against the average over the last

86 years for the same months of January to November of

85.24 inches. In other words, we are already short  by

25  inches this year. Even if we get average  rainfall

in  December,  we shall be far short  of  the  average

rainfall  which, over 86 years, has been  95.7  inches

per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, the table of comparative monthly

rainfall* in inches - the average as against the  months

January  to November 1961 - and I will table this  for

the information of Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levels and capacity of all reservoirs at present

are  58  per cent below normal. The total capacity  of

all  our  reservoirs both in Singapore and  Johore  is

5,900,400,000 gallons as against the present  quantity

of  only  2,498,600,000 gallons, giving a shortage  of

3,401,800,000 gallons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the levels and capacities of our

reservoirs as on 3rd December, 1961, are as follows - I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the present stocks are only 42 per

cent of the full capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal consumption of water in Singapore, which

includes  Johore  Bahru,  Sir,  which  we  supply,  is

approximately  70 million gallons per  day,  of  which

about  40 million gallons come from the Tebrau  River,

and  does  not directly affect our stocks,  whilst  30

million  gallons  is  drawn directly  from  reservoirs

either in Singapore or Johore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With inadequate rainfall this year, the rate of

withdrawal from our stocks has created a deteriorating

situation  in  which it has been necessary  to  impose

rationing  in order to conserve the balance  of  water

stocks as best we can. By the rationing, we have  been

able  to reduce from 30 million gallons per day to  20

million  gallons per day, the amount we draw from  the

reservoirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year over the rainy months of November,

December,  and  January, the reservoirs  are  normally

filled  up  to total capacity. Well, November  is  now

past,  Sir,  and I may just read the November  figures - November, normally 9.89 inches, but this year  it  was

only   8.65;  1.24  inches  short.  But  it   is   our

expectation  that  over  the months  of  December  and

January, the shortage of 3,400 million gallons will be

made up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that it would be imprudent to

lift rationing altogether until we are quite sure that

the Northeast monsoon for December and January will be

wet,  not  only  in North Malaya but also  over  South

Johore and Singapore. As soon as indications are that

the  monsoon  is  wet and there is a fair  expectation

that  the reservoirs will be filled up by the  end  of

the monsoon period of January, water rationing will be

lifted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, in view of the public concern and talk

about this matter, which I am sure is quite unpleasant

to  the  Government, would the Prime Minister  clarify

whether  the  political  pressure  in  Singapore   has

anything to do with the variation in water pressure?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is completely out of order. Let us

not have frivolities but serious statements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have ruled that question out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have ruled it out of order,

but  if  I may, Mr Speaker, Sir, you are fully  aware

that  the  question having been asked, I  cannot  hide

behind the Speaker's ruling publicly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Very briefly then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Very briefly, Sir. The fact that

the   Communists  should  find  that  not   only   the

nationalists but also the gods are against them is not

something for which they can blame the

P.A.P.  But  I can assure the Member for Thomson - whose

friend,  Dominic Puthucheary, tells me that  he  often

misses   his   bath   as  a  result   of   the   water

rationing - that  it  is not because  of  the  Tunku  or

because  of the P.A.P. that he had been somewhat  more

stuffy than usual when I saw him in the C.P.A. Room.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, am I right in

assuming from the Prime Minister's statement that  the

earliest day on which we can expect water rationing to

be lifted is sometime in February 1962?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not think that is the

impression I want to create. I would have liked, as  I

have  indicated earlier, to be able in the  course  of

the  debate to say that stocks are so improving  that,

we   could  lift  water  rationing  immediately.   But

unfortunately November, which is normally a wet  month

giving 9.89 inches, has again this year been short  by

1.24  inches.  And if December and January  again  are

short of the normal in this same way, I have been told

that  it  would  be  most  inadvisable  to  lift   the

rationing.  But  if in the course of  December  it  is

quite  clear that we are going to have a wet  December

and  a  wet  January, we might lift it by the  end  of

December.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now we

had an explanation by the Prime Minister of the water

position. If there is plenty of rainfall and if there

would not be any water next year -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did not quite get that. I have

not  heard  that  at all. Perhaps the  Prime  Minister

would assist by saying what the question was.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not mean anything offensive

if I say that it is just the Member's Hainanese accent

which I find difficult to follow and which some of the

Barisan Members also find difficult. Perhaps he  could

ask  the  question  again slowly and  I  will  try  to

follow, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member please remember that

this   is  a  supplementary  question - it  must  be   a

supplementary question - and no comments should be  made

which  will  raise a debate. It should  be  a  serious

question. Otherwise he will be ruled out of order. Mr

Lin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have one doubt here.

If  there  is plenty of water at present but  if  next

year there should not be any water, then we would have

water rationing throughout the year then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg to reply in Mandarin to the

Member for Moulmein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): The question was not if there was no

water next year. The question was that at present  the

reservoirs  are short of water by some  58  per  cent.

With  this  shortage of 58 per cent, we  must  try  to

cover  not by way of buying water but by the  weather.

If  unfortunately  the Russians  should  explode  more

nuclear  bombs, then under such abnormal circumstances

we  would  not  have sufficient rain for December  and

January next year. We just could not help it.  But  if

the Member for Moulmein has any suggestion to make  at

that time as to how we could get sufficient water  for

the people or to make water for the people, such as to

make use of dry ice or to have artificial rain, then I

shall be very grateful for his assistance.

[1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the

recommendation  of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  before

the  Committee proceeds with the consideration of  the

Main Estimates and the Development Estimates?

signify.



<div align="center"><h4>MAIN ESTIMATES, 1962</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the Main Estimates. For the

convenience of hon. Members, I intend taking the total

for  each head as it appears in the last column of the

abstract of estimated expenditure for the year 1962 on

pages 41 and 42 of Paper Cmd. 35 of 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing now with the Heads of Expenditure in

respect of which amendments stand on the Order Paper.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 4.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment stood in the name of Inche Mohamed Ali bin Alwi.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 4, Mr Speaker, as it appears on page 50 of

the Estimates, reads "Purchase of Official Presents  .

.  .  $500." This apparently is an entirely new  item

which  has  been  introduced  this  year.  I  am   not

complaining  about the amount, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  But

what  I  wish to inquire of the Minister is,  what  is

expected to be purchased out of the $500



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>



for  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara or on his behalf?  In

this connection, perhaps I might throw this into focus

better if, while discussing this item, I touch on  the

Prime Minister's vote. On page 6 of the Order Paper, I

have  an amendment standing in my name, "That the  sum

to  be  allocated  for Head 7 be  reduced  by  $10  in

respect  of subhead 7." I have personally no objection

to these two heads as such. But what I wish to know is

something about the comparative figures, and why it is

more  in  the case of the Prime Minister than  in  the

case  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Mr Speaker, Sir,

if you will permit me to deal with both those items at

the same time, perhaps it would be more convenient.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It would be convenient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On page 74, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an

item  under the title "Official Presentations  .  .  .

$1,500." Here again this is an entirely new item which

appears  in  the  next  year's  Estimates.  Could   I,

therefore,  ask  the  Minister why  it  is  that  $500

appears  under the Yang di-Pertuan Nagara's  vote  and

$1,500 under the Prime Minister's vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I must first explain the

normal  procedure with regard to gifts. From  time  to

time,  the  Head  of  State and the Ministers  receive

gifts  from  visiting dignitaries and other  Ministers

from  foreign  countries who pass  through  Singapore.

Normal courtesy requires that there is reciprocity  of

these  gifts. In the old days, Sir, what happened  was

that  where  they were personal gifts, that  is,  the

gifts were to the person con, cerned, he kept it. When

he  reciprocated,  he  paid for  it  out  of  his  own

expenses. He kept the gift that was given to him,  and

he  paid  for the gift that was given to the  visiting

dignitary.  In  fact, the ruling since the  Government

took  office  is  that  all  gifts  presented  to  the

Ministers  or to the Head of State are surrendered  to

the  Treasury. If they cannot be used, they are either

disposed  of by the Treasury or they are left  in  the

Istana



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



Negara, the State Guest House, or the reception  rooms

of the various Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of

clarification, Mr Speaker. I am not participating  in

the debate. But I would like to correct the suggestion

that previously the ruling was that we could keep  the

gift.  In so far as I am aware, at no time did any  of

the  Ministers  retain any gifts  received  officially

from  other  Ministers or Government.  They  were  all

handed in to the Treasury.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think there was a distinction

between  the official and the non-official  Ministers.

The  elected Ministers, as in the case of  the  former

Chief  Minister,  the Member for  Cairnhill,  and  his

colleagues, paid out of their entertainment vote  when

they  bought  gifts in return. They surrendered  their

gifts  to  the  Treasury. In the  case  of  the  other

officials,  I think the practice was that either  they

bought gifts in return out of their own emoluments and

then  kept  the gifts, or they left the gifts  in  the

Istana.  As far as I know, either the gifts were  kept

in  the Istana or left in the Treasury. Anyway,  these

are  not  very important things. What has happened  is

that for the last two years, when we reciprocated,  we

paid   for  it  front  the  entertainment  vote.   The

Accountant-General queried this and said that this was

not  a  proper  vote  for  the reciprocity  of  gifts.

Therefore, a modest sum has been entered for the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara and for myself.  It  is  more  for

myself because out of this vote come the gifts for all

Ministers. That is the reason for the $1,500 for me as

against the $500 for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment is also in the name of Inche Mohd. Ali.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, can the Prime Minister please

clarify how many gifts have been received that need to

be   reciprocated  officially?  Could   the   Minister

indicate what emblems were used on the gifts that were

reciprocated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In Malay, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this

matter is not an easy one for me to explain, because

the gifts received from Ministers from other States

are those that we cannot really evaluate because some

of them are antiques and are very costly. Indeed, like

the gift from the Prime Minister of the Provisional

Government of Algeria, it was a scimitar. We left that

at Sri Temasek because many people go there and they

would like to know whose gift it was. So it is

difficult for us to evaluate the gifts. But because

ours is a small State, when we reciprocate, the gifts

are, if possible, those made in Malaya. They are

produced by the Malay Arts and Crafts of Kuala Lumpur.

I feel proud that we share the pride of Malaya in the

achievements of their arts and crafts, especially

those produced by the craftsmen in Trengganu and

Kelantan. We hope that in future or in ten years'

time, we wilt be able to give our own gifts in return

is the form of art mementoes from the State of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment to subhead 4 of Head 1

can be taken together with that to subhead 7 of Head 7

at  page  74. Tun Lim and Inche Ahmad Jabri have  also

given  notice  of  amendments to the Prime  Minister's

vote.  Do  they wish to speak? When we  come  to  that

item,  there  will be no motion moved.  I  am  talking

about  the  question of gifts. No further  comment  on

that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Just one comment. The Prime Minister has

indicated  that some of these objects are  objects  of

art,  and  perhaps they are not able to be valued.  In

those  circumstances,  would the  Government  consider

donating  them  to the National Museum?  Where  it  is

possible to evaluate them in terms of money, I take it

there  will  be some Treasury control over  the  sale.

Will  the  Minister for Finance assure the House  that

there  is  a corresponding entry in the income  column

for these sales?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Usually these gifts are collected

and  auctioned  in  public once a year.  The  proceeds

appear somewhere in an item of revenue. I am not quite

sure where.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I say this? From time to time

we  do receive gifts. I do not want it to be indicated

that it is not appreciated. I hope the debate will not

take  that  line. But there are times when  the  gifts

cannot  be suitably displayed either in the Istana  or

the  reception rooms of Ministers and Sri Temasek  and

so  on. Then there is a surplus. But we do not want to

give  people the impression that we do not  appreciate

the thought behind the gifts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the explanation, Mr Speaker, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item is in respect of a vote for a motor car for

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I would like to know what

kind of motor car it is intended to purchase with this

vote  of $12,350 and for what use. Also, how many cars

are there at present in the Istana Negara.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The sum of $12,350 is for the

purchase  of a Rover car to replace the Rover  car  at

present in use, which is approximately nine years old.

As  I  understand it, the cars at the disposal of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for his guests consist of  one

Rover car and one Number Pullman. There is no suitable

alternative  to the Humber Pullman, and  the  cast  of

maintenance is mounting year by year. I hope  by  next

year  we  might be able to find a suitable alternative

to replace the Humber Pullman.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Speaker's car is a Humber Pullman!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am told, that

the  garage  has been complaining about  the  cost  of

maintenance. So it is in the case of Ministers and  so

on.  There are two kinds of cars, as I understand  it.

One is for utility purposes and the other is where one

has  to  go  and present oneself for the  occasion.  I

hope,  Sir,  when there is a suitable replacement  for

the   Humber  Pullman  and  the  House  feels   in   a

sufficiently  generous mood, we shall look  after  the

Speaker also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $224,670 for Head 1 ordered to stand part of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 2 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, with your permission, I move  that  all  the

three amendments* in respect of Head 2 be taken together.



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The amendments reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (12) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (59) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (60) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we study the Estimates, we find that under item (12) of subhead 1, there are two Interpreters (Malay). There are Chinese and Indian Senior Interpreters,

but no Malay Senior Interpreter. I hope the Government will

clarify why there are no Malay Senior Interpreters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In items (59) and (60) there are only Chinese and Indian

Interpreters  in the Civil District Courts,  but  no  Malay

Interpreter.  I  ask this question because  I  feel  it  is

important  as it concerns justice or fair play. A defendant

in  court must be given a proper hearing. I think it is not

fair, Mr Speaker, if the defendant in court happens to  be

a  Malay.  It  may  be  that his views  are  not  correctly

represented and this will be very bad for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see that the defendants in court will not

be unjustly fined.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 2 be reduced by $10

in respect of item (12) of subhead 1."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate may range over items (59) and (60) of the same

subhead, which appear in page 54.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I answer it in Malay? (In

Malay):  As  to this matter, the position, to my  mind,  is

this.  As  regards the Supreme Court interpreters  and  the

District  Court  interpreters, the reason for  there  being

more  Indian or Chinese interpreters is not for the purpose

of increasing their number. This matter concerns people who

are  witnesses  and whose evidence requires interpretation.

There  are  not many Malay witnesses and, therefore,  there

are not as many Malay interpreters as there are Chinese  or

Indian interpreters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Singapore comprises 70 per cent

Chinese;  therefore more Chinese interpreters are required.

For  that  reason, the Indian interpreters are in a  better

position.  Since  the  Malays are a  peace  loving  people,

therefore  the  position  of the Malay  interpreters  is  a

little  unsatisfactory from the point of view. I  think  in

the other courts there are not many cases involving Malays.

I  am  not  quite clear as to why there is no Senior  Malay

Interpreter.  I  hope the Member for the  Southern  Islands

will  be satisfied and allow me to investigate further into

the matter.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I do not wish to debate the

explanation given by the Prime Minister. This is  a  matter

of  fair  play  or justice. Although there are  few  Malays

involved  in  quarrels  or  fights,  and  taken  to  court,

however,  in  the name of justice, it is only  proper  that

this matter should be given consideration. An assurance has

been  given  by the Prime Minister that he will investigate

the  matter  further. I have not yet received a reply  from

the  Prime Minister with regard to the lower courts, is the

position there the same? In view of the explanation, I  beg

leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendments (2)* and (3)* are not being moved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, That the sum to

be  allocated for Head 2 be reduced by $10 in  respect

of subhead 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 57 of the Estimates - Legal Assistance in

Assize  Court  and  in the Court of Criminal  Appeal - I

understand that the vote has been reduced from $14,500

(1961)  to  $12,000 (1962) mainly because the  amounts

that  have been voted in 1961 have not been  used  up.

Sir, I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he would

reconsider the question of the quantum. You  know  the

position,  Mr Speaker, Sir. There is a panel  and  on

this  panel  go  the  names of  lawyers  who  wish  to

participate  in this. Normally, those  who  put  their

names on the panel are junior members of the Bar, more

often  then  not  members of  the  Bar  who  are  just

beginning their practice. All this arises out of cases

assigned to' those on the roster in respect of capital

charges. Cases are assigned to these young lawyers  as

their  names appear on this roster, and the fees  paid

to  them, to my mind anyway, are not commensurate with

the work which they have to undertake. They have to do

a  fair  amount of "getting-up" in these things.  They

work  very hard and the getting-up fee allowed by  the

Registrar (it is not his fault, Mr Speaker,  Sir;  it

has been a time-honoured custom and I think these fees

have remained for some time without change) is, in  my

opinion  anyway, not commensurate with the work  which

the  young  lawyer has to undertake. I  ask  the  hon.

Prime  Minister whether he would, in the light of  the

present  day cost of living, give consideration  to  a

review  of the fees payable to young lawyers  who  put

their  names  on this roster. After all, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, they are doing a public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to address the House on, and I

ask the Prime Minister to consider it, is this. At the

moment,  Sir,  this  legal aid is  only  available  to

persons  who  are  charged with  capital  offences.  I

wonder whether the State would consider extending this

assistance  to  persons who are charged with  offences

which involve imprisonment for life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am quite prepared to

consider any representation from the Bar. This is  the

first  time  I  have  heard  that  young  lawyers  are

dissatisfied. As a matter of fact, I was thinking that

with   the  exodus  of  20,  30,  40 - in  progressive

numbers - of  lawyers from the University of Malaya,  it

may  well  be that the roster may swell to beyond  all

manageable  proportions. But if a case could  be  made

out  for  an  increase  - and the  increase  is  to  be

correlated  with  the seniority  of  the  lawyer,  not

necessarily commensurate with the market value of  the

lawyer, but as a token of recognition that the  lawyer

is, after all, more than 7 years' standing and has had

considerable practice at the Bar - I am quite prepared

to  put  the  matter up for the consideration  of  the

State  Advocate-General who will no doubt  advise  the

Minister for Law and myself as to the propriety of it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish for a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I did ask the Prime Minister whether

he  would  consider  extending  this  aid  to  persons

involved  in  cases  where  the  punishment  is   life

imprisonment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think this is a matter on which

we  would  consider any representation  from  the  Bar

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to he allocated for Head 2 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a curious procedure, Sir, that I have to seek

to  reduce  it  in  order  to  say  that  I  want  it

increased.  We  have  had  the  Minister  for  Finance

informing  us  that  changes in  the  remuneration  of

Judges  are being considered. But in so far as  I  can

ascertain, Sir, there is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



completely inadequate comprehension of the status of a

Judge in this territory. Unfortunately, they have been

drawn  from the civil service and there is an attitude

that they are civil servants and that their pay should

be  in some fashion - how shall I say it? - in conformity

with   civil   service  scales.  It  is   inadequately

appreciated,  Sir, that they are the very  cornerstone

of  democracy.  Without the Judges in this  territory,

there  could be no democracy. I say we ought  to  give

them a status compatible with the work that we seek of

them  with  the position that they, in fact,  hold  in

this territory. We also expect a great deal from them,

Sir,It is not that we can buy integrity with money. I

am not saying that we could get better integrity - it is

not  possible.  I am not asking for more  remuneration

from the point of view of integrity. But I do say that

we  should  be fair to them. We ask a great deal  from

them,   not   only   from  the  point   of   view   of

responsibility,  but we also ask them  to  maintain  a

very  high  social standard which entails considerable

expense.  In  my  view,  Sir, we  must  cast  off  our

previous prejudices about the salary scales of  Judges

and  we  must  recognise that the Chief Justice  of  a

territory has an equal status with the Prime Minister,

and  that  the  Judges have an equal status  with  the

Ministers,  and we should go from there. I know,  Sir,

that we are very much tied up at present with thoughts

of a merger with the Federation and the possibility of

the amalgamation of the two services, and consequently

the  need to keep the two concepts of remuneration  in

both  territories equal. I say, Sir, we should give  a

lead  now  and I do plead with the Prime  Minister  to

give an assurance not only in respect of the Judges of

the  High Court, but do you know, Sir, that a District

Judge  earns less than two clerks in my office and  he

can sentence a person to 7 years' imprisonment? It  is

completely farcical that a clerk should get more  than

a District Judge. The entire remuneration of the legal

service   and   the   judicial   service   should   be

reconsidered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am in full sympathy with

the remarks made by the Member for Anson. On more than

one  occasion  I have expressed my own  views  to  the

Chief  Justice and his brother Judges. But the problem

I  am faced with is not only how to bring them out  of

the salary scales which are tied up with so many other

salary scales in the past. Even if we succeed in doing

that without upsetting the Speaker, the Ministers, the

Parliamentary Secretaries, the Permanent  Secretaries,

and so on, there is a very serious problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that if you want to maintain a strong

judiciary, the time has come when you have to  recruit

not  only from within the service but from without the

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To do that - as the Member for

Anson  well knows - one can only hope that there  are  a

sufficient number of able and senior counsel who  feel

that  they  have  done their sweat  at  the  Bar,  put

something  by, and are prepared to spend the  rest  of

their active years on the Bench. I have discussed this

matter   incidentally  also  with   passing   judicial

dignitaries from the United Kingdom. The explanation I

have been given of how the practice works in London is

that  the Judges there do not have to retired  at  62.

They  sometimes go on the Bench at well near  60,  and

they  do  another  eight  or nine  years.  It  is  the

expectation  of a fairly handsome pension which  makes

them do it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The time has expired. Does the

part of the Estimates.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 4 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (6) of subhead 1.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this concerns our Simultaneous

Interpreters.  I believe there are three  of  them - one

Chinese, one Malay and one Tamil. What will happen  if

one  of  them were to fall sick? I think we must  have

two  interpreters for each language so that there will

be six interpreters in all.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a matter for the House Committee,

unless the Prime Minister wishes to say anything.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you have pointed out that this

is  a  matter for the House Committee, I can only add,

for  the  benefit  of  the  Member  for  the  Southern

Islands,  that  there are part, time interpreters.  If

anybody   should   fall  ill,   then   the   part-time

interpreter is called upon. So far, there has been  no

occasion when interpretation was not possible  because

there   was   either  no  permanent  or  no  part-time

interpreter present. But if the House Committee  wants

to  make  its  representation, then  it  is  a  matter

entirely out of my hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 4 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (8) of subhead 1.



<br><br>This  concerns the Reporters. I think there  are  many

Malays  who  wish  to  read  the  proceedings  of  the

Assembly but they lack a knowledge of English. I think

the proceedings should also be taken down in Malay, as

is  done  in the Federation, to enable the  Malays  to

read  them.  Malay reporting should be encouraged.  We

know  there  is  Malay shorthand. This opportunity  is

just good for those qualified in Malay shorthand.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Official Report, of course, under

the  Constitution is in the English language. I  think

it  is  a  question of expense as to  whether  we  can

produce  a  Malay  Report as well. Perhaps  the  House

Committee can look into that as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 4 he reduced by

$10 in respect of item (20) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I would like to raise is about the

Assembly servants who are now serving the Assembly and

Members of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Assembly servants and the caretaker were

appointed,  I think, way back in 1955 when there  were

only  32 Assemblymen. Today, the number of Assemblymen

has  increased  to 51 and yet we still have  the  same

number  of  servants  to look  after  the  comfort  of

Assemblymen.  I  was  wondering  whether   the   Prime

Minister   would  increase  the  number  of   Assembly

servants  to four so that there will be a rotation  in

their  hours  of duty, as I think they are  not  being

given  fair  treatment. For instance. I do  know  that

they check in at about 7.30 in the morning and on  any

normal sitting day they do not leave the Assembly till

after 9.30 in the evening, which means 14 hours'  work

a  day  invariably. We do have night sitting up to  12

o'clock midnight or 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, and

that  would  mean up to about 17 or 18 hours'  work  a

day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would suggest to the Prime Minister that it is

about  time  that we increased the number of  Assembly

servants, if not on a permanent basis then at least on

a temporary basis.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Here again, it is a matter which the

House    Committee   could   deal   with   and    make

recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Abdul Hamid: Mr Speaker, Sir, may I point out

that  there were a number of recommendations  made  by

the House Committee last year but they were thrown out

by  the  Minister for Finance? Every time we  went  to

him, he said there was no money.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The answer to that is that if a

recommendation is thrown out, a substantive motion can

be moved in the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I agree with the Member for

Geylang Serai that there is a case for an increase  in

the  number  of  servants, not  only  because  of  the

increase in the number of Members but also because  of

the  increase in the number of guests that Members now

bring to the C.P.A. Room during sitting hours. By  the

very  nature of things, we have a hectic  one  or  two

weeks  and  then a lapse for two or three  weeks,  and

again another hectic one or two weeks. Because of  the

fluctuation in their duties, I would suggest that  the

answer is for the House Committee to consider ways and

means whereby temporary staff are engaged as and  when

the  House is in session; as otherwise when the  House

is  not in session, you will just have an overflow  of

people doing nothing in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think this is not true of the Assembly servants. I  am

told  that  even if the House is not in session,  they

have to work almost every day to about 6 p.m. cleaning

the  windows,  the lavatories, etc, of  the  Assembly

House - and sometimes during Committee meetings. On  the

last  occasion when we had a sitting till 12 midnight,

although   I  was  not  approached  by  the   servants

themselves, I understand they did not have time to  go

home.  We  left  the  House at 12  midnight  and  they

finished  their work at about 3 a.m. So what they  did

was  to  sleep  in the Assembly House  itself  without

having a bath or a wash and a change of clothes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this has been going on for a number

of  years  and I think the only solution  is  to  have

temporary staff - one servant perhaps when the  Assembly

is  not in session; three or four when the Assembly is

in  session, when Members want them to buy food, serve

beer  and run a lot of errands. For all the work  that

they have to do, ranging from 10 to 20 hours a day,  I

understand  they are only paid $142 a month  inclusive

of allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe it is time for the Government to take some action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps it is time the House Committee

should look very, very deeply into this matter in  the

first  instance,  and  if the recommendations  of  the

House  Committee  are not accepted by the  Government,

then  that is the time Members could move a motion.  I

do  not think it is proper now to blame the Government

because  we  have  a House Committee that  looks  into

these matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What I am trying to point out is

simply this. If we start talking about the hardship of

Assembly  servants  and of Assemblymen  and  of  those

without motor cars having to go home by taxi and being

waylaid  and  so  on, there will  be  no  end  to  it.

Everybody has a hard life. This is not the place where

we  start  spinning hardship yarns. This is the  place

where  we  debate  very  important  matters - not  these

servants of the Assembly. It is not because we do  not

care  for them. There is a House Committee to consider

their  case.  But  if  we  start  spinning  yarns  and

striking a pose, Sir, everybody can do likewise and we

will  soon  reduce the proceedings of this Chamber  to

quite a comic operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With great respect to the Member for Hong Lim - he is

an   experienced  man  in  politics  and  we  are  not

altogether new in these matters - we do not want to  get

involved  in  these hardship stories - the sob  line.  I

suggest  that in future all such matters, before  they

come  here, go to the House Committee, get the  proper

ventilation  and  be  brought up  through  the  proper

channels;  otherwise  we  might  have  difficulty   in

getting  the  attention of the Assembly  servants.  It

depends  on  who gives them more voice in this  debate - he   can  then  catch  their  eye.  Things  get  very

complicated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we are getting away from

the  point. I have already indicated the procedure  to

be  followed.  If, as I say, a recommendation  by  the

House  Committee is not accepted, or even if the House

Committee by a slim majority does not agree  with  the

minority,  the  minority will be at  liberty  to  file

notice of a motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I

must  make  this  clear.  Members  of  the  United

People's  Party have never been given preferential

treatment  by these two Assembly servants.  On  no

occasion have I been approached by them -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, I never suggested that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - nor have I been lobbied to

speak   on   their  behalf.  Neither   have   they

complained to me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think everybody

understands that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Abdul Hamid: Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

your  assurance and the assurance of the  Minister

for  Finance-  he has just winked at  me - I  beg  to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 4 be

<hr size="2" noshade>

++The same amendment stood in the names of Tun Lim Yew Hock and Mr Ong Eng Guan.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have on a previous occasion, that is last

year,  touched  upon the same subject.  The  Prime

Minister  knows the arguments which I advanced  to

the House in his presence on that occasion, and  I

do  not  wish to take up time as time is  pressing

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason why I wanted this ventilated

again,  Sir, is this, it is not very of  ten  that

any  Parliament  is blessed with  having  all  the

Chief Ministers and the present Prime Minister  in

the  same House on one given occasion. The  Member

for  Anson was the first Chief Minister, succeeded

by the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



Cairnhill, and now the Prime Minister. Perhaps the

three of them could tell us why, although it is  a

desirable objective, it is not yet achieved.  This

matter  has  been discussed for  a  long  time;  I

understand,  during the time  of  the  Member  for

Anson when he was Chief Minister, and later when -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has not mentioned what

he  is  talking  about - the independence  of  the

Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am sorry. I beg your pardon. I

thought I had made that clear. It is a question of

the  independence of the staff of the Assembly,  a

matter  which I have ventilated in previous years.

As the Member for Anson has indicated, just as the

judiciary  are the pillars of democracy,  I  think

the  Assembly  staff also in  their  own  way  are

pillars  of  democracy, in the  sense  that  where

conflicting  interest between the  Government  and

the  Opposition  are  concerned,  members  of  the

Assembly  staff  have to keep a  strictly  neutral

attitude; and not only a neutral attitude but also

a   stiff  upper  lip,  which  is  sometimes  very

difficult to do. And I think any sort of system or

procedure  that  will ensure  a  respectful  stiff

upper lip should be encouraged.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the

Member for Farrer Park has said was actually  what

I  wanted  to  say  when I  gave  notice  of  this

amendment.  The  independence of  the  Legislative

Assembly staff is very, very desirable if  we  all

really believe in parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has asked the

question - why was this not done at the time when  I

was   Chief   Minister?  I  have  a  very   simple

explanation.  I  was  working  under  the   Rendel

Constitution, and the civil services  was  in  the

hands of a colonial official, the Chief Secretary.

Much as I wanted to do it, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



could make no headway because the Chief Secretary  was

in full control of the civil service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just Wish to

bring up two points under this head.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on the question of independence

of the Assembly staff?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can we deal with that first?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether the

Member  for Hong Lim was dealing with the question  of

independence  of the Assembly staff.  If  he  is  not,

perhaps we can deal with that topic first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, my recollection of the

reasons  for the arrangements made in the Constitution

is  not  that of the Member for Cairnhill. The  Member

for  Cairnhill now finds a convenient answer  for  all

the  ills  of  the past. Every time it is  the  absent

colonial  official  who  is now  responsible  for  his

unhappiness  in  the  past.  I  think  the  world  was

responsible  for some of his grievous  problems  then.

But  certainly not this one because he was  the  Chief

Minister  when  he  led  the All-Party  Delegation  to

London.  You  were  then making representations  about

setting up a certain independent post, and he  was  in

complete agreement with the colonial officials. And he

got  the  rest of the All-Party Delegation in complete

agreement   with   him - that  the   opportunities   for

advancement in the Legislative Assembly are  so  small

that  it  is  very  unlikely that we will  get  people

coming  into the service as such. As I have  said  the

last time - and I repeat the argument this year as I did

last  year  and the year before - if the Assembly  staff

say, "All right. I want to stay in the Assembly and  I

don't  want ever to be posted out. I want to be  in  a

separate  service,  and I lose  my  opportunities  for

promotion in the Government." - well, let them make  the

representation.    We   have    not    received    the

representation yet. For the very simple reason that if

they  make  that  representation,  then  avenues   for

promotion in the Assembly stop and there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



no  other  avenues for promotion. If you  have  young,

reasonably  healthy First Clerk, Second  Clerk,  Third

Clerk, Chief Reporter, Deputy Chief Reporter, and  you

join  the Assembly staff as a separate and independent

service and you grow old together with the Chief  and,

worse  still, you pre-decease him, then you might  end

up  your  careers  as, say, the unknown  Fifth  Clerk;

never heard of ever since. Whereas if you are part  of

the  Government service, you might be more  fortunate.

If  avenues are not readily open in the Assembly, then

you  transfer out to the medical services or the Legal

Department  or some other Ministry of the  Government.

The  problem  is as simple as that. As you  know,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, there are certain specialist  jobs.  In

the  case of those officials, they are not posted  out

unless they give their consent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is to be a radical alteration in the terms

and  conditions of service, I say it comes from  them.

If they want their avenues of promotion blocked, well,

so  be it. But they cannot have it, as the Speaker has

suggested   once,  both  ways - that   they   can   post

themselves  out  but whilst they  are  here  they  are

independent.  That is not possible.  They  are  either

part  of the service and they take their chances  like

everybody  else  in the service to go up  the  ladder,

which  includes  the Assembly, or  they  stay  in  the

Assembly. And if they stay in the Assembly, then  they

forgo  the  opportunities for  advancement  elsewhere.

They  cannot have it both ways. We have argued it  out

with  logic  and reason in Establishment practice.  If

they  are  an  independent  service,  then  they  have

nothing to do with the Government. And if there is  an

opening for promotion in the Government, well,  it  is

not  open to them any more. It has been suggested that

whilst  they are in the Assembly, they are out of  the

Government.  But  the moment they  hear  there  is  an

opening,  they say, "I come back," and  then  "I  move

off."  That  is not possible. The Establishment  would

not have it. And I think the Finance Minister is quite

right in backing up his Establishment on that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The problem is a sufficiently important

one,  Mr Speaker, Sir. The difficulty arises  because

the  Assembly  here is such a small Assembly  and  the

staff  are  so  small.  But in most  other  countries,

perhaps  it  could  be an independent  service  having

prospects of advancement within itself. But because we

cannot  here  conform  to Establishment  practice  and

rules  outside  Singapore, we must not therefore  deny

that there is not a problem here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to take up much time because I hear the

Member  for Hong Lirn wants to speak also.  But  could

the  Hon, the Prime Minister agree to a Committee  of

this   House  going  into  this  problem  and   making

recommendations?  And  Government,  as  well  as   the

Opposition,  making an inquiry into the whole  problem

and  reporting  to the whole House? If  he  agrees  to

that, I am quite happy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if it is just an assurance

that a Committee making recommendations will make  the

Member  for Farrer Park happy, I am completely all  in

favour   of   making  him  happy.  But   provided   he

understands  that  the position of the  Establishment,

which  we  support,  is that a man  is  either  in  or

outside  the  Government service. That  is  the  basic

principle  from which we analyse or view any proposal.

If  the Member for Farrer Park understands that and at

the  same time he wants a Committee to try and find  a

way to fit in that principle, I say, by all means. The

problem  has been viewed from almost every conceivable

angle,  not  least  of all by you, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

because you are the person most closely connected with

it  and  the  person upon whom the problem  is  always

pressing.  But  unless there is  a  novel  proposition

which  is  like  the Gordian knot  and  a  knife  cuts

through it all, I do not see how we can get out  of  a

very  simple  proposition. If  you  want  an  Assembly

service,  then you are out of the Government  service.

You cannot be in the Government service and out of the

Government service at the same time. That, I think, is

a simple proposition which nobody can get out of. What

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



are  saying is this, by all means leave the Government

service  if  you  want  and  be  a  separate  Assembly

service, but you cannot have it both ways.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think there could be a solution, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if only the Prime Minister would  agree

to  it. I think the Minister for Finance should sit on

that Committee, representing the Government. It is not

only the Government, Sir, but the Establishment Branch

of the Administrative side. I can understand the Prime

Minister's concern - that Government servants  do  not

like this sort of thing. I appreciate that. But on the

other  hand,  I think, Govermnent servants  themselves

should  appreciate the difficulties of  the  Assembly.

Perhaps,  Sir,  if  we could get across  each  other's

points of view, some solution could be found. I  would

be  quite  content, Sir, if the Prime  Minister  would

agree  to  such  a  Committee with  the  Minister  for

Finance sitting on it as a member.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just draw attention to section 46

subsection  (6) - the Minister for  Finance  has  just

motion. But whichever way we go, we come back  to  the

original  starting point, and there must be a solution

to  that.  You are either in or out of the  Government

service. You cannot be in the service and out of it at

the same time. That is the simple proposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am quite content to held the Minister

for Finance. He is an eminently reasonable person.  He

likes logic. He says so. He is always telling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>



the  members  of  Barisan, "You do not  know  anything

about  logic," and that is why he disagrees with them,

and  quite rightly. But illogical arguments  could  be

advanced,  I think he will be convinced. If  only  the

Prime Minister would agree to that, I am quite sure we

can  advance  sufficiently logical  arguments  to  the

Minister  for  Finance  to get  him  off  the  present

difficult position he is in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not been

talking  about  the  issue raised just  now  by  other

Members.  It is because to talk about independence  at

this juncture to the Government Benchers would be just

like playing a violin to a cow.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Playing what?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> That is why, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

come  to  more  immediate problem to  he  solved.  For

instance,   the   two  Assembly  servants,   who   are

overworked.  And there are others who are  overworked.

Mr  Speaker,  I  wish to mention  in  particular  the

Reporters of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We have already dealt with those

two  items,  the Assembly servants and the  Reporters.

This is a motion which reduces the whole Head by $100,

and  therefore there should be a debate on the general

policy  of the Government in the Legislature, and  not

on the items, in detail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I am just frying to

acquaint  you  with what will happen  in  the  future.

There  will  be a lot of these long sessions  and,  as

such  I  think  we  must bring the  attention  of  the

Government to the fact that we must create a  pool  of

more  part-time Simultaneous interpreters, a  pool  of

part-time  Reporters, and perhaps a pool of  part-time

servants   and   watchmen   to   meet   the   changing

circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I only want to comment on

what  was said by the Member for Farrer Park. He  said

that  I  am  in  some  difficulty  over  this  matter.

Actually I am in no difficulty at all. I am not  quite

sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, how this issue was raised  and

why it was raised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a presumption in somebody's mind that the

Government is putting pressure to bear on the staff of

the  Assembly.  Otherwise, how does  the  question  of

independence  arise? "Either you cut this  report  and

put  in this thing." There is not the slightest  basis

for  anyone to suspect that improper pressure is being

brought to bear on the staff of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think the Finance Minister is really now

suffering  from  the  ill effects  of  our  continuous

sittings. There has been no suggestion that  there  is

any  pressure  from  anybody on  anybody.  What  I  am

interested  in is this, that the checks  and  balances

should  be  such  that  there  would  not  even  be  a

suspicion of doubt in the minds of the Assembly  staff

that  somebody could bring pressure to hear  on  them.

The system should be such that nobody from any side of

the House could bring pressure to bear on the Assembly

staff.  That is the point I wish to make.  Surely  the

Minister  for Finance can understand that the  present

position  is  such that if there were an  unreasonable

Minister  for Finance, such as somebody not  like  our

present  Minister, it could become difficult. That  is

the  point  I  am  trying to make.  The  Minister  for

Finance must accept that position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise really

to endorse the point made by the Minister for Finance.

I do not think the survival of parliamentary democracy

in  Malaya  is  really in Malaya or  Malaysia.  Either

parliamentary democracy survives or it is  changed  to

some other form of government. It does not depend upon

the  question of whether some 15 or 20 persons in  the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly are in the  Government

service or in the Legislative Assembly service. I mean

these  are forms and trappings which are desirable  if

they  fit  the actual conditions. More important  than

that,  I  am  sure  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  is

genuinely and sincerely interested in seeing that  the

form of government is not changed for the worse. I say

we could better spend our time ensuring that by seeing

that the organs of the State are not undermined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>



and  altogether gone. Then you will have a Legislature

here  and  everybody will say "Ah, yes,  that  is  the

edict  from the Legislature." But where is the  where-withal to carry out the edicts of the Legislature?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more important factors which will

decide whether or not the democratic free will of  the

people expressed at regular intervals during elections

can  continue. One of them depends really not so  much

upon  the  formalism, the ritual or the constitutional

guarantees.   I  am  not  saying  that  constitutional

guarantees  are not important and that  things  should

not  be under-written as hard as they can be. But what

I  would  like to remind the House is that it is  more

important  not  only the people in this  Chamber,  the

representatives  of the people play according  to  the

rules  of  the  Chamber,  but  that  political  forces

outside  are not allowed to get out of hand to prevent

the  free  inter-play  in a free democratic  exchange.

That  is really the reality of the power. We are  here

concerned  with the facade. Not unnaturally  when  the

Member  for  Cairnhill  was  in  charge,  he  was  not

interested in the facade, but he was interested in the

reality.  And  the reality is not in this  Chamber - the

nice  and sweet things that are done. If you  want  to

prevent  the system from taking a turn for the  worse,

then  other things have to be done. One of  the  first

things  we  should do in this Chamber  to  maintain  a

semblance  of  democracy is to see that  there  is  no

abuse of the privileges of Members: that there is none

of   the   distortion  and  malicious  lying  of   the

intentions  of  this House and so  on.  That  is  more

important - the  prestige  of  the  Chamber;  more  than

whether  the Clerk, the Second Clerk or the  Reporters

are  in  the  Government service or in the Legislative

Assembly  service. That is a triviality. If, in  fact,

people outside come to the conclusion that this  is  a

mad  House - quite frankly, the Members of the  Barisan

Sosialis (particularly the Member for Upper Serangoon)

told  me this, that the last time when we raised' the.

question  of privilege in connection with  the  Member

for Hong Lim, who properly resigned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>



when  the  crucial  moment came. Outside  amongst  the

Chinese, they said that the Assembly is a very strange

place - "How is it that you can, tell lies  there  and

nothing  happens? A very curious thing!" I think  that

is  more  important, that you do  not  come  here  and

reduce  the  value of this forum by slowly denigrating

ourselves by a process of systematic disregard of  the

rules   of  decency,  systematic  distortion  of   the

motivation of things that are done here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody in town knows that a, debate went on for 12

to  13 days. Once the Member for Cairnhill had to call

for a quorum. When it was counted there were less than

13.  I  am sorry, Sir, to have mentioned forum. It  is

uppermost in my mind, because there is one due  to  be

recorded   tomorrow,  I  am  told.  The   Member   for

Queenstown said he was not given a chance to speak  in

the Chamber. He wants to speak here first. We have now

invited  him  to  speak to millions  of  Malayans  and

Malaysians, over to Borneo on the short-wave.  But  we

were told that this is a mockery of democracy. In  the

name  of  Western  parliamentary democracy,  they  say

this,  that  and the other. It is all in the  Standing

Orders, adopted unanimously in this Assembly by  them.

We  played according to the rules. They said, "No"  to

our motion on Thursday last. There was no protest.  It

was,  their  right to say no. General assent  was  not

given.  We  could not debate the parents' appeal  for

police protection. We lost two days - Friday and Monday.

The  pickets disappeared on Tuesday after  the  motion

was  passed,  because  so far, in  the  minds  of  the

people,  a  motion  carried in this  House  does  have

certain political consequences. Therefore, things were

done.  But  they held it up for two days.  They  said,

"No" on Thursday. We could not debate it on Friday. We

had  to wait till Monday. We passed it on Monday. Then

on  Tuesday the pickets disappeared. But what did they

say?  When we worked according to the rules, to  which

they agreed, and which were unanimously adopted - says

the  Standing Order, "... with effect pursuant  to  a

resolution  of  the  Legislative  Assembly   on   29th

December, 1959" - they said it was undemocratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>



and they walked out. It was with a sense of foreboding

that the Member for Cairnhill called for a quorum.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Forum?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quorum. Their own Barisan

Sosialis  Members were bored to tears. They left  this

Chamber.  They  could not stand it themselves.  Papers

coming  in;  the  typewriter working  over-time;  more

papers being fed. You were a little lenient, Sir,  and

so were we. People were reading speeches. I mean words

and phrases in Mandarin polished and glittering like a

beautiful sapphire -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One minute left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed, Sir, I cannot play

tribute  to  the  flowery eloquence  of  some  of  the

Members of the Barisan Sosialis. They suddenly  become

literary  geniuses. But we allowed this to  pass.  But

what did they say when we said they could talk for  19

hours? They could not talk relevantly for 19 hours.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member for Farrer Park

wishes to say something. One minute more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. Two seconds, Sir, just to

make  one  last  point. I say that is  more  important

about  parliamentary democracy - whether it survives  or

not   in  the  minds  of  the  people - than  all   the

constitutional   guarantees   or   establishment    of

guarantees and whether their pensions are paid by  the

Assembly or by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister has referred to my calling a quorum.  When  I

called  the  quorum, it was a Member of the Government

who was then speaking and there were only four Members

on the Government side left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I deeply admire the

Prime  Minister. When he is in a fix, he is a complete

adept  at  swinging the debate away from the point.  I

watched him with admiration and saw how neatly he  got

out  of  the  fix in regard to the word "consultation"

where the Member for Nee Soon was concerned. Now he is

trying it on me!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really Mr Speaker, Sir, these things are important.

The  Prime  Minister himself knows  it.  It  is  the

"trappings" of democracy that saved him about three or

four days ago. Let him not forget that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How is that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, the motion from this Assembly

protecting the rights of an Assemblyman got him out of

the  educational difficulties. Let the Prime  Minister

not forget that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He used it to purpose. And why not?

Therefore, Mi. Speaker, Sir, let us not talk about the

trivialities  of  the  democratic  system.  There   is

nothing  trivial  about the democratic  system.  Every

little thing is important. It has its place. It  falls

into  place and builds up the whole system. Therefore,

I  ask  the  Prime  Minister not to retract  from  the

statement  which  he made in thi5  House  that  he  is

willing  to consider having a Committee to  look  into

the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, yes. Nothing will be

retracted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $635,970 for Head 4 ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 5 be

reduced by $100.*

*The same amendment stood in the names of Inche Mohamed Ali bin Alwi and Mrs Seow Peck Leng.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to touch upon the question of not only the independence of the Public Service Commission, but the impression that the public of

Singapore   should  have,  that  the  Public   Service

Commission is, in fact, independent; that the  members

composing   the   Public  Service  Commission,   their

political   associations   and   affiliations,   their

personal connections with Ministers are such  that  an

impression  will not be created in the  minds  of  the

people that the Public Service Commission is one  with

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>



and  that  it  has become an instrument of  Government

policy rather than an independent body established for

establishment  purposes with the  intent  and  purpose

that  this arm - this democratic arm, if I  may  bore

the  Prime Minister with that phrase - should serve the

public  services as such, and not adumbrate the policy

of  the  Government with regard to what the Government

think the Public Service should do or sold not do.  In

that  respect. Mr Speaker, it is important  that  the

members who form this Commission should, like Caesar's

wife, be above reproach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the recent inquiry where the Member for Hong

Lim  was  before  the  Chua Commission,  a  number  of

persons  from  the  Public  Service  Commission   gave

evidence,  of  whom  one was  Mr  Lim  Kim  San.  The

question was asked of Mr Lim Kim San whether he was a

member  of  the People's Action Party. The answer  was

yes.  A further question following on that was whether

he  had  made any contribution to the People's  Action

Party.  The  answer  was yes. But the  question  which

should  have followed on it was never asked. I do  not

know  why.  But it was never asked. The question  that

should  have  been asked was, "How much?"  That  is  a

question which is exercising the minds of the  public,

lithe answer had been $10, perhaps it might have  been

nothing.  But  if  the  answer had  been  $100,000  or

$10,000, surely. Mr Speaker, Sir, it places  Mr  Lim

Kim San vis-a-vis the Public Service Commission in  an

unhappy position.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great pity that question was not asked, and

that  no statement was made on it. The result is  that

it  is felt that certain members of the Public Service

Commission are intimately connected with the  People's

Action  Party. Therefore, following on, that  premise,

the  suggestion is that people who are inclined to the

P.A.P. way of thinking, irrespective of how good or  how

bad  they might be as civil servants, get preferential

treatment  before the Commission. I am not shooting  a

line on this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker, Sir. I can assure the Prime Minister  of

this,  because people are talking like  that  and  the

civil  servants  are  talking and  thinking  in  those

terms. It is therefore important for the Government 10

declare  that  this is not so and  to  clear  all  the

members  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  on  the

question of whether they are sympathetic to the P.A.P.

way   of  political  thinking  or  whether  they  were

appointed merely because the Government thought it was

merely  an  extension  of the arm  of  Government  for

appointment  purposes and not for political  purposes.

It  is important because if the public services  as  a

whole  got  the impression that promotions were  being

effected  not  on service merits hut on  other  merits

totally  unconnected  with and  unrelated  to  service

conditions and service merits, then the whole  of  the

civil  service surely must deteriorate. Therefore,  it

is  of public importance to have a complete, fair  and

open statement from the Government as to whether these

suspicions which are now being voiced and talked about

have  any foundation at all. I think the name  of  Mr

Lim Kim San should, in fairness to him, he cleared. He

has  been given honourable mention by the Minister for

Finance  as  somebody who is doing a great service  to

the public. Mr Speaker, I myself know Mr Lim Kim San

as  a very able gentleman. I have nothing against him,

but I think he is holding a public appointment of some

importance,  and therefore it is necessary  and  vital

that  his  name and his connection with  the  People's

Action Party should he cleared in order that the  good

name of the Public Service Commission be maintained so

that  it might effectively carry out the purposes  for

which it was appointed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I only want

to  speak about a number of difficulties and questions

on  the Public Service Commission because we feel,  as

it  should be, that the independence of this  Assembly

should  be  enforced by the Public Service Commission.

What  I  would  like  to know is  this  - would  it  be

possible  to get an explanation of the resignation  of

the Chairman of the Public Service Commission?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>



Apart  from that, who is the prospective Chairman?  In

my opinion, Mr Speaker, it is better to have - as in the

P.A.P. today  there are so many communities -  in  this

Public  Service  Commission members of different  races

and communities, like Malays, Indians and so on. It  is

not  because  I am not satisfied with the services  but

because, Mr Speaker, outside this Assembly people  are

talking about it. If you do not believe me, you can ask

members  of  the  Police,  immigration  officials   and

customs  about appointments to higher ranks.  They  are

not  satisfied though they have served for a long  time

and  have  qualified  in  the  national  language.  But

because  of  several factors regarding  qualifications,

graduates of Nanyang University have been appointed  to

higher  posts. Because of the hope of independence  for

this  country, members of other races should also  hold

such  posts. I would like to have a reply, because this

has  been discussed in U.M.N.O., especially in the East

Division, and I have been given the duty to communicate

this  to  this Assembly. On the appointments to  higher

posts  based  on special privileges to the  Malays,  as

mentioned in my questions to the Minister for  Finance,

out  of  four of them, they took only one, Inche  Anwar

Ibrahim,  who  is now in the Ministry of Education.  He

has  been  appointed to a higher post. But as  for  the

three  others, Mr Speaker, it appears to me that  they

are  not appointed to higher posts, but get by  way  of

salaries appointments in name only. The appointment  to

higher posts is exaggerated in the newspapers. I hope I

could  get a clearer explanation from the Minister  for

Education.  I just communicate to the Assembly  what  I

have been told to do.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I notice under Head 5 - Public Service Commission, there

is one Chairman, one Deputy Chairman and three members.

That  makes  five. I believe none of  the  five  is  a

woman.  Sir, every year more and more girls pass  their

School  Certificate examination, their  Chinese  Middle

III  or  their pre-university II examination, and  more

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>



more  are  graduating from the University of  Singapore

and Nanyang University. There are also more and more of

them graduating as teachers from the Teachers' Training

College  in  the  English. Chinese,  Malay  and  Indian

sections.  Most of these women, Sir, are absorbed  into

Government service. I had a chat with the Minister  for

Education and I asked him whether it was true that more

and  more women were being absorbed into the Government

service.  His  reply  was, "Of  course,  otherwise  our

society  would  not be progressing." Sir,  I  was  just

wondering whether it would not be a sign of progress in

our  society  to have one or two women  in  the  Public

Service  Commission. When the Public Service Commission

was  first  appointed  some  years  ago,  there  was  a

comparatively  smaller  number of  women  entering  the

Government  service.  Now that the  number  is  rapidly

swelling, is it not logical and fair to have  at  least

one woman as a member of the Public Service Commission?

Sir,  I  am  not suggesting that the Government  should

increase their expenditure by enlarging the Commission.

Neither  am  I  suggesting that  one  unfortunate  male

member should be replaced by a woman. But I do ask  the

Government,  if on future occasions they have  to  make

more  appointments,  whether they would  keep  this  in

mind.  Because it is not only for my sake  or  for  the

sake  of  women in Singapore, but for the sake  of  all

women  throughout  the  world  who  are  interested  in

raising  the status of women. I am not trying to  be  a

feminist - it  seems  to  be quite  a  joke,  I  hear - and

neither  must  this question be treated as unimportant,

as  is  every other question concerning women. Whenever

such  a  question comes up, it is greeted with laughter

and  treated  as if it is unimportant. It is  important

enough,  Sir,  to find a place in the U.N.  Charter  on

Human  Rights  where they ask for equal privileges  and

equal   treatment  for  women.  The  P.A.P. has   also

advocated  the  same  principle.  That  is  why  I   am

appealing  to the Government to give this a thought  in

making future appointments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, for one moment I thought we

were in the United Nations! However, we endeavour to

look after, as best we can, human rights, women's

rights, Assemblymen's rights, Malay rights -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You have given her ideas!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - and we try to make everybody

happy,  Sir,In the process of making everybody happy,

we have also to keep the machinery of the State going.

One  of the parts of the State machinery is the Public

Service Commission. Both the Member for Cairnhill  and

his  predecessor, the Member for Anson, will know that

this  was  one  of  the items that  was  acrimoniously

debated   in   the   course  of   our   constitutional

conferences in London. First, the Member for Anson led

the  delegation - he led two subsequent ones.  On  both

occasions  there was acrimonious debate on whether  or

not  should inherit the former P.S.C. It was generally

agreed, after a bit of acrimony, that it was the right

of  the  Government to nominate the P.S.C. there  are

valid,  cogent reasons for that conclusion  which  the

Member for Cairnhill, as Chief Minister then, pressed

and  the  Secretary of State for the  Colonies  agreed

with  him. For the benefit of his colleague the Member

for   Farrer  Park,  who  was  not  present   at   the

conferences,  may  I  enumerate some  of  the  reasons

advanced jointly? I think the Member for Geylang Serai

will  bear  witness with me. Firstly,  the  Government

that  comes  into  office will be inheriting  a  State

machine  which had been built up largely by expatriate

officers in the past. Therefore, it was necessary that

the  men  who  were  to decide on a  large  number  of

promotions   which  were  going  to  take   place   as

Malayanisation progressed should reflect the political

thinking  of  the new generation of rulers  who  would

take the place of the British administrators. The  men

who  were appointed by former Governors reflected  the

thinking  of  one  era. The men who have  taken  their

places  must  reflect the thinking  of  the  new  age.

Secondly, it is impossible for the Government to be at

variance with the background, the thinking and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>



the  philosophy  of  members of the  P.S.C. for  long

without there being serious acrimony. Behind all  this

facade   of   independence  of  the   judiciary,   the

independence of the Legislature - when I used  the  word

"facade"  I  used it in a very liberal sense,  in  the

sense  that behind the constitutional guarantees,  the

outward  symbols of separateness, there  must  be  the

reality of effective government. If you have a  P.S.C.

that keeps on promoting or recruiting people whom  the

Government feels it has no confidence in, then a point

is  reached  where things come to a break. The  Member

for  Farrer  Park  is not altogether  unaware  of  the

affairs of government. He has been in local government

for years. You face the same problem there. If you are

to inherit a machine manned in key positions by people

on  whom  you  place no reliance, then  how  does  the

machine  work?  It  is as simple as  that.  Therefore,

written  into the Constitution as a safeguard  against

variance  of opinion of the P.S.C. and the  Ministers,

the Permanent Secretary appointments are to be made by

the Prime Minister from a list given by the P.S.C.  If

the Prime Minister does not like it, he sends back the

list  and  asks for another list. The office of  State

Advocate-General  is  an  appointment  of  the   Prime

Minister.   The   office  of  Chief  Justice   is   an

appointment of the Prime Minister. The office  of  the

Chairman of the Arbitration Court is an appointment of

the Prime Minister. The office of the Speaker, Sir, is

an appointment of the Government Party.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind all the theories of separation of power,

behind all the niceties of the independence of action,

judgment,  decision, the checks and  balances  of  the

democratic  system,  there  must  be  the  reality  of

effective cohesiveness. We have appointed five men  on

the  P.S.C. - six  so far; the present  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara was our first appointment; he vacated his  post

on  the  P.S.C. when  he became the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.  They were men unconnected with the P.A.P. in

the  sense  that they were politically  involved.  The

rules  of the Constitution were observed. But  let  me

tell the Member for Farrer Park this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



Obviously we would never appoint anybody in  whom  we

have  no  confidence to the P.S.C. or to any board  on

which  we  have  the right of appointment.  The  first

thing   we  must  have  is  confidence  in  the  man's

judgment. How do you get that confidence? Because  you

know him. If you do not know him, how do you know  you

can rely on his judgment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to clear Mr Lim Kim San. First of all, I

think  the  Member for Farrer Park was wrong  when  he

said that Mr Lim Kim San said that he was a member of

the  P.A.P.  He  never  was.  He  never  said  in  the

Commission  of  Inquiry that he was a  member  of  the

P.A.P.  He said that he was not a member of the P.A.P.

He  was asked whether he gave a donation to the P.A.P.

After  he  was  appointed, he was  approached  by  the

Treasurer of the Party who came to know him because he

was  appointed the Chairman of the Housing  Board  and

the  Housing Board and Allocation Committees  to  help

him in awarding points and so on. The Treasurer of the

Party,  my  Political Secretary (Mr Jek Yuen  Thong),

got to know him and got a contribution from him. He is

doing  the  job for nothing in the Housing Board.  The

Member  for  Farrer  Park knew that  we  offered  that

appointment on the Housing Board to a friend  of  his.

It  was a tough job because the Minister then was  the

Member for Hong Lim and we needed another tough man to

do  the  job properly so that the checks and  balances

could work. But the reality of power is this - you  have

a  tough  Minister - whatever you  do,  the  balance  of

authority  is finally decided by who has to carry  the

can,  for he who carries the responsibility must  ipso

facto  have the right to decide. Without the slightest

compunction, I say that I would not, nor would any  of

my colleagues, appoint anybody to the P.S.C. or to any

other authority if we did not have confidence in  him.

We only appoint people in whom we have confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think Mr Lim Kim San has been unjustly

mentioned  in  this context - probably unintentionally.

But I say this, that it was because of his performance

in   the  P.S.C. and  in  the  Polytechnic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



Board  of Management, where the Deputy Prime Minister was and is

the Chairman, that we asked him to become a member  of

the Housing Board. He is a man of considerable ability

and  of no mean stature. He is doing these things  for

nothing and I hate to believe -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Can I have one or two minutes on

this amendment, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not see that the Member for

Queenstown  gave notice of any amendment. So  I  think

the Prime Minister is entitled to carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I want to make this point,

that  Mr Lim Kim San is not there because he is going

to  promote P.A.P. men. I am quite prepared to have  a

public  inquiry on any aspect of it. In the course  of

the  inquiry into the allegations made by  the  Member

for  Hong  Lim, I myself gave evidence as to  how  the

P.S.C. worked  and operated in certain circumstances.

It  is  utterly ridiculous to make these  allegations.

Mr  Lirn  Kim  San is there because  I  rely  on  his

judgment.  If the Member for Farrer Park really  feels

that  there  is this feeling that you  have  to  be  a

P.A.P. member before you get promotion, then I say let

us   have  a  public  inquiry.  Let  us  review  every

promotion  made. To my mind, it is utterly nonsensical

to suggest it, because there is no member of the civil

service who is a member of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No member of the civil service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Of the civil service, nor of the

P.S.C. To my knowledge, no member of the civil service

in Division I is a member of the P.A.P. Apart from the

Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, I

know  of  no  other Division I officers because  civil

service  officers usually like to be unconnected  with

these  matters.  I am sorry this allegation  has  been

made -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Goh Sin Tub.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - and I say it it is persisted in -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Goh Sin Tub.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A member of the civil service -

Mr  Goh Sin Tub - has been mentioned. He applied but  he

was  not accepted. That is a fact. He applied to  he  a

member of the P.A.P. but he was not accepted. He got no

promotion  on account of either being or not  being  in

the  P.A.P. I say, have a public inquiry at  any  time.

But I must tell the Member for Farrer Park this - that he

has  to get the facts and he has to present them at the

inquiry, and I think it is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I just deal with the Member for Kampong

Kembangan?  I  will  give another  opportunity  to  the

Member for Farrer Park at some other time. We can  then

review  this matter. I speak with sonic heat because  I

have  to defend the institution, particularly when  its

members  cannot  be here to defend themselves.  I  have

just  gone  to the phone to check my facts  about  this

business  of  Mr  Lim Kim San being a  member  of  the

P.A.P. Mr Lin1 Eng Bee resigned because he was in  bad

health.  He was advised by Prof. Monterio to consult  a

specialist  in London. Thereafter he probably  has  to

convalesce for about six months. The post will have  to

be filled substantively at some time or other unless he

can  come  back and take on the job. It was partly  the

nature of the duties and so on which has contributed to

his being unwell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Member for Kampong Kembangan asked

who is to be successor. There is an acting Chairman  al

the  moment. It is not easy to ask a man to  take  this

duty. Singapore is in a peculiar situation. If you  are

in a settled and established society, you have a lot of

retired professional men.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The time is up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $184,490 for Head 5 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the salary of the Prime Minister has

been increased by $450 a month. He has other allowances

for being in Government, and also transport facilities.

In   addition,   he  has  an  allowance  for   learning

languages. Why must his salary be increased by  such  a

big  sum?  Does the Prime Minister know that our  poor

people  get  only  a  few dollars in public  assistance

every year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir,I must

insist  that there is no reading from prepared scripts.

The Member has a right to put his question, but we have

a  long tirade from a prepared script, particularly  as

the Mandarin to my ear, Sir, does not sound the same as

what I usually hear from him. I must ask him to refrain

from reading from prepared scripts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. I think in Committee of Supply we

must  not  have any prepared scripts, or if  there  are

prepared scripts they can be considered as notes. There

should  not  be  obvious reading of a prepared  script.

This is the Committee of Supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this note was drafted by myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the general election the P.A.P. promised to

improve  the  livelihood of the people. But  today  the

Prime Minister has improved himself. I do not know  how

he can explain this way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

first I wish to tell the ex-Parliamentary Secretary  to

the Minister for Education that the salary of the Prime

Minister  was  originally $3,500 a month.  It  was  the

Member for Anson, when he was Chief Minister, who fixed

this  salary.  The second Chief Minister,  namely,  the

Member  for Cairnhill, also received $3,500 a month  as

his salary. I am very disappointed in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



ex-Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Education.  He knew that we reduced the allowances  of

our public servants because we wanted to economise  on

Government expenditure. That was why in July  1959  we

reduced the allowances of our public servants. At  the

same  time,  we reduced the salaries of the  Ministers

and    the   Parliamentary   Secretaries.   The    ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  himself  drew  a  salary  of

$1,500  a month, but later on it was reduced to $1,250

a  month.  We  made progress in the Government  partly

because of the support and help of the people who  are

now  in the Barisan Sosialis. We did this so that  the

economy  of our State would be more stable.  But  when

our  economy  improved and things turned out  for  the

better, we decided to restore the allowances in  full.

I  regret  very  much to have heard the  arguments  he

raised  just  now. If he had not been  manipulated  by

others,  he would still have been receiving  $1,500  a

month   now.  [Interruption]  Perhaps  he   does   not

understand  the interjection of the Member for  Farrer

Park.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that if the ex-Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister  for Education had continued  to  be

Parliamentary Secretary, he would have been  receiving

the  same  amount  of salary. But  his  dream  is  now

shattered,  and there is another person assisting  the

Minister  to  take charge of education  problems.  How

weak is the memory of our ex-Parliamentary Secretary!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps it would be convenient for

me  to take items (2) and (3) together. Item (2) deals

with  Parliamentary Secretary, and item  (3)  Personal

Secretary (Political).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think perhaps item (2) could

be  taken together with item (1) because it deals with

the  same principle of increase. But item (3), I think

there are other aspects that may be debated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I agree to that,

Mr  Speaker. I believe my ex-Parliamentary  Secretary

and  the other Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen will agree

that the values of the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



Anson and the Member for Cairnhill are not far off the

values  of  our Ministers in respect of the work  they

can  contribute.  They do not  mind  at  all  if  they

themselves can enjoy such a salary. But we are drawing

this  salary because we work for the interests of  the

people  and  not  for  ourselves.  This  has   to   be

understood clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers, of course, must be put on a higher status

than  that  of the ex-Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister   for   Education.  And  since  Parliamentary

Secretaries  have  had their salaries  and  allowances

restored,  then, of course, Ministers must  also  have

their salaries and allowances restored. That is simple

reasoning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member also mentioned allowances in

respect  of  transport,  and  other  fees.  I   cannot

remember what it is. Would he please mention it again?

[Interruption] Oh, yes, he mentioned the  learning  of

languages.  That  is  to  help our  communication  and

conversation with our ex-Parliamentary Secretary. That

is  why  we  had to spend time learning  languages  in

spite of the fact that we had much work to do. When he

was   Parliamentary  Secretary  in  the  Ministry   of

Education, I used to encourage him to learn languages.

Perhaps  he  has  given up learning languages  due  to

pressure  of work and time. But how is it that  as  an

Assemblyman  he could draw an allowance  for  learning

languages and I could not? I should also have the same

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned just now another kind of allowance.

What was that? I cannot remember.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Speaker fortunately is at an

advantage in respect of these interjections. He  hears

them  but  they  do  not  reach  the  hearing  of  the

interpreters. I ask hon. Members on the other side, as

far  as  they  can,  not to interject.  They  have  an

opportunity, of course, of speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I want to make the

whole  position clear. After the Hong Lim  by-election

in  May  this  year,  our Ministers and  Parliamentary

Secretaries decided to resign and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



hand over our responsibilities to the people. But it

was the Assemblymen opposite who insisted on our

carrying on. At the same time, they were calculating on

becoming Acting Prime Minister and Acting Deputy Prime

Minister. The Member for Nee Soon told the present

Minister for Labour that they had already drafted out

their plan. How nice! They wanted to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Hon. The Prime Minister

wanders so far away from the actual topic under

discussion that there will not be much time left for

the other Members who have given notices of amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is very closely related to the question before  us.

They have accused us of having self-interest to such an

extent  that  we  have restored our salaries.  When  we

assumed  office, we had cut our salaries. Now  we  have

fully  restored  our salaries. Is it reasonable  for  a

Minister  to  receive a salary lower  than  that  of  a

Parliamentary Secretary? Another reason: they wanted to

be  Ministers  and  Parliamentary  Secretaries - perhaps

four Ministers and five Parliamentary Secretaries. They

calculated  that if the Ministers would  not  carry  on

with their duties and resigned, then there was a golden

opportunity to take over. That is why they have already

planned their future shadow Cabinet.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know how all that

statement  ties up with the complaint which the  Member

for  Serangoon Gardens has made - that the salary of  the

Prime Minister has increased.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On this question of

restoration  of salaries of Parliamentary  Secretaries,

the   Assemblymen  opposite  have  given   notices   of

amendments in respect of Ministers' salaries and so on.

I  suggest  we debate all these amendments together  as

otherwise  we  will be debating over a length  of  time

without end. Would you agree to that, Mr Speaker?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. The debate should now range over

not  only  the increase of salary of the Prime Minister

but  also  the  increase made  in  the  salary  of  the

Parliamentary  Secretary, item  (2)  of  subhead  1.  I

suggest the debate should also range over the increases

made   in  the  salaries  of  all  Ministers  and   all

Parliamentary  Secretaries, so that we  can  deal  with

that topic now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Member for Serangoon Gardens would like

to  add  to  his  statement in regard to  Parliamentary

Secretaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

on   this   question,  I  do  not  know   whether   the

Parliamentary  Secretaries have had a full  restoration

of  their salaries because the public servants have had

their salaries and allowances restored. Is it so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the livelihood of the people was the same

three   years   ago.   Why   should   these   so-called

representatives  of  the  people  receive   such   high

salaries?  Is  it possible to allocate  the  allowances

paid to them to better use, such as public assistance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have clearly

stated  that this is only meant to restore the salaries

as  they  were  in  July  1959.  I  think  the  purpose

underlying   the  question  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis

Assemblymen  is this. They have a motive  because  they

have  asked why certain pub1ic assistance has not  been

increased  whereas  the Ministers' salaries  have  been

raised. I would say that the Member for Thomson, who is

a  friend of Mr Rajendra and who is in the same  front

as  he is, had suggested restoration from July 1959.  I

think  it is because they are in the same front as  the

Communists.   He  understands  it  well  himself.   Mr

Rajendra  understands  it very well.  He  said  it  was

unreasonable and explained why it could not be done.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do want to impress upon the Prime

Minister  that the time now is Opposition time.  If  he

continues  in  that  strain,  there  will  not  be  any

opportunity  for other Members who have to  move  their

amendments and speak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Lastly, I wish to

ask them: if they sympathise with the people in their

sufferings, then I would suggest that they have their

own allowances cut. That would be a very fair thing to

do. We all contribute something to the aid of the poor.

If the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen accept this, then

we will also agree to the cut in our allowances too, so

that they will have a chance too of proving their words

in deeds. Otherwise people will say that they are

phoney.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> I think the Prime

Minister  is talking through his hat. He is  suggesting

that  Assemblymen should cut their allowances. He knows

that  there  are lots of Assemblymen who  do  not  have

money -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and everybody is unlike a lawyer

who   has   an  office,  plenty  of  money,  big   cars



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I believe, Sir, - I cannot quote

offhand - the Prime Minister himself at one time advanced

the  suggestion that Assemblymen should he  paid  more,

because -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are not discussing the

allowance of Assemblymen, but only in so far  as  there

has  been a suggestion to cut their allowance. The hon.

Member,  I think, has made his point - that it would  be

perhaps a burden on some Assemblymen if their allowance

were cut.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I, on a point of order, just

point   out - and   I   do   not   want   this   to    be

misinterpreted - that  we  are  against  the  Member  for

Queenstown's  proposal  that Assemblymen's  allowances

should be increased.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is not a point of order. I

think the amendment has been sufficiently debated. Does

the hon. Member wish for a vote?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go into this, I would beg of you to see

to   it  that  the  debate  under  this  Head  is   not

unnecessarily long. During the debate on the first  two

amendments,  we took 25 minutes. The Prime Minister,  I

think,  took 20 minutes just to explain that it  was  a

restoration  of self-imposed pay cuts. In  fact,  as  I

pointed out in this Assembly before, it was nothing but

the  P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis. We do  not  want

that  to  happen, particularly in this  Budget  debate,

which  has  a  very tight schedule.  There  is  also  a

guillotine  on  the time allotted for matters  of  this

kind.  Out  of 22 amendments, Sir, I have 16  under  my

name.  As a result of too much time spent on the  first

two  amendments,  we  have to rush  through  the  other

amendments under the Head of Prime Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Prime Minister to explain why it is

that in the case of Political Secretaries, an increase

of  $250  is  suggested. There is no such thing  as  a

restoration of pay cut, because there was no  pay  cut

imposed on Political Secretaries. I would like  it  to

be  understood here, Sir, that I have nothing  against

the   Political  Secretary  in  the  Prime  Minister's

Office.  I know him personally. But I am raising  this

as  a  matter  of principle. The Political  Secretary,

Sir, according to the Government, is there to tell the

Minister concerned about the pulse of the people.  The

political Secretary in question, Sir, contested the by-election  in  Hong Lim. He went to  Hong  Lim  as  the

defender  of  the  P.A.P. and lost. He  was,  therefore,

rejected  by  the electorate of Hong Lim.  If  Members

will  remember, when the P.A.P. Government  came  into

power,  they  made short shrift of all candidates  who

lost  in the general elections, so much so that  those

in  the  Opposition who had been active  in  community

centres and other voluntary organisations were  shoo'd

off  by  the then Minister for Labour and Law  on  the

grounds  that  they were unwanted by the people.  They

were  rejected by the electorate of the division  they

stood  for.  Therefore, they should not be  given  the

chance to serve the people in any capacity whatsoever.

Here we have the case of a Political Secretary who had

been rejected by the electorate of Hong Lim. Yet he is

the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister. Sir, I

think, as a result of that, it is not out of place  to

ask  the  Prime Minister whether or not this Political

Secretary drew any salary during the time of  the  by-election campaign.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Mohd. Ali, not speaking? Dr Lee

Siew Choh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will not take very much time,

Sir.  We were told that the past Political Secretaries

like  Fong Swee Suan, Lim Ching Siong, and S. Woodhull

were  made Political Secretaries because they were  to

serve  as  a  bridge  between the Government  and  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. That is an

utterly incorrect statement to inform the House of.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. The Prime

Minister  will be able to correct that later  on.  Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, as far as I understand,

Sir, they served as Political Secretaries because  the

Prime Minister insisted -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come on!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - that if they wanted to show that

they  were  loyal to the P.A.P., they had to  shoulder

the  responsibility of Government policy. The Minister

for  Finance  defended  Lim  Ching  Siong.  The  Prime

Minister  also defended all of them. But we know  what

the  real purpose was. The real purpose, Sir,  was  to

use the names of these persons as a cover for anything

which  the  Government thought was unpopular  so  that

they  could enlist the support of workers in  whatever

policies they wanted to implement. But what happens to

the present Political Secretaries? I do not want to be

personal, Sir. I know them personally myself.  But  of

what use are they now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You will be surprised!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Are they serving as bridges

between the Party in power and the people? Or are they

mere translators? You will remember, Sir, in the first

Session that the Prime Minister himself said that  but

for  the  fact  that they had a Malay  translator  who

could  translate  the  speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara,  it  was possible that the real  speech  would

have  been  misunderstood. As  far  as  we  know,  all

translators are only given a certain salary and  never

as  high as it is put down. Since the coffers  of  the

P.A.P. are  also  depleted  and  are  not  so  easily

replenished,   I   wonder  whether  they   need   more

contributions from the Political Secretaries and other

people like them. We have nothing personal against the

Political  Secretaries, Sir. If they  really  want  to

serve  their  purpose, they must be sent back  to  the

people.  They must not stay in air-conditioned offices

and  just  translate speeches and writings of  certain

people.  Such  jobs can easily be delegated  to  civil

servants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Cairnhill has asked a question

about  the pay of the Political Secretary to the Prime

Minister  during the by-election, I must mention  that

we know that the then acting Political Secretary never

received  a  single  cent. All the  money  which  that

Political Secretary was supposed to have received went

to  the coffers of the P.A.P. instead. If this is  not

political corruption, then we do not know what is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

on this question, my colleague has said quite a lot. I

just  want to ask why the salary of all these Personal

Secretaries (Political) is increased?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> To channel the debate. There seem to be

three  heads. One is the principle of whether  or  not

Political  Secretaries should be paid. That  has  been

raised by the Member for Queenstown. The second  point

is  the  increase of $250. I take it  that  it  is  an

increase  to  all Political Secretaries. We  can  deal

with that. Thirdly, I think possibly the question will

arise  in each particular Ministry whether a Political

Secretary  should be engaged. What  use  they  are.  I

would suggest then that we deal with the two heads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> All three would be convenient.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There may be an opinion that in one

Ministry  there  should not be a Political  Secretary.

But  I  will  make it quite clear that the debate  now

should  range, first, over the principle as to whether

a  Political  Secretary  is  necessary  at  all;  and,

secondly, the reason why there is an increase of $250.

Those  two  heads must be debated now  and  cannot  be

reopened  when  we  come  to the  other  supplementary

issue.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In view of your ruling, Sir, would

it be possible for the guillotine to be extended? 7.10

p.m. would therefore be too short.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, I cannot do that. When I settled

the  time,  I  did take into consideration  all  these

eventualities. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, on the principle, Sir. The

only people who have any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



right   to   question  the  principle   of   Political

Secretaries  are  the  Members from  the  S.P.A.  They

questioned  it  on the first occasion  or  the  second

occasion. We, together with the help of the 13 Barisan

Sosialis  Assemblymen  and the three  Members  of  the

U.P.P.,  defended  it. I need hardly  say,  Sir,  that

people  who  changed their minds  so  quickly  in  the

course  of  four months leaves others in doubt  as  to

whether they are stable, apart from financial matters,

Sir,Instability in financial matters is  one  thing,

particularly when one considers the loss of  earnings.

But  general instability - questioning basic  principles

which they supported and voted for - is another thing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mental

instability!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Oh, mental instability. I do not

want  to  delve into the medical side of these things.

But  I  am  told, Sir, that people who talk about  the

poor workers and social welfare benefits and so on -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps the Prime Minister

should talk with an eye on the clock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will, Sir - more than that. Apart

from keeping an eye on the clock, I have to watch  the

effect  of  what has been said on the Members  of  the

Opposition, because it either shortens or prolongs the

debate. If obviously a gleam of light filters through,

then  time is saved. The point I want to make is  that

if  a  person keeps four Alsatian dogs and feeds them,

how  can  he, in the name of democracy - Western  style

parliamentary democracy - say that we are ill  treating

the people and so on? It is very complicated. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister is talking

about himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Prime Minister has no

Alsatian dogs, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Prime Minister is the Alsatian dog!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am much obliged to the Member

for  Farrer Park. But I am the non-biting kind! I think

it  is an utter waste of time to debate the question of

principle  with the Members of the Barisan Sosialis  or

the  U.P.P.  They  were  the people  who  defended  and

supported it. They know full well the effectiveness  of

the   Political  Secretaries,  especially  the   former

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. He

had  his present Secretary-General there. He must  know

what  a useful man he was. To the Member for Cairnhill,

may  I  say  this?  He  knows very well  how  extremely

valuable  my Political Secretary is, and how  extremely

valuable  the  Political Secretary to the Minister  for

Culture  is.  I  am  sorry the  Member  for  Queenstown

believes that they only translate.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can translate, and translate many things, Sir.

You  can translate words. You can translate ideas. What

is  most  important is that there has  been  some  good

translation   of  ideas  into  action, much   to   the

discomfiture   of   the  Member  for   Queenstown,   in

particular, the discomfiture of his own colleague,  the

former  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Education.   He   had  a  chat  with  my  Parliamentary

Secretary  over the predecessor. Strangely  enough,  he

has  only  asked  a very simple question  of  principle

about  the  increase, which I now  propose  to  answer.

Obviously my Political Secretary is a man of  very  few

words  and  the few words he spoke sank home.  Why  the

increase?  When the salary was fixed at  $1,100,  their

position  vis-a-vis  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  was

taken into consideration. In any organisation there  is

a certain amount of formality, protocol; who gives whom

orders; whose authority over-rides whom. The salary  of

Parliamentary  Secretary was fixed at $1,500;  that  of

Political  Secretary was fixed at $1,350. Parliamentary

Secretaries  were  brought down to  $1,250.  Well,  the

adjustment was already made before the appointment - just

like the P.S.C., and if I may mention it, the Speaker's

emolument - it already contained the variable  allowance.

When we fixed the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



Political Secretary's salary, it was already after  the

pay  cuts;  so we fixed it at $1,100. When we  restored

the  pay cut, we restored it all round. May I say this,

Sir?  If  we  wanted just to give largesse  around,  we

could  fill  up all nine appointments, because  we  had

nine  appointments right from the word 'go'.  We  never

did.  We  have never appointed more than  five  or  six

Politica1 Secretaries. Mr Devan Nair resigned for  his

own personal reasons, and not because he disagreed with

the  Government: because he would have been accused  of

being a stooge of the Government. He knew the fight was

coming, and  if he was in receipt of pay as  Political

Secretary, they would say he did it because  he  was  a

Political  Secretary.  So he  resigned,  went  back  to

teaching,  and waited for the scrap which he  knew  was

coming.  Because once he knew Mr Lim Ching  Siong  and

Mr  Fong  Swee  Suan were going to play the  Communist

game,  then  the  fight  was  inevitable.  He  prepared

himself  from possible smear by resigning his  job  and

going back to teaching so that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How much did he get in all?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He only gets his salary as a

teacher. He has insured himself against any jibe by any

ignorant,  illiterate or mischievous people  by  making

sure  that  he is not open to damage. He has  given  no

hostage  to  fortune.  We  have  not  filled   up   the

appointments because there are no candidates available.

Before  Mr Jek contested the by-election, he  resigned

formally. After the election, when he was not returned,

I reappointed him. I am the man, Sir, who knows whether

or  not  he  is of valuable help to the Government.  Up

till  now  we have not been able to find the people  we

want.  We  could appoint anybody and fill  up  all  the

jobs.  As for the acting Political Secretary, when  Mr

Jek  was  at  Hong  Lim canvassing and  campaigning,  I

appointed our editor of Petir to be my acting Political

Secretary.  He  is  in  receipt  of  a  party   salary.

Everybody,  including  Ministers and  Assemblymen  - and

this is known to all Members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



the Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P.- pays his whole

salary to the Party and the Party then pays out to

each Assemblyman and each Parliamentary Secretary and

each Minister. We do not depend on anybody to help the

Party. We fought and built the Party on our own and we

are doing so now. And the man who was in receipt of a

salary is the editor of Petir. I gave him certain

extra duties -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As Political Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. To do what Mr Jek was doing

for me.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And received Government salary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. collected for him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And now to his discomfiture, he

went and joined the Barisan Sosialis and lost his  job

with  the  P.A.P. That is the pity of it all,  Sir. I

congratulate   the  chaps  who  manipulated   the   13

Assemblymen  into making them believe that  they  were

going to be Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister  and

draw  big  salaries. In the end they lost money.  They

all look thinner and hungrier now. They were extremely

unhappy  at  the thought of reducing the Assemblymen's

allowances.   The  Member  for  Queenstown   suggested

increasing  it. Be that as it may, I ask  each  Member

this  very simple question - which the public will  ask.

If  we  are  throwing public money away, why  have  we

never  filled up the jobs yet? There are nine jobs  to

give  away.  We  filled up six because  six  men  were

available, and we filled them up for good reasons. One

resigned to go back to teaching because he anticipated

the  day  when  we would part company and  they  would

smear  him. He did not want that. He did not  want  to

give  a  hostage to fortune. We knew two  had  already

gone  the  other  way and were waiting  for  the  open

conflict. Mr Woodhull in the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



of  Health was not with the other two, Sir, until very

recently.  He has decided to join the band-wagon  only

recently. Well, he takes the consequences. We had  two

fortunately - my   own  Political  Secretary   and   the

Political Secretary to the Minister for Culture - who we

knew were stout-hearted men. They went into the valley

in  the  shadow  of death and came  out  as  firm  of

conviction as when they went through the worst  of  it

all.  They did not believe they were going to get more

salary when they stuck with us. Everybody expected  us

to  go  down.  But they have conviction  and  courage,

which  is  more than what I can say for  some  of  the

others.  It is certainly more than what I can say  for

the  13  gentlemen sitting opposite, honourable though

they  may  be  by being in this Assembly,  because  we

fought  for  them on our symbol, P.A.P.,  and  on  our

programme.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first and

foremost,  I  am  not satisfied with  the  explanation

given by the Prime Minister that it was a readjustment

of  salary.  Sir,  in the case of  the  Ministers  and

Parliamentary  Secretaries,  I  accept  the  statement

because  those  salaries were drawn by  Ministers  and

Assistant Ministers of the previous Government. In the

case  of  a  Parliamentary Secretary, this was  a  new

appointment.  Then  to prove my  contention  that  the

statement of the Prime Minister is wrong, let me refer

him to page 427, Head 49. Ministry of Culture. Head 49

carries  with  it  two political appointments - Personal

Secretary (Political), i.e.. Political Secretary,  and

Publicity Liaison Secretary (Political), that is, Sir.

item  (3)  of  subhead 1. When we queried  the  salary

fixed  for the Publicity Liaison Secretary (Political)

at $1,400 - when Political Secretaries were paid $1,100 - it  was pointed out to us in this Assembly (and I have

the  Hansard  to prove it) that the Publicity  Liaison

Secretary was being paid $1,400 because of his greater

responsibilities.  Therefore,  there  was  already   a

relationship between the salary scale of the Political

Secretary and that of the Publicity Liaison Secretary.

Now, it will be seen from Head 49, item (3) of subhead

1,  that  the  salary of Publicity  Liaison  Secretary

still remains at $1,400.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



Therefore, as a result of that, I contend that that was

the  salary  fixed  for  the  job - Publicity  Liaison

Secretary   $1,400  and  Political  Secretary   $1,100.

Therefore, to increase an extra $250 for the  Political

Secretaries now is just to give extra money  to  people

who support the Party in power:.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the other explanation given by the

Prime  Minister  in  regard to his Political  Secretary

during  the  time  of  the  Hong  Lim  by-election,  he

disclosed a very scandalous state of affairs.  He  said

that at that time his Political Secretary resigned.  If

he  had  resigned, let it be. But what did he  do?  The

Prime  Minister filled up the post with the  editor  of

his paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Fill it up and then take the money

for his Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That was what he did. This is the

state  of  affairs the people of Singapore should  take

note  of. The Government is making use of votes in this

Assembly to enrich its own Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come on.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In other words, the editor of

Petir,  doing the job of Political Secretary,  was  not

qualified  to  receive the whole amount  since  he  was

already  paid  by  the Party to be the  editor  of  the

Petir.  Therefore,  whatever money  comes  in  is  just

political largesse distributed by the Government at the

expense of the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why do we not distribute to the

other seven? Tell me?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I will answer that. Why did he not

fill  up  all the nine posts? Because he did  not  have

enough Communist comrades to fill up all the posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come on.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He dare not now -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of order, is he making a

serious allegation that Mr Rahim Ishak, a Political

Secretary, is a Communist comrade? Because if he is,

I think Mr Rahim Ishak -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is not a point of order. The

Prime Minister will have an opportunity of speaking.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is indeed regrettable that the

Prime  Minister, who has been here for so  many  years,

does  not even know parliamentary procedure and  starts

talking  on a point of order when it is not a point  of

order. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am not suggesting who is a

Communist and who is not a Communist. What I do suggest

is  this.  The fact that the Political Secretaries  who

have  now  resigned have been labelled by  him  in  his

awful  disclosures  in  12  broadcasts  as  Communists,

fellow-travellers, Communist front men. Those  are  the

words  used  by the Prime Minister. So the  reason  why

there  were  some posts not filled is that he  had  not

enough Communist comrades there to contain. He need not

have  to use the posts, but he puts them in so that  in

case there are some Communist fellows whom he wants  to

contain, he will contain them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there are logical questions

which I think the Member for Cairnhill should answer if

he makes this scandalous allegation, if we want to fill

our party coffers, Sir, there are other simple ways  of

doing  it. The power of patronage of a government under

this Constitution is 10 times the power of patronage of

a government under his. We can account for every single

cent  the Party has received and spent, which  is  more

than  I can say for some other Parties, which he  knows

about.  We get nothing from America, as did the  Labour

Front  Party.  Nor do we fill our coffers  in  the  way

suggested  by  the  Member for Cairnhill - disreputable

and  dishonourable. These men work for their money.  So

did every one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Ministers,  every one  of  the  Parliamentary

Secretaries,  and every one of us who  contributes  to

keep  the Party going as a machine-not to get together

a  few  chaps at election time to fight the elections.

If  we  want to make the money for nothing,  we  could

have  filled up the nine posts. We have lots of  Party

workers   - editors,   assistant  editors,   organising

secretaries. We could have filled up every one of  the

nine  posts.  But  the people must be worth  something

before  we  put them there. It is as simple  as  that.

When I got the editor of Petir to take over, I had  to

have  one in my Ministry for various reasons.  Because

in  my capacity, I have charge of the Government,  the

City  Council,  and the Party. I had to have  somebody

there  who  could be on tab. When Mr Jek was  running

around fighting the Hong Lim by-election, I had to get

the  editor  of Petir to look after Mr Jek's  duties.

That  is all, and there is nothing wrong with it.  Mr

Jek's  money was paid into the Party, and so was  this

gentleman's money paid into the Party, and  they  were

both  paid  out of the Party. And so is my money  paid

into  the  Party and paid out to me every month,  less

than  what I receive from the Government. That is  how

we  run  our  Party. I do not want to be  mischievous,

Sir,  because  I think the past should  be  forgotten,

particularly  by those whose past cannot bear  looking

into. The Member for Tanglin suggests a Commission  of

Inquiry. I think he did not consult some of his chaps.

I  could have a Commission and reopen the whole of the

Chew  Swee Kee case, although he has run away to  Ipoh

and  will not come back here. But I could do a lot  of

unpleasant things to the chaps. We are a clean  Party.

We  will  stay that way. We receive nothing  from  the

Americans. We receive nothing illegal and improper. We

do  not even appoint people when we have the power  to

do that.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really suggested that we are misusing our power

of  patronage  just to fill up the party coffers?  For

what?  To  ruin the reputation of our Party? Half  the

strength  of  the Party lies in the fact  that  people

know it is an honest Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



One  may  or may not agree with the Party, but  nobody

believes  that we are hanging on - I for $3,000  and  my

colleagues for $2,500. Surely we are made of a  little

bit of sterner stuff than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I ask the Member for Cairnhill not to be

carried  away  by this. I do not want to  hurt  people

unnecessarily.  I heard an allegation against  a  very

good  friend of mine, Mr Lim Kim San, and I  defended

him with heat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Political Secretary went through a lot with

me. I would trust him implicitly. On 20th July, whilst

the  Member  for  Farrer Park  thought  we  were  just

enacting a little bit of party politics here, we  were

literally  going through life and death,  because  had

they  undermined and convinced others that  they  were

going  to  win  and stampeded others, a  very  serious

position would have arisen. He played a very important

role in stabilising it. I say, I will stand by him any

time, any place, as a gentleman of some character  and

some  worth.  He went to prison for his  beliefs.  The

former Chief Minister put him there. He came out,  and

he  told the former Chief Minister that he was joining

the  P.A.P. and not joining the Labour Front.  And  I

say, credit to the Chief Minister for letting him  out

knowing that he was joining the P.A.P. He went through

with  us  and  we  will stand by him. The  Member  for

Serangoon  Gardens knows the quality of Mr Jek  Yuen

Thong  and very wisely says very little. I advise  him

to  say  very  little on this because I  do  not  want

unnecessarily  to praise Mr Jek Yuen Thong's  virtues

vis-a-vis  the  Member for Upper Serangoon  but  I  am

quite prepared to wade in.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the fact that the money that

was   to  have  been  paid  to  the  acting  Political

Secretary was paid into the coffers of the P.A.P. was

disclosed  by the Prime Minister. I did not  make  any

allegation, but I do say that it was not right to this

extent.  The  Political Secretary  went  on  leave  to

contest  the by-election. His post could not  be  left

for  a  month.  It had to be filled by the  editor  of

their own Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>



organ.  His salary was taken into the Party,  and  the

Party paid him what his salary was as an editor.  That

was  what  the Prime Minister said. But in  his  five-minute  speech  just  now, he  did  not  make  another

attempt to explain away the increase of $250.  It  was

not  normal, because if it was normal, then the salary

of  the Publicity Liaison Secretary in the Ministry of

Culture fixed at $1,400 is therefore not correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir,It

was  an  oversight. The reason why the $1,400 was  not

increased is that that post was never filled. There is

no holder of that post since it was left vacant. May I

say  this? These are all patronage positions. We could

make  more - and  we have more - in statutory  boards  and

various  other  bodies. If patronage is  how  a  Party

enriches  itself, we could do it easily. The post  has

not been filled because there has been no man suitable

for  it.  The men who fill these jobs have to  satisfy

our  needs  first. The only reason why the  salary  of

that post has not been increased, like the others,  is

that the post is still vacant. So when the restoration

of the allowances took place, that post was vacant and

it never took effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has

said  that  if  they  wanted to give  these  posts  of

patronage  because  of what they  have  done  for  the

Party,  they  would have filled the other  posts.  The

truth of the matter is this. I think this is what took

place.  There  were a number of persons on  the  scene

whom they wanted to appoint to these posts. There were

five  or  six  of  them to whom they  wanted  to  give

appointments.  Now they wanted to put these  into  the

Budget  under the various Ministries. So they  had  to

build  up  a  facade - the word was used  by  the  Prime

Minister  himself - that everything was  all  right,  so

that  if  they  made  only  six  appointments  in  six

Ministries, the question would be asked, "Why  do  you

not  do it for all the Ministries?" To put up a facade

before this Assembly, they put all these posts in  all

the  Ministries. I am convinced that I am  correct  in

this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, Sir. There has been a Political Secretary

to the Ministry of Home Affairs ever since the concept

of  a Political Secretary was brought into this House.

But  that post has never been filled and it will never

be filled. If I remember rightly, there was no post of

Political Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister,  was

there?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Oh, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It was only recently created. Was it

created  at  the  same time with  the  rest  on  their

initial creation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In any case, that post was also never

filled  until  Mr  Fong Swee Suan had  to  leave  the

Minister. He was then transferred to the Deputy  Prime

Minister.  Now  if  there had been no  differences  of

opinion  between Mr Fong Swee Suan and the Government

on  matters  of policy then the Deputy Prime  Minister

would  have always been without a Political Secretary.

So, Mr Speaker, Sir, let us not put something across.

Let  us  not really try and bluff the whole time.  The

Prime  Minister  has  succeeded in  bluffing  his  way

through up till now. Let him not try and bluff all the

time.  You  can bluff some of the people some  of  the

time  but not all the time. If he thinks it is a  fair

statement   to  say  that  he  wants  these  Political

Secretaries to help the Party, I accept it. But do not

try  to  pull the wool over our eyes all the time.  My

quarrel with all these appointments now, Sir, is this.

Purely  from the budgetary point of view - and  I  think

the   Minister  for  Finance  should  take  an  active

interest  in  this - the intention of the Government  is

not to fill any of these posts now. Why should they be

carried  in  the Budget? The Minister for  Finance  is

very  particular about appointments. He always queries

the  departments, "Do you want this post?" If they  do

want  the  post  and it has not been  filled  for  two

years,  a query goes out. It is a normal query in  any

financial  department,  "These  posts  have  not  been

filled for two years. Why do you want them now?"  That

is  the  normal query for the Minister for Finance  to

put up. Has he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



done  it?  No.  Why  not? Because it  is  a  political

appointment,  and  the facade must  be  carried  right

through to the bitter end?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Maybe I can help the House as to

why   there  was  an  increase  in  this  salary.  The

Government know that they are only 26. Time is running

short. The writing is on the wall, and they are on the

way out. This is legal looting because -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I will not allow the expression

"legal  looting"  in  this House. That  is  completely

unparliamentary  if  it is said  of  Members  of  this

House - and it is said of Members of this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw that phrase. Anyway,

the  increase  in  salary will help  to  maintain  the

coffers  of the P.A.P. because it can be easily  found

out how much these Political Secretaries receive. That

will  tell  us exactly what is happening to Government

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, one logical point which the

Member for Farrer Park has not been able to answer  is

this.  If we wanted to loot, why did we bother to  put

nine  posts in the Budget? A dishonest government  can

loot  so quietly and effectively that the country will

be plundered. Let us be honest about these things. The

powers  vested  in  the  Ministers  now  by  the   new

Constitution  and the integration of the City  Council

into Government are those of the former Government - the

Chief   Secretary   and  the  Mayor.   The   Ministers

collectively exercise now all the powers of  patronage

of the Governor, the Mayor and the Chief Secretary. We

can  stash away a lot of things without having  to  go

through this Budget. I have made this point before and

I  think  the  Member for Farrer  Park  has  tried  to

exercise his mind to find out the reason. He  says  it

is  a facade. That is not true. I will tell him why we

put  in  nine posts. To begin with, I had  to  have  a

Political  Secretary and I had made up my mind  before

the  elections  that Mr Jek was to  be  my  Political

Secretary. I have been with him for a long time,  Sir,

and I trust him. He is an extremely able man. He could

have been in this Assembly because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



he  could have taken any seat and  people  knew

that  the P.A.P. was going to win. But he did not want

a  seat. He went out to Hong Lim to fight when he knew

it was a tough fight and lost. He was prepared for it.

I  could  give  hint patronage in a thousand  and  one

different ways. If that is what is required.  I  could

appoint him to so many boards and stash away money for

him.  But  we openly put it through this vote  in  the

Assembly because he has to be my open political  aide.

Similarly. Inche Rahim Ishak helping the Minister  for

Culture.  As for the others, let me explain  what  the

position  was  in  June  1959.  If  the  former  Chief

Minister, the Member for Cairnhill, had read his files

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I do not know whether complete files were sent to him

as   Chief  Minister,  but  I  am  quite  sure  fairly

reasonable  summaries must have been sent to  him  - he

knew the position. He knew the distinction between Mr

Fong  Swee  Suan's and Mr Lim Ching Siong's position.

That  Mr Fong Swee Suan was no longer a Communist  in

June  l959  but that Mr Lim Ching Siong was  still  a

Communist supporter. He knew that Mr Woodhull and Mr

Devan  Nair  were not Communists. That Mr Devan  Nair

had  broken  with the Party and that Mr Woodhull  who

was  always  only fellow-travelling was finished  with

the  Communists. That was the position in  June  1959.

The  Member for Cairnhill was the Chief Minister right

up  to 2nd  June. How can he deny it? He knows  that

that is true. Why does he make up all this froth? When

we  appointed them - as I said before and I said it  in

my broadcasts - it was a calculated risk. We knew we had

four  on our side - Devan Nair, Woodhull, Fong Swee Suan

and  James  Puthucheary - and Mr Lim  Ching  Siong  was

against  us.  But he said openly that he  was  on  our

side.  He signed the documents. Privately, we  doubted

his  sincerity. We had to take a chance to see whether

the  four could convince the one. The tragedy  of  the

thing is that the one convinced the three and only one

had  enough guts to fight through - win or lose - for  his

beliefs.  I say this for the two Political Secretaries

who went through with us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



If  they were just time-servers, they would have  gone

over  to  the  other  side. But they  were  not.  They

decided  to dig their toes in, stand up for what  they

believed  in,  and fight with us - win or lose.  It  now

happens  that the Barisan Sosialis are going to  lose,

but  that  is another matter. They thought  they  were

going to win.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You hope!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I know, not I hope. I know. I

looked up this horoscope man and he read the stars. He

looked  most carefully at the red star of the  Barisan

Sosialis, and the blue circle suddenly crushed the red

star.  It splintered to smithereens. The question  is,

have  those  various parts of the red star enough  red

corpuscles to go through with it to the bitter end, as

we have?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You will see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, we will see. I do not know,

but  my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, told

me  that just before the purge in 1957 the Member  for

Havelock disappeared upcountry. Very useful! But  this

time  disappearing upcountry will not help because  it

is  Pan-Malayan. Even going to Borneo may not help. It

is  Pan-Malaysian.  The same police  force,  the  same

security outfit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Do not intimidate!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> These are calculations which I

made for them. I counted it slowly on the fingers of

two hands and I said to them -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Four hands.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Four hands? Maybe he was doing

some counting as well.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know whether the hon.

Members  on  the  Opposition  side  realise  that   by

interjecting they are losing time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I was going to ask you, Sir, when the

Prime Minister was going back to the point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In this particular case, I do not think

we  can  blame  the Prime Minister for wandering  away

because  of  the  interjections.  If  there  were   no

interjections, then of course I would be justified  in

calling him to order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We had already made up our minds.

We  took  a calculated risk. We appointed six  because

there were six valuable aides. We knew there were five

valuable aides. One we knew was a risk, but we had  to

carry that risk because -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. And that risk was given to

the stoutest-hearted of all my colleagues to carry. He

knew  he  was  carrying  it and  he  gave  the  person

concerned  a  lot  of statistics to  read  every  day,

hoping   thereby  that  he  would  become   scholarly.

Unfortunately,   that   was   not   the   case,   Sir.

[Interruption].



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it would not be about the air-conditioning. I

think it was about some other matter. But whatever  it

was,  the  Member for Cairnhill knew the position.  He

was  in authority. He was fully informed, and he  knew

the  position. It is no use saying he did not know the

position.  I  do not want to disclose my  conversation

with  the Member for Geylang Serai - he is a very well

informed person on these matters. In fact, one week he

gave  them a curry lunch before they were put away  in

Changi camp.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I must ask the Prime

Minister now to come back and wind up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to to make is this.

We  had  decided to appoint five because we  had  five

available men. We had whistled up all because  we  did

not  know where to transfer them. And as and when  men

were available, we would appoint them. But they had to

be  worth their salt. In the end we lost three back to

them.  Well, it cannot be helped. Perhaps that is  our

bad   luck.  But  the  battle  is  a  continuing   and

continuous one. There will be other rounds. I  have  a

feeling  that  those who start changing sides  two  or

three times



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



will   become   finally  battered   and   smashed   to

smithereens. One force comes in and captures. The next

force comes in and captures. Three or four times,  and

the place is ruined.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us come back to the

particular motion. Has the Prime Minister completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, I just want to wind up. The

point  is  that four vacancies have been created.  One

person   resigned  for  political  reasons.   I   have

explained  this. He did not want to be  a  hostage  to

fortune. One was - anyway we knew it - against us. Two had

political amnesia and went over to the other side. One

of  them, I think, is already sorry because he told me

to buy a glass of beer for old time's sake, and I did,

in the C.P.A. Room, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That took about three seconds! I take

it that a vote is required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (7) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the note against this item in page

71  of this Estimates, the post is "Regarded". I would

like  to  submit that this is not, in actual  fact,  a

regarding but rather an upgrading. The post  has  been

upgraded   from   Secretary  to  Principal   Assistant

Secretary.  Hence  as a result of that  upgrading,  an

annual increase of $5,130 takes place, that is to say,

about $430 a month. The post of Secretary carries with

it  a salary code of I-II, which is a salary scale  of

$680 by stages up to a maximum of $1,420. Whereas  the

salary code for Principal Assistant Secretary is given

as l-7, which carries with it a salary scale of $1,300-40A-1,420. That is to say, although the maximum of the

scale  the  same, yet the difference  in  the  initial

entry  is $620. I would ask the Minister, Sir, whether

it would not be more correct to call it upgrading than

regarding.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir, if

the man gets more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



money,  the Member for Cairnhill is correct in  saying

that  it  is  upgraded. But what  it  actually  is  is

this - supposing  we say upgraded. May I  explain,  Sir,

that  this  particular change is not confined  to  the

Prime  Minister's Office? There was carried out  early

this  year  a  general  regarding  of  posts  in   the

administrative  service. This is an  exercise  carried

out  after  a  detailed  study  by  officials  of  the

Treasury  and  the  Organisation and  Methods  Branch.

There  was a general feeling that the former hierarchy

of posts was a bit top-heavy. It was inadequate in the

sense   that   certain   posts  which   carried   more

responsibility   than  others  were   not   adequately

regarded  and vice versa. So a Committee of  officials

of the Treasury and Organisation and Methods went into

the  details of all the posts in the Establishment and

Administrative service, and made their recommendations

which  were  considered valid objectives and  accepted

with some amendments. It would say this is an exercise

to rationalise the administration.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Does this mean that the holder of

the   post  of  Secretary  automatically  becomes  the

Principal  Assistant Secretary?  He  has  to  make  it

clear.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, that is by no means the case.

Some  posts  were downgraded and others  upgraded.  In

general.  I  think  there was  more  downgrading  than

upgrading to get the proper balance in the hierarchy.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Since this post was upgraded, will

the  normal  civil service procedure be  observed - that

there   will   be  advertisements  and   perhaps   the

appointments  will  go through  the  P.S.C.?  And  the

Secretary,  of  course, will have a  better  claim  of

being promoted.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

mentioned  before,  this  is purely  a  civil  service

Establishment  and Organisation and Methods  exercise,

and all the formalities are being rigidly adhered to.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With the explanation given, Sir,

may I withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 he reduced by

$10 in respect of item (8) of subhead 1.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment stood in the name of Inche Mohamed Ali bin Alwi.

<hr size="2" noshade>



Here  there is the question of one regarding, but I  am

not  going  to question that because of the explanation

given  by  the Minister for Finance in regard  to  item (7).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do want to ask whether it is really necessary

for  the Prime Minister to have so many Secretaries and

then  to  have  another  post of  Assistant  Secretary,

making  in all three Assistant Secretaries.  Is  it  so

vitally necessary?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at this page, one sees "Parliamentary

Secretary",     "Personal    Secretary    (Political)",

"Permanent  Secretary", "Deputy Secretary",  "Principal

Assistant  Secretary", and now he wants  another  post,

"Assistant  Secretary".  Is it  necessary  for  another

Assistant  Secretary  to help  the  Prime  Minister  in

carrying  out  his work, which would be  much  lessened

when merger takes place, as the Government thinks would

take place by June 1963?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I wish my duties were less

and   decreasing.  But,  unfortunately,  they   neither

increase nor decrease in this particular case.  In  the

case  of  the two Assistant Secretaries, one is  in  an

acting  capacity as my Secretary, and the other is  the

Secretary for External Affairs. The increase is  really

an  Establishment  transfer - I  do  not  know  what  the

correct word is - but the Chairman of the Rural Board has

now  been upgraded into the Administrative service, and

the holder will now appear as "Assistant Secretary". So

far  as staff are concerned, they are exactly the same.

It  is  just  that this post has been  upgraded  to  an

administrative post.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> According to the note appearing

against  this item, it says "One new post." So it  must

be a new post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The post is created, but the man

is already there doing the job. He is one of the Malay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



officers  who  was upgraded from the Executive  service

into  the Administrative service. The officer concerned

was  acting as Chairman of the Rural Board, and he  was

upgraded  into the Administrative service. He continued

to  do  the job, and instead of just drawing an  acting

allowance,  he  now  gets  a  substantive   salary   as

Assistant Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do I understand the Hon. the Prime

Minister to say that the post of Chairman, Rural Board,

has lapsed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. The officer concerned was

doing  the job but he was not satisfied with the scale.

The  post  does not lapse, Sir. What happened was  that

the  man - I  think  he was in the Executive  service - was

doing  the  work of Chairman of the Rural Board  in  an

acting  capacity. The Rural Board was transferred  from

the  Ministry  of National Development to my  Ministry,

and the man was promoted from the Executive Service  to

the Administrative Service. Therefore, one more post of

Assistant Secretary has been created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (14) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (14) is in respect of stenographers. According

to last year's Estimates, there were two stenographers.

But  now,  this year's Estimates show "4".  This  means

that  there has 'been an increase during the course  of

1961,  and  what is asked for is another  increase - from

two  stenographers  in 1961, the Prime  Minister  wants

four  for  1962.  I  hope the additional  stenographers

wanted by the Prime Minister are not meant to take down

his series of awful disclosures because that would be a

waste of public funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The one new stenographer is now

Personal  Assistant to my Parliamentary  Secretary.  In

fact, the post was created when my former Parliamentary

Secretary, the Member for Upper Serangoon, asked for  a

P.A.

(Personal  Assistant)  to help him  in  his  duties  of

filing and attending to his correspondence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other stenographer has been taken over from the

City  Council. I have only two stenographers, Sir. They

are both hard-working and I hope one of them will get a

promotion  for  having helped me.  Going  up  to  Kuala

Lumpur and coming down, he worked very hard. He  did  a

lot  of  typing in Kuala Lumpur, in the aeroplane,  and

getting  the  White  Paper  ready  in  time  for   this

Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the jibe about the twelve broadcasts, may I

just  make a passing reference? I thank the Member  for

Cairnhill for admitting that I write my own broadcasts.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I withdraw, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (20) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (20) is in respect of chauffeurs. Last year

there  was  a  question about the number of  chauffeurs

attached to the Prime Minister's Office. At that  time,

there were five chauffeurs. Now there is a request  for

an increase of one chauffeur. But I cannot see anywhere

in  these Estimates an increase in the number of  cars,

although  later on there is a vote asking for  two  new

cars  to  be bought for replacement. There is no  extra

car. Why should there be an extra chauffeur?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have to repeat my explanation

last year. There are six cars. As I explained last year

to  the Member for Farrer Park, what happened was  that

one  was  a  City Council driver who used to drive  the

Mayor's car. I explained to the Member for Farrer  Park

that  the salary of this City Council driver was higher

than  that of the Government syces and there  was  some

difficulty about absorbing him as a chauffeur.  He  has

now  gone back to the City Council and is retaining his

old  salary.  We have recruited a new one to  take  his

place.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I withdraw, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (22) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Prime Minister to explain this

allowance to the Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the men to explain this

really  are  the  first Chief Minister and  the  second

Chief   Minister.  They  had  the  Secretaries.   Their

Secretaries drew an allowance of $200 for the honour of

doing  the extra duty of becoming the Secretary to  the

Prime Minister or the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I explain to the Prime

Minister,  Sir, that during the time of the  two  Chief

Ministers, there was a Secretary? According to the vote

now, there is no longer a Secretary. So to whom is  the

vote  to  be  paid?  The  post of  Secretary  has  been

upgraded to that of Principal Assistant Secretary, on a

higher salary scale. Therefore, according to this vote,

if  it  is  an allowance to the Secretary to the  Prime

Minister,  there is no post of Secretary in  the  Prime

Minister's Office any more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the position is quite

simple. A timescale officer fills this job. If he fills

this  job,  he gets an allowance of $200. That  is  all

there is to it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of his very important

duty,  the  post of Secretary has now been upgraded  to

Principal  Assistant  Secretary, carrying  with  it  an

increase of more than $300.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is part of the Establishment

upgrading  that the Minister for Finance has explained.

It  has  nothing  to  do  with my  giving  anybody  any

promotion, it  is  part  of  the  whole  Establishment

machinery.  I  was not consulted. I know nothing  about

it.  These  are part of the esoteric movements  of  the

Civil  Service.  From time to time, a commission  or  a

committee goes round and upgrades or downgrades a post.

So it has been going on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if this vote is passed, there

is  no  Secretary  in  the Prime Minister's  Office  to

receive this vote. If he wants that money to go to  the

Principal  Assistant Secretary, may I  suggest  that  a

correction  be  made that this is an allowance  to  the

Principal Assistant Secretary and not to the Secretary,

when there is no longer any more Secretary in the Prime

Minister's Office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If the Member for Cairnhill is

right  and  my Secretary allows this to pass,  then  it

will serve him right if he does not receive the money.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I hope the Secretary will

receive this allowance. But I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg

to move,



That  the sum to he allocated for Head 7 he reduced  by

$10 in respect of item (23) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask, to whom is this allowance given and for

what purpose?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The sum set out there is

expatriation  pay for two expatriate jobs.  One  is  my

Deputy  Secretary, Mr Meadows, and the  other  is  the

Chief  Planner  attached to the post of  Chief  Planner

which  is now being filled in an acting capacity  by  a

local  man.  Each of them draws $250 per month.  Whilst

the  post of Chief Planner is held by a local man,  the

expatriation allowance is not paid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I ask, when

will  this  allowance be abolished? Does it mean  there

are  no capable people to fill these posts now held  by

these expatriate officers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is not the question of not

enough  people with talent. There are not enough trained

people  with talent. That is the trouble. We have  some

talented people running around. We tried to train them.

But they came unstuck and they are still running around

with  a  lot  of  talent going to waste.  What  we  are

interested   in,  as  far  as  the  civil  service   is

concerned,   is  tamed  administrative  and   technical

talent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have defended Mr Meadows against the Member for

Hong  Lim. I will defend him against anybody. He  is  a

useful digit in the civil service. He gets things done.

If  I  did  not  have Mr Meadows, perhaps  the  refuse

outside  the house of the Member for Serangoon  Gardens

might  not  have been collected during the  strike.  He

arranged a temporary scheme to look after these matters

so  that health and sanitation services could go on for

the  benefit  of people like the Member  for  Serangoon

Gardens. That is all. He is a very useful man. $250,  I

think, is a very reasonable sum. If we do not want him,

he  will go. But I want him because he is a very useful

man, incidentally  the Member for Queenstown  and  the

Member  for Nee Soon know that Mr Meadows never  wrote

my speeches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Does the Prime Minister mean that

there  is  no  other  person who  can  do  the  job  of

directing refuse to be collected?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I never said that. There are some

valuable local civil servants to do it. There  are  not

enough  of them. There is Mr Woon Wah Siang who  gives

valuable  help  in the administrative side.  There  are

several  other able men who helped to settle the  White

Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961. But there are unfortunately  not

enough  of  them.  People who know  this  best  of  all

defended  this. The Member for Nee Soon and the  Member

for   Queenstown  defended  this  against  the   absurd

suggestions  of the Member for Hong Lim. But  now  they

want  to join him. How mad can we all become, Sir! They

were  defending and explaining to the Assemblymen.  The

Member  for  Nee  Soon  was the  Secretary.  We  always

appointed him Secretary. He was a useful man.  He  kept

notes  studiously  and  was good  at  explanations.  He

explained to all Assemblymen, including the Member  for

Queenstown, how important it was not to start monkeying

around  with  the  technical  expatriates  and  so  on,

otherwise  the  sewers may come up the  wrong  way.  He

remembers  that. It is all entered in the minute  book.

Unfortunately, the minute book is now missing, although

it is the property of the P.A.P.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

explanation of the Prime Minister, I beg leave to

withdraw this amendment. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Prime Minister must realise that I

have  to  wait to get the interpretation.  Perhaps  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a vote for expense in connection with

visits  of distinguished visitors. For 1961,  the  vote

asked  for  was  $1,000. For 1962,  what  is  asked  is

$4,000. It is four times as much. I would like  to  ask

the  Prime  Minister why there should be this four-fold

increase.  What  kind  of  and how  many  distinguished

visitors   are   expected  to  visit  an  extinguishing

government? [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not intend to congratulate

the  Member for Cairnhill, Sir. I was brought up  in  a

school  where we expect finesse in wit. We  must  thank

the  Airport  for  its efficiency in bringing  about  a

situation where, from time to time, we are honoured  by

more  V.I.P.s  who  stay here for two  or  three  days.

Whether  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  extinguished   or

whether  it is distinguished, there will be people  who

will  come to Singapore because this is one of the most

important  halting  places in  the  Far  East.  And  it

behoves   a   courteous   government   to   offer   the

hospitality.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, since the Prime Minister did

not  challenge  the fact that the P.A.P. Government  is

extinguishing, may I beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Prime Minister does not give in?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I never -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> By default!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I never lose by default. It is

one  of those things which I learned very early in this

little  game  with  the former Chief Minister - deny  him

seriatim and deny him specifically whenever he mentions

it again. So by implication all that is not admitted is

denied. And if he still raises it, I deny it absolutely

and   specifically.  I  will  say  this.  If   in   the

unfortunate event the P.A.P. is extinguished and if  he

reads Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, he will see that

lots of other things are also extinguished with it.  So

it is in his interest to see that the Barisan star does

not burn up Singapore. And the people who will see that

the  Barisan  star  does not burn up Singapore  is  the

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is too late. The hon. Member asked

for  leave  to  withdraw,  but  he  excited  the  Prime

Minister  into  making a short speech.  Therefore,  the

request  for leave to withdraw is not granted.  A  vote

must  be  taken.  That is how Opposition  Members  lose

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (11)* has been dealt with. Amendment (12).

<hr size="2" noshade>

*Amendment (11), standing in the names of Mr A. P. Rajah, Tun Lim Yew Hock, Inche Mohamed Ali bin Alwi and Inche Ahmad Jabri bin Mohammad Akib, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 7.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 19.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two cars for replacement. For 1961, i.e., for this

year, there was a vote for two cars for replacement. It

seems  that  in  1962  there  are  two  more  cars  for

replacement.  But for this replacement, the  sum  asked

for  is $47,030, which is almost double the cost of the

car which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



is  asked for for 1962 for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

I do not wish to suggest, Sir, that the Prime Minister

is  doing  himself quite well as against the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not want to waste the time

of  the House, but if the Member for Cairnhill goes on

in  this way, then he brings this about. I will rattle

off  the mileage. The Humber Pullman S1 has in  its  9

years done 120,000 miles. The Humber Pullman S2, which

used  to be the Mayor's car (S7 changed to S5000)  has

done  150,000 miles. There is, of course, SB  1,  Sir,

but  that  has not done 150,000 miles and is  in  very

good  condition  compared to S1 and  S2.  We  want  to

dispose  of these two cars for the simple reason  that

although  they  look handsome - they are enormous  cars - they cost a tremendous amount to run. I am told it  is

somewhere   around  9  miles  per   gallon   and   the

maintenance  is  getting heavier and heavier,  because

the  parts  are more and more difficult to get.  These

two  cars  are to replace S1 and S2. May I  say,  Sir,

that  I do not use all these cars? I use only one car.

These  are all pool cars and are drawn on by Ministers

when they have formal functions. [Interruption] I  beg

your pardon?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> An interjection, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well, I am not worried about

interjections, please, Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I have said, they are all pool

cars, used by V.I.P.s and Ministers who have to attend

functions and so on. The sum asked for is, in fact, to

buy one medium-sized car like the Rover which is being

bought for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I would like to

mention   this,   that  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara

inherited  a  Rolls Royce, and the Prime Minister  was

not  as  fortunate  as  that. He  inherited  a  Humber

Pullman, a very modest one.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Air conditioned and all that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I air conditioned my own

private  car. I might inform the Member for  Nee  Soon

that  it helps in clear thinking. One keeps cooler  at

traffic   lights;  a  few  more  moments   for   quiet

contemplation; and more accurate decisions  are  made.

In  the long run, it is a very suitable investment.  I

would  advise him that perhaps if he had  invested  in

these things, instead of running around in the heat of

the  day carting Organising Secretaries who are trying

to  loot Branches of the P.A.P., he might have been in

a happier position today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In some people's cars.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Even the Government benches are

trying to lose time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Whatever it is, may I say there

are  two  different things - the man in his  individual

capacity  and the man in his official capacity?  There

are  occasions when you just cannot arrive by taxi and

you cannot even arrive by your own car, because it  is

not   called   for.   There  are  certain   ceremonial

occasions,  and somebody has to drive you  up  to  the

front  door because everybody drives up to  the  front

door  and a little bit of ceremony is necessary. I  am

quite  sure  the Member for Nee Soon somewhat  regrets

the fact that he has opted out of these things because

he  used to enjoy riding in these cars with me, and he

was  looking  forward  to the Daimler.  In  fact,  the

adviser   to   his   Party,  Mr  James   Puthucheary,

congratulated me on my quite good taste  in  acquiring

the  Daimler. He is a connoisseur in the arts of life.

He  wanted to take up golf. He wanted the Minister for

Finance to pay far golf and so on. And there you are.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is irrelevant. Mr Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, this is my complaint about the Prime

Minister.  When  he  is in a difficult  situation,  he

always  talks about something else. He has  given  the

House an adequate explanation of why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>



he  wants replacements for two cars, but I think he has

not  answered the further question why he wants $47,000

for two cars. Could he please answer that one?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the estimate is some

$12,000  odd  for  the Rover and  some  $30,000  for  a

Mercedes.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Wah, Mercedes? I beg leave to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 20 is in respect of furnishings for Temasek,

Kuala  Lumpur.  May  I  ask the  Prime  Minister  where

Temasek is? How many rooms there are, and how often  it

is  used that an expenditure of $30,000 is necessary to

furnish the place?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I thought Temasek was in Changi,

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir. It is Temasek, Kuala

Lumpur. The House is in Kuala Lumpur and my only regret

is   that   it  is  not  yet  ready  for  our  visiting

Assemblymen and the other V.I.P.s in Kuala  Lumpur  who

from  time  to time honour us. The house, which  is  in

Circular  Road, is in a state of disrepair. It  has,  I

think,  four  bedrooms. Perhaps when it  is  fully  and

nicely  done  and  decorated, we  might  put  it  on  a

Christmas  card and send it to the Member for Cairnhill

next year. It will not be ready before Christmas, so it

will  have  to  be next year. I would like  to  mention

this.  Sir, we sent up some officials who drew  up  the

estimates.  I  was  told it will be a  little  bit  too

modest  because an oil company has a better house  next

door.  But nevertheless, as an indication of  a  frugal

and  thrifty Government, there is Temasek which I  hope

will  be  reasonably furnished and the decor should  be

suitable in order that we shall keep the flag flying in

Kuala Lumpur. The State flag should fly quite often  in

Kuala  Lumpur because from time to time there  will  be

meetings  there and I hope we shall have the honour  of

entertaining all those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>



are successful in turning up there because they are

wanted by the people to represent Singapore in

Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The 15 Members can use it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not necessarily, Sir. All 15 will

not be able to use it. We might have some difficulty in

getting  15 into it. It is not a hostel. Of course,  if

the  Member for Cairnhill or the Member for Farrer Park

wants  to suggest a vote to the Finance Minister for  a

hostel, we will think about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> We do not want hostels.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Prime Minister

has  not  even answered my question. He has  only  said

there  are  four rooms. I ask, what are the furnishings

for?  He  just  tells me there are four rooms.  I  know

nothing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not know the

furnishings. It is all left to the P.W.D. It goes to  a

Tenders  Board.  Somebody buys chairs and  cutlery  and

hangs up pictures, and I do not know what else. We hope

at  the  end  of it all you will go into  a  reasonable

house and get a reasonable dinner. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I take it the Hon. the Minister for

Finance has his eagle eye on this vote. If he will only

assure  the House that nothing out of the way  will  be

allowed, we will be satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the trouble is

that  national prestige comes into play. Much as I like

to  see  economy exercised in this particular  item,  I

think one can go too far.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, perhaps the Prime Minister will also

have difficulty in explaining. Can he tell me what  the

$5,000  vote  asked for is, for what kind of  furniture

and  equipment for the State Guest House; and how often

it has been used?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I must confess I have

not  gone  into the details of the $5,000,  and  I

make  very  little apology for it,  because  if  I

start  bothering  myself with  what  furniture  is

being  moved  about  or changed,  or  repaired  or

replaced,  or what carpet or curtains have  to  be

done, I think very little time will be left to  me

to  attend  to  the  other  somewhat  more  urgent

matters  of  my  Ministry. All I  can  assure  the

Member for Cairnhill is that this is a State Guest

House  and  it has to be maintained up to  certain

standards.  All  Ministers do their  entertainment

there. Members from the Barisan Sosialis who  have

no vested interest in it now can bear witness that

when  we  entertain, Sir, we do it hospitably  and

well, and we hope that we shall always be able  to

maintain reasonable standards of hospitality.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister says

he  does not waste his time in trying to find  out

the  number  of chairs and what not. I would  also

therefore ask him not to waste his time in  trying

to  find out that Members of the Opposition travel

in  small cars carrying 17 passengers. That  would

also  be  a waste of time. I would like the  Prime

Minister  to  say, if he can, how many  times  the

State Guest House is to be used a year. He has not

said that.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you, Sir. I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be

reduced  by  $10  in respect  of  item  (10)  of

subhead 23.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will touch on item (14) at the same time.

Sir,  it  seems that there is a very high increase

in  the  rents proposed. But on item (14), Sir,  a

vote  is  asked  for "Purchase of Houses  for  the

Senior   Trade  and  Cultural  Representative   to

Indonesia   No amount is given, just a token  vote

of  $10. Surely, Sir, the Minister knows how  many

houses  are to be bought and what types of  houses

they are. I am sure he must know the size and  the

number  of  rooms,  otherwise he  could  not  have

agreed to a vote of $3,300 in the next item, which

is   item   (15),   for  repairs,  re-decorations,

alterations and electrical installation.  He  must

know  the  number of houses and the  size  of  the

houses.  But  there is another point  on  which  I

would  like  to talk, particularly on  item  (14).

Sir,  external  relations are to be  left  in  the

hands  of the Central Government when merger takes

place.  The  Central Government has an Embassy  in

Indonesia.  Is it necessary now for  Singapore  to

incur  this expenditure of buying houses  for  the

Senior  Trade  and  Cultural  Representative?  The

representation will be taken away from us. We will

be  represented by the Central Government. I would like  to

know, Sir, in respect of item (10),  why this sudden increase in

rents of $15,000 a year?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to

be  allocated  for  Head 7 be reduced  by  $10  in

respect of item (10) of subhead 23", the debate to

range  over  amendment (16), although I  have  not

seen the connection yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, this increase of rents

is a very embarrassing explanation. I am told that

in Djakarta rents and the cost of living are quite

variable,  and from time to time we have  to  make

adjustments  as to what we send our representative

there.  The explanation I have received  from  the

officials in charge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Djakarta Office is that the rents  have  just

gone up and nothing can be done about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On item (14) I think Members might be interested to

know  it  is  only  a  three-room  flat.  It  is  most

unfortunate  that  we have not been  able  to  find  a

suitable house yet. Hence, only a token vote  of  $10.

But there must be a vote in order to justify action to

purchase  a  house  immediately a suitable  one  comes

along.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point has been appropriately made by the Member

for  Cairnhill that after merger the office  of  Trade

Representative  will merge with  the  Embassy  of  the

Central  Government in Djakarta. But if  you  look  at

Cmd.  33  of 1961, paragraph 5, on trade and  cultural

representation, you will see that provision  has  been

made for the Singapore State Government to incorporate

its  trade representation in important places as  part

of    the   Malayan   Embassy.   Whilst   the    Trade

Representative  there will no longer  be  representing

Singapore  as such and he becomes part of the  Malayan

delegation,  his duties will be just  simply  to  look

after  the trade side of Singapore. He will  still  be

there  and he will still require a house. But this  is

one  of  the  votes which will appear in  the  Central

Government's Budget as from merger.

Could  we  have some explanation as to what  all  this

means?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Shortly after our coming into

office,  it was found necessary to get a Committee  to

consider the question of local State honours,  because

from time to time those who serve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



the  State  either  voluntarily or in  their  official

capacity  as  civil  servants  will  have  to  receive

recognition for their services. The Committee has been

some time in drafting the rules and conditions for the

award of honours, and some further time has been spent

in   getting   the  necessary  medals  and  medallions

designed  and ordered. This is to enable the  Treasury

to put an order for the first batch. When it is ready,

we  will  formally move a motion in this  Assembly  to

incorporate  all  these  honours  as  State   honours.

Speaking from memory, there are now about six  classes

of  State  honours. I think the House  will  want  the

State  from  time  to  time  to  give  recognition  to

outstanding  service either in a voluntary  or  in  an

official capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Prime Minister, Sir, to answer this:

who  is  the present Trade Commissioner in the  United

Kingdom,  and what salary and allowances are  paid  to

him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Trade Commissioner in

London is a former financial officer here. He draws  a

salary of $8,570 per annum. The increase asked for  is

because  one  new post of Clerical Officer  (Accounts)

has been created.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, this subject was brought up by

me  last year and it was thought at that time  that  a

suitable  local man could be found to fill  this  post

permanently. It would appear that a man who has  drawn

his Malayanisation compensation has been given the job

in London for a long time now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, no suitable appointee has

been available. In fact, if there is one, the man will

be  retained. In all probability, he will be  retained

because he will be required, as the financial officer,

to  make readjustments in the payment of pensions  and

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



transactions  with  regard  to  former  expatriate

officers   to   whom  we  owe  certain   financial

obligations.   Because  the   Crown   Agents   had

increased their charges, we decided that we  would

henceforth  handle  the  payment  of   all   these

financial obligations ourselves. So this work  has

been   transferred  to  the  Trade  Commissioner's

Office  and  the  savings made thereby  more  than

offset this officer's salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add also that after merger, the Office

will    become   part   of   the   Malayan    High

Commissioner's  Office in London. But  here  again

there   will  be  a  special  trade  section   for

Singapore   to   look  after   the   interest   of

Singapore's entrepot matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an item for rent for 1962 for the Office

of  the  Singapore  Government  Representative  in

Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1961 Estimates, there was a vote of

$250  for office and residential accommodation  in

Kuala  Lumpur.  Has  the  office  and  residential

accommodation been found? In view of the fact that

there  is  now  a  Singapore  House  (Temasek)  in

Circular Road, Kuala Lumpur, I would suggest  that

we  could save a lot of money if part of the house

could  be  turned into an office for the Singapore

Government Representative. This would save  a  lot

of  money  because  the house (Temasek)  in  Kuala

Lumpur will not be used constantly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there are reasons of

prestige, apart from reasons of convenience, which

require the office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



to be in town and not in Circular Road, which is a

residential  area.  May I say that  the  vote  has

become  all  the more necessary now  because  with

merger - and particularly in the first few years of

merger - we  will  have  a  considerable  amount  of

clearance  to do with the Central Government,  and

the  office  will  be for more  than  just  purely

decorative purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a point of information. I know that this vote

was in the 1961 Estimates, hut it entirely escaped  my

attention. I wonder how Lady Housing Visitors come  in

in  the  Land  Office. There used to be  Lady  Housing

Visitors  from  the  Singapore Improvement  Trust  and

their   offices  were  dispensed  with  by  the   then

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there are four Lady Housing

Visitors.  They  are  engaged on  checking  on  census

details and other particulars in respect of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



Crown  reverted  properties. Most of these  properties

are  99-year  leases administered by the Land  Office,

pending  clearance for redevelopment  by  the  Housing

Board



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to control occupation of these

premises  to  ensure that additional families  do  not

enter into occupation without authority and add to the

problem of compensation and rehousing at the time when

the Housing Board requires the use of the premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why women or lady officers are used is

that most of the checking has to be done during office

hours when the menfolk are not at home, and it is more

convenient  to  have women officers to deal  with  the

womenfolk who are at home.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wonder if the Prime Minister could give us a statement

of  Government policy on unauthorised houses on  Crown

land and private land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a lot of misunderstanding leading

to  a  great  deal of suffering among people  who  are

seeking  homes,  because they see unauthorised  houses

standing  undisturbed in certain areas. They therefore

ventured and built



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



unauthorised houses with the result that some of these

houses  were demolished. Sir, some of the unauthorised

houses  on  Crown  land have been standing  there  for

perhaps a decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently some tenants of authorised houses on

Government  land were asked to pay arrears  of  up  to

nearly  a  thousand dollars. In one case, Sir,  a  man

with  a  large  family and earning only about  $120  a

month  was  asked to pay that huge sum.  Naturally  he

felt  desperate as he wanted to respect  the  law.  He

felt that under the circumstances he did not have  the

means to pay the arrears demanded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that something has gone wrong somewhere,

that  those  at the very top are perhaps unaware  that

people who went to the Land Office were told that this

was  based on a Cabinet decision and, therefore, civil

servants  had no right to make an alteration.  Sir,  I

would  like  to know whether the Prime Minister  could

give us a statement and that it be given publicity, so

that  people  do  not make mistakes, and  whether  the

decision  was really a Cabinet decision and  therefore

top officials of the Government service could not make

any adjustment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Sir, to demand arrears for the previous

22  months  seems  to be unreasonable.  Why  were  the

arrears  not  collected  earlier?  In  the  days  when

Singapore   was  still  a  colony,  I  remember   this

happened. I went to see the Commissioner for Lands and

pointed out that if the arrears were not collected for

a  period  of  something like 20 months, then  it  was

partly the fault of the Land Office for allowing these

arrears to accumulate. I am glad to say that he agreed

and  waived practically all the arrears except for the

last few months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not think this is the

time  for  me  to  make  an  authoritative  statement,

speaking off the cuff. All I can assure the Member for

Tanglin  is  that  any  unauthorised  house  found  on

Government land will be smacked down immediately it is

found.  He  knows that we have just had  trouble  with

some 20 unauthorised houses at the junction of Whitley

Road and Mount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



Pleasant  Road,  because  the  officer  concerned  was

dilatory - he  is  under a disciplinary  charge  now - for

there  does  not  seem to be any  obvious  reason  why

action  was  not  taken earlier when a senior  officer

had, in fact, instructed that action be taken. And the

inference is that for some reason or other he  delayed

action in order to allow the building to continue  and

occupation  to  take place, so that  the  position  in

regard to demolition would become more difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking from memory, we considered all cases of

unauthorised  houses on Crown land, and after  careful

consideration decided as from a certain  date - I  think

it was sometime last year - to number and give Temporary

Occupation  Licences to all those  already  built.  As

from  that  date, a warning was issued that any  house

built on Crown land without authority would be smacked

down  immediately. I think the House will recall  that

we  moved an amendment to I cannot remember the  exact

Ordinance.  I  think  it was in conjunction  with  the

Local  Government  Ordinance. It  empowered  the  City

Council  and the local authority to smack down  houses

without  asking for a Court order, and to  smack  them

down  immediately even if they were in the process  of

building.  Since  then  there  has  been  very  little

trouble  except where, for various reasons  which  are

now  under investigation, 20 houses are allowed to  be

put  up in Whitley Road. The senior officer had  given

instructions  that they should be immediately  smacked

down. It was not until families had moved in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think one can minimise the problem of the

housing shortage. One sympathises. As a government, it

is  our duty to provide housing. I think we are  doing

our  very  best,  and we have done  better  than  ever

before.  But I do not think we can expect to catch  up

with  the  backlog of housing for a  very  long  time,

perhaps never. It is an unending process. But that  is

no  excuse for allowing illegal builders to build  and

buyers to move in within a matter of hours of the last

nail going in; in some cases even before the last nail

is driven in. The buyer buys the house knowing that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



is  buying it at a risk. And the risk is: can he  move

in fast enough before the police get to know of it, or

the  land bailiff gets to know of it, and squat  there

with his wife and children, and say, "Well, here I am.

I would rather die then be moved out." Now that is the

risk  he  took. We have shown in Malcolm Road that  if

you  buy a house on that basis, you might lose  a  few

hundred dollars. The builder takes the risk in putting

it  up.  If the buyer does not move in quickly enough,

the builder has lost his money and his labour. He will

take his planks, attap and zinc away. But if he builds

fast  enough before the land bailiff gets to  know  of

it - it  is like a game, Sir, who beats whom in  finding

out.  If  the house is completed before the police  or

the  land  bailiffs  are on the spot,  the  tenant  is

already there and he says, "Move me if you dare,  over

my dead body." And we show in Malcolm Road that if you

know you carry the risk at the time you bought it  and

you  are  trying to beat the Government, so to  speak,

well  then, the law has to be enforced. And  I  cannot

emphasise too strongly the fact that we intend to  see

that  these vacant spaces which are meant for schools,

hospitals,  clinics - it is only a matter  of  time  and

programming before they are built on - are built

on.   They are not vacant for nothing. They are vacant

for  schools, hospitals and other public institutions.

And  if  you  allow buildings on them, the Member  for

Farrer  Park can vouch from his own experience in  the

S.I.T.,  you  may  never get them cleared.  There  are

large  sections  of  open garden,  valuable  property,

which  will  never be built on by the  Housing  Board.

Because it is so heavily and so densely built upon now

by squatters that short of a fire of the dimensions of

Bukit Ho Swee, you will never build on it. So we would

rather  face  20  unpleasant families  who  I  believe

picketed the Assembly on the first day of this Session

before they were moved away. We have just got to  face

this unpleasantness. That is all there is to it. It is

one  of those unfortunate things that have to be done.

Where did they live before they went there? They had a

few hundred dollars. They bought the house



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



and  they took the risk. That is why they moved in  so

quickly;  sometimes in the very middle  of  the  night

they  moved in. By the very act of moving  in  in  the

middle  of  the  night or in the early  hours  of  the

morning,  they  knew  very well that  they  agreed  to

something which they hoped the police would  not  find

in  time.  And  the fact that they were successful  in

inducing the land bailiff to ignore his responsibility

for  a  few hours in order to let them move in  cannot

alter  the  rights and wrongs of it. We just  have  to

move in in the public interest. Schools have to go up.

Hospitals  have to go up. And we say,  "Sorry.  We  do

what we can. But you have got to get out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the arrears, it is not a question of allowing

them  to  accumulate.  When we  assumed  office  as  a

government,  we  found  a  certain  number  of  houses

already built on Crown land. In the two months  before

we  got down to our job, the number had increased  and

we then had to decide whether we smacked the whole lot

down or allowed the whole lot to get T.O.L.s. We spent

some  time  deliberating with Members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. The Member for Choa Chu Kang also helped  in

the  deliberations. The decision was  made  that  they

should  all  be licensed and that they should  all  be

charged according to the size of the building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin is too educated a man to take

the  line  of the others - just repeating a rumour.  By

repeating  a  rumour,  you  lend  credence  to  it.  A

principal  of  a  secondary  school,  a  man  of  some

maturity  and standing, he comes here and says,  "Land

Office  officials  are told that  this  is  a  Cabinet

decision  to charge so much for each house."  Does  he

believe that the Cabinet of nine Ministers who have to

look after the Housing Board and the City Council, and

what was done before by the City Council and Mayor and

also  by the Government, will spend time in allocating

and  fixing  rents?  All we did was  to  say,  "Charge

according  to  the  size  of  the  building."  If  the

building  is of a handsome size, there are  procedures

and  methods  of  valuing it. From  the  size  of  the

building, you can know the quality



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



of the timber and the cement on the floor and how much

was  spent on them. And the more they spent, the  more

the rent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the arrears of rent. It is not because we did

not want to collect rent. What we wanted to do was  to

smack   the   building's   down,   but   for   various

humanitarian  reasons  we sanctioned  the  whole  lot.

Therefore,  the rents went back to six  months  - I  am

speaking  from memory now. I am sorry the  Member  for

Tanglin did not give notice of the exact nature of the

issue  he wanted to raise. If he had done so, I  would

have given him full particulars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  know that  most  of  the  land  in

Singapore is put under the control of the Land  Office

because  the Government is going to let all the  long-term leases come under the control of the Land Office.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the number of farmers and squatters will

increase. At present residents in squatter areas  have

many  problems  which  have  to  be  resolved  by  the

Government. Government must consider some ways to help

them.  Many  of the squatters who live  in  the  rural

areas know that most of their land belong to the  Land

Office. Very often they put up a blue-print for houses

which  they intend to build but the Land Office  would

delay  their  applications for a very long  time.  The

Land Office do not investigate their applications.  As

a  result, many residents in the rural areas have  had

to  go  to the Land Office in the City Council several

times  to  appeal to the officers concerned to  go  to

their  land and investigate their cases. In  the  end,

these  rural  people have had to waste much  time  and

energy  before  they can get any reply from  the  Land

Office. Under these circumstances, the farmers have to

waste  much  time  and money. At the same  time,  they

incur  much  inconvenience.  Therefore,  I  think  the

Government  must  think of some ways  to  improve  the

procedure  in  dealing with applications for  building

houses.  Only then will they be able to carry out  the

building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



programme as contained in their blueprint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is that those who

stay  on  land  belonging to the Land Office  are  not

allowed by the Government to make extensions to  their

houses.  In  other  words, if they have  five  members

occupying the house and they now wish to apply for  an

extension  to the house which they are occupying,  the

Land   Office   will   usually   not   approve   their

application.  This is especially so  in  the  case  of

those  who are staying on Land belonging to  the  Land

Office.  The Government must consider this point.  The

population  is increasing all the time. This  is  only

natural.  The  members  of  a  family  will  keep   on

increasing very fast. We must not think that there are

only  five members in the family. But that was  a  few

years  ago.  Now  when  they  want  to  apply  for  an

extension  to  their  house, the Government  will  not

approve their application. This policy is very  wrong.

The   Government  should  not  compare   the   present

situation  with  the  past, if  any  member  of   the

household is going to bet married, how can the  couple

stay  in  the  same house if the Government  will  not

approve  their application for an extension  to  their

house!  If  they  are to build a new house,  the  Land

Office  will refuse their application. Therefore,  the

Land  Office  must  try  and  approve  any  reasonable

application  made  by the dwellers  if  they  wish  to

extend their houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government know that most of

the people occupying land belonging to the Land Office

are  poor farmers. Their livelihood depends on farming

and  animal  husbandry. Unfortunately, the  Government

place strict restrictions on applications to build pig-sties and chicken sheds. I do riot say they should not

make  any application. What I am complaining about  is

that there is too much red tape. There are unnecessary

procedures  which the applicants must comply  with  in

order to get their applications approved. Perhaps  the

motive  of the Government is to prevent certain clever

people from building houses on these lands and letting

them out to other people. But we must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



know  that  in the rural areas, houses on  such  lands

cannot  be  let out to others. Moreover, the pig-sties

and  chicken  sheds cannot be used by the  farmers  as

human   habitation.  Therefore,  I   appeal   to   the

Government  to  remove the unnecessary procedures  and

red  tape in the Land Office. This will facilitate the

farmers in their application for an extension of their

house  or  to build pig-sties and chicken sheds.  This

will  help  them  to increase their  business  and  to

improve their livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the sitting of 17th November,

1961, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for

National Development replied to Question No. 36.* The Member for Serangoon Gardens mentioned the question of

Compensation  paid by the Government to squatters  who

had  been  asked by the Government to remove.  I  have

also  received a report given to me on 11th  November,

which was presented by the Parliamentary Secretary  to the Minister for National Development to the Clerk  of the Assembly. As far as I know, this report was handed to the Director of Land Office on 16th February, 1956. The report gives details of compensation rates payable to  squatters who are asked to remove. At the  sitting held  on  the  17th  of  November,  the  Parliamentary Secretary  replied  that  the Government  had  already

altered  these compensation rates. I have  spent  much

time  in checking whether the Government has, in fact,

amended  these  rates.  I have  found  out  that  this

revised  table  is  just the same as  that  which  was

enforced  in  1956. Therefore, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

Government  should not use or apply  the  compensation

rates  which were enforceable in 1959. The  Government

should  not now tell us that they have already amended

the compensation table. Mr Speaker -



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Question No 36 reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Keng Seng: To ask the Minister for National Development (a) when will

the link road between Serangoon Garden Estate and Braddell Road be completed:

(b) how many squatters will be affected by the construction of this road; and

(c) what are the terms of compensation given to such squatters.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Member wishes for a reply,

there are now only four minutes left.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

because of the limited time, I will mention these

things when I come to the Address of thanks to the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. But I hope the

Government will not in future try to fool us about

this amendment to the compensation rates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was going out to attend to some

other business because it was the Member for Choa  Chu

Kang  who was speaking. Sir, whatever he said I  could

put  it  right back on his doorstep, because I left  a

great  deal of Land Office matters to him. He was  the

Assemblyman attached to my Ministry. We left all rural

matters   to   him  and  to  my  former  Parliamentary

Secretary.  So I could have said he had sold  us  out.

Let  him  say anything he likes, and I will come  back

and say, look, he was in charge to get things altered.

The  instructions  to the officials were  that  unless

official policy was contradicted, their representation

should  be implemented. The Member for Choa  Chu  Kang

was  given  a  free hand. My Parliamentary  Secretary,

with  whom he worked in close conjunction, gave him  a

free hand. And they come and say that we cheated them;

we  never altered the rates of compensation! According

to  the notes taken by the Leader of the House and  my

assistants,  he talked about the inefficiency  of  the

Land  Office; that no replies were made to applicants;

that  no investigations were made; and that applicants

spent a lot of time and money. Sir, all these sobs - we

have been through all that. Coming from -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  February  1959,  I  wrote   a

memorandum to the Prime Minister on this question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so, and I discussed the

matter  with  him. I told him to take it up  with  the

Parliamentary  Secretary. I said,  get  things  going.

That was what he was there for. What was he posted  to

my Ministry for? He was given certain specific duties.

He,  representing a rural constituency, was given  the

task   of  sorting  out  the  problems  of  the  rural

constituencies, particularly the farmers. And for  him

to  come  back now and say this was not done and  that

was not done I say, if it was not done, it was because

of  his  shortcomings and inefficiency, because nobody

expects  the Minister to do everything. Authority  has

to  be delegated within certain specified limits.  And

it was. It was because of his own in, eptitude and his

own  inadequacy in getting things moving, through  the

Parliamentary  Secretary, and now he  comes  back  and

puts  it  at  my doorstep. Sir, when all is  said  and

done, I am more and more convinced that so long as  we

work  parliamentary democracy within the rather  loose

confines   of  this  Chamber  - one  can  do  something

outside,  then  come here and spout something;  it  is

quite   safe  to  reproduce  it  because  it  is   all

privileged;  never mind the truth and the accuracy  of

it. The newspapers come out with their speech.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One disavows and throws the responsibility for what

one was formerly responsible on to somebody else. Well

then,  I  say  it just will not work. If  anything  is

amiss, then I say the Member for Choa Chua Kang is  to

blame for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 9 be reduced by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know this post of Chief Planner has been

vacant  for two years. I wonder when this vacancy  can

be  filled.  Does it mean there is no suitable  person

from local sources to fill this post?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I want to raise, i.e., the

post  of  Acting Chief Planner. I want to ask  whether

the    present   Acting   Chief   Planner   has    the

qualifications to hold such a post?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Personally I feel

it  is  very  strange  that the Member  for  Serangoon

Gardens  should all of a sudden change to one  who  is

opposed  to expatriate officers. Originally he  was  a

very reasonable man. Now -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> On a point of order. Is this

relevant in replying to the Member?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was just wondering whether the Acting

Chief  Planner is an expatriate. I do not know. If  he

is an expatriate then perhaps it is relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  you have ruled that I can use only one language

at  a  time  and  cannot change  to  another,  I  have

therefore  to obey you. It is a pity that  the  Member

for Havelock has only one idea, i.e., if somebody says

something  against  him,  he  will  stand  up  to  say

something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has suddenly changed

from  being a reasonable man to one who is against  an

expatriate  officer.  Sir,  we  want  to  solve   this

problem.  When he was a member of the Government,  the

difficulty  then was not whether we had  any  suitable

local  man  to  take  up this post.  The  question  is

this - we do not have a properly trained person to  take

up  this  post. Yes, many people are very  clever  and

talented,  but the question is whether they  are  well

trained enough to take up such a post. Now, this  post

of Chief Planner is not an easy one to fill. It is not

any  Tom, Dick and Harry who can fill such a post.  My

original intention was to say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



that  this  post of Chief Planner is a new  vote.  The

question  is how to ensure that the beautiful  scenery

in  the big city and the convenience of the public  in

general  could  be  looked after. The  present  Acting

Chief Planner is no friend of mine. So if we listen to

what  the Member for Serangoon Gardens has said,  then

we  must give the job to him. In 1957 I went to London

for  talks with colonial officers. At that time he was

still  undergoing  training at  Liverpool  University.

That  was four years ago. Now, of course, he has  made

some progress. But this is in the interest of all  the

people  of  Singapore. It is not  a  question  of  any

personal interest.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> On a point of order. Could the

Prime Minister speak a little less because I have only

three minutes to speak. I have an amendment to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not a point of order. It is a

request.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> (In Mandarin): I am very sorry,

Mr Speaker. Sir. But I must tell the Member concerned

that  he is not like our Member for Hong Lim. Even  if

he wants to learn from him, he will not be successful.

What we do is only in the interests of the people  and

we  can  say so publicly. Therefore, I request him  to

raise questions based on facts, otherwise it will be a

waste  of time. Because he has said something, I  have

to  reply,  and the time of Members in this  House  is

wasted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

agree  with what the Prime Minister has said. We  must

not  waste time. But what we want is information which

is  factual.  I  want  to know  that,  but  the  Prime

Minister  is  trying to drag on from one  question  to

another.  That is a waste of time. So I hope  he  will

not indulge in such things again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir,

Members  in the Opposition are trying deliberately  to

waste   time,  and  that  is  why  they  have   raised

unnecessary questions. Therefore, I have to waste more

time  to  answer  them. This question  was  originally

raised  by  the  Member for Serangoon Gardens.  I  now

stand up to reply that the post of Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



Planner is a very important one. If we do not  have  a

suitably  trained  person available locally,  then  we

must  go abroad to get somebody to fill the post. That

is  obvious. We want to have industrialisation.  Well,

if  we  do  not have a suitable person,  we  may  have

Russian people to come and help us. But we do not want

to  have Russian people because we want to have merger

with  the Federation, so we must go to other countries

to get help in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as

to  what  the Prime Minister has said, is it according

to   the  Standing  Orders  of  this  House  that  the

Opposition  cannot  raise  question?  When  the  Prime

Minister   says   that  we  have  raised   unnecessary

questions, does he mean that we have no right  to  ask

questions of the Government?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is the Speaker who will decide

whether  the  question is relevant  or  irrelevant.  I

might say definitely that there is every right for any
