<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>WITHDRAWAL OF BRITISH BASES IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Prime Minister if he

will  make a statement on the outcome of his  talks

with  the  British  Premier and  his  Ministers  in

London  regarding  the proposed withdrawal  of  the

British Bases in Singapore; and what steps will  be

taken  to  ensure that the economy and  defence  of

Singapore will not suffer as a result.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  the  British Government  has  stated  its

position  in a Supplementary Statement  on  Defence

Policy tabled in their Parliament on the 18th  July

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Far East, they have decided to reach a

reduction  of  about  half the forces  deployed  in

Singapore   and   Malaysia  during   1970-71.   The

reductions  will be so phased that,  by  the  early

1970s,  the  British  forces  still  stationed   in

Singapore  and  Malaysia will  consist  largely  of

naval forces (including an amphibious element)  and

air forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 8 of the Supplementary Statement,

they stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot plan the period beyond 1970-71 in the

same detail. The reductions over the next few years

will  be considerable: we are determined that  they

will  take  place in an orderly manner, which  will

enable  our  Commonwealth partners to adjust  their

plans,  and  will allow Singapore and  Malaysia  to

make  the necessary economic transition as smoothly

as  possible.  We plan to withdraw altogether  from

our  bases in Singapore and Malaysia in the  middle

l970s;   the   precise  timing  of   our   eventual

withdrawal   will  depend  on  progress   made   in

achieving  a  new basis for stability in  Southeast

Asia  and  in resolving other problems in  the  Far

East.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elaboration of the British Government's position

can  be found in the speech of the British Minister

of  Defence, who opened the debate in Parliament on

the 27th July and also in the speech of the British

Prime Minister when he closed the debate that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



same evening. Copies of the Supplementary Statement

and  the Hansard record of the debate are available

in the library. I commend them to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right up till the middle 1970s, a period of

between six years at the earliest and ten years  at

the latest, there will be an actual presence in the

area   consisting  mainly  of  aircraft  and  naval

vessels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 9 of the Statement, the British

Government states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are, therefore, planning to maintain a

military  capability for use, if required,  in  the

area,   even   when  we  no  longer   have   forces

permanently based there.'



<br><br>And in paragraph 10, they stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We do not need to settle the precise character,

size  and  deployment of this  capability  now.  It

would be largely drawn, however, from the forces of

all three Services which would be stationed in this

country  as  a  strategic reserve;  and  we  should

probably  keep  in  the Far  East  some  naval  and

amphibious forces.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These decisions have now been made public. They

require reappraisal and readjustment in the foreign

and  defence  policies of all the governments  that

have  planned their previous policies on the  basis

of  a  continuing British military presence in  the

region into the indefinite future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the 1970s rearrangements will have to be

made  and  will  probably have  been  made  in  the

pattern  of defence in which we must seek  our  own

security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whilst our problems of defence are those of

the middle term and beyond, the economic impact  of

the  defence cuts will be immediate. Total  British

base expenditure constitutes roughly 20 per cent of

Singapore's  G.N.P.  (Gross National  Product).  It

provides direct employment for some 30,000 civilian

employees  in  the armed forces and another  10,000

women  and  girls as domestic help for the  service

families.  About 15,000 of these civilian employees

and  about  5,000 domestic helpers will be  out  of

jobs  by 1971, adding to our already large pool  of

unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem is to lessen the dislocation of our

economy. In this connection, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it

is  useful to recall that from 1819 (the foundation

of Singapore)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



right up to the 1930s there was  a  thriving

and  prosperous Singapore without either a  British

naval  base  or  an  air base. The  Naval  Base  in

Sembawang and the Air Base in Seletar were built in

the  1930s.  It  was only the introduction  of  the

practice  of  allowing serving officers  and  other

ranks to be accompanied by their wives and children

in the 1950s that British base expenditure began to

constitute so sizable a percentage of our G.N.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, over a period of about a decade this figure

will  tail  back to zero. We shall be back  in  the

position   of   the   1930s,where   British    base

expenditure constituted a negligible proportion  of

the economy of Singapore. As I have said, there was

a  thriving  Singapore before the bases were  built

and   manned,   and  if  we  set  about   our   job

intelligently and in good heart, there  will  be  a

bigger and economically more self-reliant Singapore

after  the  bases have been run down and  uniformed

personnel withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems arising out of this process are

being studied by a team headed by Mr Hon Sui  Sen,

Chairman  of our Economic Development Board.  Steps

are  being taken to build up a team of experts  and

consultants  who  can  advise  the  Board  on   the

possible  ways in which the facilities  which  will

become surplus to British service requirements  can

be  converted to civilian user, so as to create the

maximum number of new jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a problem of considerable magnitude and

complexity. Put simply, it is this: what to do with

this  vast military complex, one naval base  and  a

dockyard, three military airfields, and a vast army

complex  of  workshops,  supply  depots  and  other

supporting services. For whilst we will inherit all

the  fixtures which have been built over the  years

on lands made available by the Singapore Government

to the British armed services, we will also inherit

more  than 40,000 bread-winners and their  families

who   have  come  to  Singapore  from  India,  West

Malaysia,  and from places as far off  as  Hongkong

and   Weihaiwei.  With  their  families  they   now

comprise  some  half  a  million  persons;   three-quarters of them are now our citizens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both in their public statements and in

discussions  and  communications  between   British

Ministers  and ourselves, they have made  it  plain

that  they  shared  our  interests  in  maintaining

confidence   in   the   continued   stability   and

prosperity of Singapore and were anxious to  assist

in  meeting economic problems which the run-down of

their  bases, according to programme,  will  cause.

They  have  stated  that they  would  be  ready  to

consider  with us the most effective and productive

uses  of the economic and technical resources  they

could  provide. They have nominated Sir Alan Dudley

of   their  Ministry  of  Overseas  Development  to

conduct discussions with us. We have nominated  Mr

Hon  Sui  Sen. Talks will begin shortly. The  first

matters for discussion will be the kind of  aid  to

deal with the more immediate problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, however significant the aid, the

future  of  Singapore depends upon our capacity  to

maintain  orderly  and stable economic  and  social

conditions as we go through the pangs of withdrawal

of  British base expenditure. The success  of  this

operation depends upon three factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our ability to maintain that climate of

quiet  confidence and the establishment  of  labour

attitudes  and social conditions which will  assure

local  investors  and  overseas  investors  of  the

certainty  of  their planning assumptions  for  the

establishment and expansion of their industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the capacity of our population to adapt

and  to  adjust, without any whimpering or wringing

of  hands, as a way of life to which they have been

accustomed over 30 years comes to an end. The least

of  the  changes contemplated means  that  dockyard

workers,   working  on  naval  vessels  for   naval

commanders, who are not concerned with the  time  a

vessel is out of service whilst undergoing repairs,

have  now  to  adjust their attitudes to  work  and

adapt their methods of work, and also the manner in

which  they may be rewarded for work, to  meet  the

needs of ship-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



owners who want their vessels repaired in as little

a  time as possible, as every hour in repair  means

vast  sums  of  money in loss of earnings.  At  the

worst,  it  means being able, sometimes at  a  very

difficult  age  of  life for the  people  in  their

middle 40's and above to make the painful change of

earning  a living in a different way - from  being  a

storekeeper or a clerk to a skilled, semiskilled or

even a manual worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor is whether the economic aid that

we  have  been promised will be substantial  enough

and  utilised  intelligently enough to  create  the

maximum number of jobs. Whether British performance

will be equal to their promises will in part depend

upon the performance of Britain's own economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will be foolish to believe that others can

do  for us what we as a people, and organised as  a

representative  government, must do for  ourselves.

From our past performance, given no ill-fortune, it

is  more  than likely that we can and will make  up

for  the loss of this 20 per cent G.N.P. which will

take  place  over the next decade. Our economy  has

grown  at  the rate of 6 to 9 per cent  per  annum,

except  for  the  first full year of confrontation,

1964,  when the increase was only 2 per  cent.  But

what  we  may  not  be  able  to  do,  unless   our

performance is better than that of the  last  eight

years,  is to create meaningful jobs as the  annual

15,000 to 20,000 young boys and girls who now  come

into the labour market are joined by another 40,000

workers,  30,000 of whom are our citizens who  will

be  put  out of employment from the British  bases.

Air  the  family  planning  and  other  methods  of

controlling  population which we may  have  to  use

will  be  of  great  benefit to whoever  forms  the

government  in the late '70s and '80s. But  we  are

already  saddled with the baby boom of the post-war

years of the 1940s and early 1950s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have assured the British Government of our co-operation to ensure the orderly withdrawal of their

forces and the run-down of their Bases according to

programme.  The civilian employees'  union  leaders

have reacted in a rational



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



and  intelligent way in the best interests of their

members and of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board team has visited

most  of  the  base installations which  the  three

Services  may  be giving up between now  and  1971.

Consultations  and discussions will go  on  between

our officers and the officers of the three Services

to work out intelligently and in a friendly way how

their redundant base facilities can be put to  some

economic   use.  It  is  our  intention  that   the

changeover  will  be done in a  quiet  and  orderly

fashion and with goodwill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  when  our Prime  Minister  and  his

Cabinet  Ministers went to London  to  discuss  the

withdrawal  of  the British troops from  our  area,

after  which the British Government issued a  White

Paper on this, I have also read this White Paper in

which there is a statement to the effect that  when

the British are withdrawing their troops from here-



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim, could you get to your

supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, my question

is  related to economic aid. In the White Paper  it

is  stated  that  when the British  withdraw  their

troops from Singapore, they would give economic aid

and  other  means  to help the countries  affected.

There  is  the term "significant aid".  This  would

give  people  the impression that  there  would  be

economic  aid. Whether or not such significant  aid

would  be  forthcoming,  will  the  Prime  Minister

explain   to   us  what  kind  of  aid   would   be

forthcoming? In the past we have said that we would

rather have trade than economic aid. That was  also

stated by the Prime Minister some time ago.  Can  I

have   the   Prime   Minister's  clarification   or

elaboration on this? If the so-called economic  aid

is  just  like  the type given to  other  countries

which  are  receiving foreign aid, then it  may  be

inconsistent with our policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

intend to anticipate the out-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



come  of the first discussions between Mr Hon  and

Sir Alan Dudley. But purely expressing our attitude

or  approach  to  the problem, we  would  like  the

British  Government to give us notice of  those  of

their  facilities found redundant,  as  quickly  as

possible,  and to hand over to civilian  management

some of those facilities even whilst they are still

in  military  use,  as in the  case  of  the  naval

dockyard - if this were possible. Secondly, any such

assistance  whether direct grants or technical  and

other  assistance,  should be designed  to  provide

Singapore  with the kind of industries  which  will

not  make  us dependent on perpetual injections  of

aid from outside. I can assure the Member for Bukit

Merah  that we cannot change our attitude to  life,

that  the world does not owe us a living - and  that

we  cannot  live by the begging bowl.  This  is  an

unhappy  disengagement which has come earlier  than

either they or we expected. The best way of meeting

the   problem  is  to  go  about  it  quietly   and

intelligently discussing our problems in a low key,

and with as little fuss and bother as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho See Beng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Question No. 4.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  policy is  that  an  officer's

confirmation and his prospects for promotion should

not  be  affected  by  his secondment  for  service

outside  the Government service. Although  this  is

the  policy  and the intention, it is obvious  that

unless  care  is exercised over the length  of  the

period  of  secondment,  this  may  not  happen  in

practice.  The  reason is that  if  an  officer  is

seconded for an unduly long period of time, it  may

not  be  possible  to  assess his  suitability  for

confirmation or promotion, especially if the nature

of  the  duties of the post to which he is seconded

differs vastly from that of the service to which he

belongs. To ensure that the interest of the officer

would not be adversely affected, it is the practice

to  limit the period of secondment in the  case  of

probationers  to within one year. Because  of  this

precaution, no case is known where the confirmation

or  promotion  prospects of an  officer  have  been

adversely  affected  by  a  secondment  to  a  post

outside the service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Sir, in view

of  the answer by the Parliamentary Secretary, what

is  he  going  to do to safeguard the  interest  of

those permanent officers who are seconded?

Speaker, Sir, I can assure the hon. Member that  an

adversely affected by reason of his secondment  for

service  outside the Government service  itself.  I

have  explained,  in answer to  the  hon.  Member's

previous   question,  how  this  can  be  adversely

affected  if the secondment is not properly  worked

out.

4,  the  Parliamentary Secretary did  say  that  in

give us details as to what safeguards there are  to

ensure that the interests of seconded officers  are

not jeopardised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I said in my answer that the

precaution  is  that the officer  who  is  due  for

promotion or confirmation is not seconded for  more

than one year.

<div align="center"><b>PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF LOCAL INDUSTRIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Finance,  with  a view to promoting and  protecting

local industries whose production capacity can meet

the  demands  of  local  consumption,  if  he  will

consider  prohibiting the importation  of  products

similar to those of such local industries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> The

policy  of the Government with regard to protection

of  local industries is quite clear. The Government

is  prepared  to grant protection to industries  if

several   factors  are  satisfied.   Firstly,   the

industry  must be in a position to supply  a  major

part  of  the local market. Secondly, the  industry

should  result in a net gain to the economy by  way

of foreign exchange savings, local income generated

and  local  employment created.  In  addition,  the

industry should as far as possible be one with some

export  potential. The industry must show  evidence

of being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



willing  and able to compete in the export  market.

Thus it can be seen that the productive capacity of

an  industry  alone is not sufficient  to  conclude

that  it  should be protected. There are  other  no

less   important   factors   to   be   taken   into

consideration.  In considering the actual  measures

to  be  adopted, we have learned through experience

that prohibition of imports is not the best means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, such prohibition does not set an

automatic limit to the extent to which local prices

can increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, prohibition of imports would mean that

the  local  industry  would be  divorced  from  the

competitive  pressures of new designs and  improved

quality  which  are constantly being  developed  by

industries abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, prohibition creates a situation which

opens the administration to business pressures  and

enticements. It also results in a very high premium

for   the   imported  products,  which   encourages

smuggling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons the Government would prefer to

grant  protection  in the form  of  import  duties.

There  are,  of  course, cases  where  quantitative

restrictions  on  imports  are  necessary  in   the

initial stages of an industry's existence. In  such

cases, the Government is prepared to consider  such

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summing up, the Government is prepared to

consider measures to protect local industries  from

imports,  but  does  not  consider  prohibition  of

imports as the best means of doing so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Government  has  imposed  a

quota  on  textiles and singlets. As  a  result  of

this,  there is an increase of ten cents or  so  in

the price of singlets. Does the Government have any

measures to prevent price increases?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Firstly, I think this supplementary

question does not arise out of my answer. Secondly,

the  Finance  Minister explained  very  elaborately

about this yesterday.

<div align="center"><b>ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS' CONFERENCE AT BANGKOK</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs if he will make a statement on  the

achievements  of  the conference of  ASEAN  Foreign

Ministers held at Bangkok recently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  if he will make a statement on the outcome

of  the Conference of the Association of South-East

Asian Nations (ASEAN) held at Bangkok recently  and

state in what way Singapore can benefit by being  a

member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission, I shall answer Questions Nos. 7  and  8

together. Sir, I do not propose to give a  detailed

account of the aims and purposes of the Association

of South-east Asian Nations, or ASEAN for short, as

these   have   already  been   published   in   the

newspapers.  Very briefly, ASEAN is an organisation

to  accelerate economic growth, social progress and

cultural  development in the region  through  joint

endeavours   in   the  spirit   of   equality   and

partnership. This is the essence of ASEAN. However,

what  I would like to stress is that ASEAN as  such

is  not  concerned with military  problems  of  the

region.  This  is not to say that member  countries

are  disinterested  in defence  matters.  In  fact,

economic  and  social progress in the region  would

become  well  nigh  impossible if  these  countries

cannot  safeguard  their  national  integrity   and

security. However, one of the consequences  of  the

successful  realisation of the aims and objects  of

ASEAN  would  be  to bring economic  stability  and

thereby enhance prospects for peace and security in

the  region. In this sense, and only in this sense,

is  ASEAN  an organisation for promoting peace  and

security  in  the region. Economic  life  today  is

rooted  in  interdependence, and national frontiers

do not coincide with our actual economic frontiers.

The  advanced and economically-developed  countries

of the West, both Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



and  non-Communist, realise this. The two  Americas

constitute,   for  all  practical   purposes,   one

gigantic   working  economic  bloc.  The  Communist

countries  of  the  West have  their  COMICON.  The

highly  industrialised countries of Western  Europe

have  formed themselves into an economic community.

At  such  a time when most countries of the  world,

especially the advanced countries of the world, are

welding  themselves into bigger and bigger economic

units, the countries of South-east Asia, which  are

relatively under-developed and small, cannot go  on

believing  that  economic  nationalism  and   self-sufficiency are the sure roads to modernisation and

progress.   ASEAN   is,   therefore,   the    first

substantive  step we have taken with  other  South-east Asian countries towards a regional economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok we agreed that

regional  co-operation should begin not  merely  by

declaring  good intentions embodied  in  the  ASEAN

Declaration,  but to go a step further  and  pursue

projects  which are relatively simple in that  they

are  those  in  which, no strong  vested  national

interests  are  involved.  The  Standing  Committee

which  was  set up has been asked to  consider  and

make proposals for joint development programmes  on

such  subjects as tourism, shipping, fisheries  and

what is called expansion of intra-regional trade at

the  next  Ministerial meeting in Jakarta. However,

hon.  Members  will agree that the good  intentions

embodied  in  the ASEAN declaration alone  are  not

sufficient.  They  have  to  run  the  gauntlet  of

political   difficulties   before   they   can   be

translated  into  action.  As  such,  it  will   be

unrealistic to expect a dramatic leap into regional

co-operation.  We  should remember  that  even  the

European Economic Community took some ten years  of

haggling before it got off the ground. But for  the

time  being, we should be satisfied if there  is  a

steady, even if slow, movement towards regionalism.

ASEAN  is South-east Asia's first major attempt  to

apply to South-east Asia and its problems the  more

hopeful and fruitful idea of regionalism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister

explain to the House what effects the formation  of

ASEAN will have on the Association of South Asia?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Sir, since Singapore is not a member

of  ASA, I think this is .a matter for the original

members  - the three countries - to decide. But  they

have made public what they feel would be the impact

of  ASEAN, and it is this. The more ASEAN succeeds.

the  less  use would there be for ASA in  that  ASA

would be absorbed into ASEAN.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, will the

Minister  for Foreign Affairs explain  whether  the

ASEAN   set-up   will  lead  to  a  common   market

arrangement between the member countries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes. As far as Singapore is

concerned,   a  common  market  is   one   of   the

objectives, and I am glad to say that a  number  of

countries, particularly Indonesia, since my  recent

visit  there, have indicated an interest in  seeing

that ASEAN in the course of time also develops into

a common market region.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now that we have

joined  ASEAN, can the Minister for Foreign Affairs

inform  us whether there will be any effect on  our

foreign  policy? There has been talk outside  that,

as  a result of British withdrawal, we will have to

review  our original non-alignment policy. Can  the

Minister elaborate on and clarify this point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As I have stated, Sir, ASEAN is a

scheme   for  economic  co-operation.  It  is   not

military.  It  does  not affect our  basic  foreign

policies  and  certainly  not  Singapore's  foreign

policy,  though we might have to adjust our foreign

policy. This has nothing to do with ASEAN but  with

changing circumstances in the region. But ASEAN  as

such  does  not in any way bind us to  any  foreign

policy that we do not want to pursue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has also

been said that the ultimate objective of ASEAN is a

political union. Would the Foreign Minister comment

on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> At the moment, I do not think we

should  consider  any other objectives  than  those

declared in ASEAN and those, at the moment, do  not

contain   any  political  objectives  but  economic

objectives.  I am in no position to say  what  will

happen in 5, 10, 20 or 50 years from now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Can the Minister

say  whether, among the members of ASEAN, there are

some who were members of Maphilindo? Can he explain

whether the spirit of Maphilindo has any effect  on ASEAN?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir, it will have no effect,

because the members of ASEAN subscribe to the  aims

and  objectives  of ASEAN. Whether  they  have  any

other arrangements outside of ASEAN is none of  our

concern. After all, we belong to the United Nations

where there are 126 members ranging from Maphilindo

to   other   beliefs   - Communist,   non-Communist,

capitalist,  democratic and so on.  The  fact  that

members  have  different ideologies does  not  mean

that they do in any way commit ASEAN to depart from

the   declared  objectives  which  have  been  made

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been

given a very clear picture of what the ASEAN set-up

is.  But  can the Minister for Foreign Affairs  say

recruited any religious teachers this year  because

the  slight  increase  in  the  number  of  classes

requiring instruction in Islamic religion  has  not

necessitated  the  recruitment  of  any  additional

religious teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part of the hon. Member's

question, religious teachers are posted to  schools

based  on the number of periods of Islamic religion

tention is that a cumulative record should be  kept

of  every pupil from the day he enters school until

he  leaves school. Periodical entries will be  made

in this card not only in respect of those qualities

mentioned by the Member for Paya Lebar, but also in

respect of changes in his family circumstances, his

forms of ultra-modern attire when discharging their

official duties.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is desirable that

children under their charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member's point is well taken and

teachers  will  be  encouraged to dress  decorously

rather than decoratively when on duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's suggestion that teachers

should  wear  a  uniform  standard  of  dress,  the

Ministry  will  seek  the  views  of  the   various

teachers' unions on the subject.

<div align="center"><b>(Number withdrawn)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Health  the  number  of  licences  withdrawn   from

hawkers who are not Singapore citizens in the  last

six months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been

the  policy of the Hawkers Department, as long  ago

as  1961,  not  to issue licences to  non-Singapore

citizens. During the recent reorganisation  of  the

department,  it has been discovered, however,  that

out  of  a total of 26,000 licences issued so  far,

437  non-citizens, or 2 per cent  of  the  hawkers,

have been issued with such licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances as to how these came to be

issued  are being investigated into. The department

is,  however, being seriously hampered in its work,

because many important documents and files are  not

available  and claimed to have been lost  during  a

mysterious fire which gutted the office building of

the  Hawkers Department at Canning Rise in  October

1964 - three years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, about 200 non-citizen hawkers seeking

renewal  of their licences have had their  licences

detained  by  the department, but  they  have  been

issued  with  authority slips to carry on  business

pending completion of investigation.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  to  my knowledge, some  non-citizen

hawkers  have  been residing in  this  country  for

about ten years. They have not acquired citizenship

because they have encountered difficulties in their

applications for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



citizenship. Their licences were held up when  they

went  to  renew  them recently. Will  the  Minister

consider  favourably  their applications  to  renew

their licences?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As indicated in my reply, the

cases  of non-citizen hawkers holding licences  are

being  investigated into, because it is the  policy

not to issue licences to non-citizens. So there  is

a possibility that non-citizens have obtained their

hawkers'  licences  through  corruption.  We  must,

therefore,  fully  investigate  the  matter.  I  am

prepared  to  consider their cases  sympathetically

provided   the   Members  of  Parliament   of   the

respective  constituencies  are  prepared  to  make

their recommendations, and this is being done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

can  the  Minister  for  Health  say  whether,   in

detaining their licences, he has taken note of  the

principle of our work permit policy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is the policy of the Hawkers

Department  not  to issue hawker licences  to  non-

citizens.  If a non-citizen gets a hawker  licence,

therefore, something is wrong. If it is the work of

an  official  who  has  issued  the  licence,  then

something  serious has happened. The  official  has

granted  the licence against policy and, therefore,

it  is  necessary  to investigate  fully  into  the

matter   - who  is  responsible  for  issuing   that

licence? And if, as the Member for Delta has  said,

the  particular non-citizen hawker has been staying

in  Singapore  for quite a considerable  length  of

time,  surely  the  Member of Parliament  for  that

constituency  should be in a position to  ascertain

that and to make recommendations which will receive

our sympathetic consideration.

Health's decision to proceed with the long  overdue

reorganisation of the Public Cleansing  Department,

Government  decided  that all those, who  went  on

strike  had sacked themselves. However, as a  large

number of cleansing workers may have been prevented

from presenting themselves for work as a result  of

the  activities of instigators and pickets, and  as

the  Ministry did not wish to penalise  the  honest

hard-working workers, whether Singapore citizens or

non-citizens, it was decided that those workers who

desired  reappointment could  call  personally  and

complete application forms at six centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of a total of 2,281 such applications for re-

employment,  2,047 were accepted for temporary  re-

employment subject to review after six months or 12

months.  Of this, 234 were rejected. So  far,  only

one rejected case has been subsequently re-employed

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not understand what is the meaning of "rejected

of  dismissal,  or  does it mean  that  the  worker

cannot work any more anywhere else?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I wish the Member for Anson

had  followed my answer. I have stated that because

of  the illegal strike, Government had decided that

all  those  who  did  not turn  up  for  work  were

considered to have sacked themselves. And then they

were  allowed, only if they wanted to work, to  re-apply   for   employment.   They   put   in   their

applications and they were not considered suitable;

so  they were rejected. Therefore, they do not  get

employment  in  the Ministry of  Health,  but  they

could apply for work anywhere else in Singapore  if

they wish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what was the

reason for rejecting those 184?

bad.   They   were   bad  workers,   either   lazy,

but were getting paid by the Government!



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, will the

<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Dr Chew Chin Han</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a)  the  number of cases  of  haemorrhagic

fever  in  Singapore annually since  1962  and  the

mortality  rate;  and (b) whether any  research  on

this  disease  has  been carried out  in  Singapore

particularly  in the search for a better  and  more

effective treatment, or has there merely  been  the

exchange  of views with African countries, Thailand

and the Philippines.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the number of known cases

of  haemorrhagic fever in Singapore since 1962  and

its mortality rate are as follows : -



<pre>

                 Year    Number Admitted    Number Died

                 1962         185                2

                 1963         208                6

                 1964         375                7

                 1965          43                1

                 1966         659               24

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be explained that haemorrhagic fever is

not a notifiable disease, and the figures asked for

by the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



for  Tampines, going as far back as 1962,  may  not

reflect  the true situation according to the  known

available figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with effect from 18th October last year,

doctors   working  in  Government   hospitals   and

outpatient dispensaries were instructed  to  notify

such  cases  to  the  Ministry of  Health  and  the

relatively  high figure for 1966 may be partly  due

to this directive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the second part of his question, I am

pleased to say that research on haemorrhagic  fever

has been going on since 1960 when it first appeared

in Singapore. So far, 22 papers have been published

in  Singapore.  A  list* (* Appendix, cols. 243-6.) will

be  handed  to  the  Speaker,  and  I have also handed

a  copy  to  the Member  for Tampines. It covers the

whole range  of problems  connected  with the  disease

from  basic research  on  the  mosquito vector,  the

causative virus, and to the clinical features and treatment.

<div align="center"><b>ANTI-MOSQUITO CONTROL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Chew Chin Han</b> asked the Minister for

Health  whether the present methods used  in  anti-mosquito   control  are  also  effective   in   the

extermination  of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito  which

is responsible for the transmission of haemorrhagic

fever and which is resistant to D.D.T.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, present

methods   of   anti-mosquito  control   are   aimed

primarily  against the malaria mosquito  (the  type

known   as   Anopheles  maculatus   and   Anopheles

sundaicus). (I am afraid I have not done my  Latin;

so  the  accent  may not be quite  right.)  As  the

mosquitoes  which transmit haemorrhagic  fever  are

different,  namely,  Aedes species,  other  methods

will have to be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods are mainly against the larval

stages  of  these  mosquitoes.  A  one-year   pilot

project, which was carried out in the Geylang  area

bounded by Sims Avenue, Paya Lebar Road, Sungei



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



Kallang  and  Sungei Geylang since  September  last

year,  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  simple

measures  by  elimination of  breeding  places  and

public  education  through  television,  radio  and

pamphlets,  and  by  personal  contacts  with   the

residents.  The  mosquito index  fell  within  five

weeks  from an original 10 per cent to about 2  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As complete eradication of the mosquito vectors

may  not be a practical possibility, what is  aimed

at  is  effective control, in order  to  bring  the

mosquito  index down to insignificant numbers.  For

the present, D.D.T. appears to be effective against

the   local   strains   of   mosquitoes,   although

resistance has already been reported in most  parts

of South East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also making determined efforts to improve

environmental sanitation in urban constituencies by

clearing  blocked drains, which are the  cause  for

stagnant  water and thus become excellent  breeding

grounds  for mosquitoes. This involves many aspects

of  public health, especially licensing and control

of    hawkers   (who   are   chief   culprits   for

irresponsible  dumping  of  refuse  into   drains),

better  drainage and unslabbing of roadside drains,

as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be of interest to the Member for Tampines

to  know  that  a W.H.O. Consultant on haemorrhagic

fever  will be visiting the following countries  in

the    Western   Pacific   Region,   namely,    the

Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore,  next

month  (October).  The purpose of the  consultant's

visit will be to hold preliminary discussions  with

clinicians and scientists on (a) criteria  for  the

establishment  of common definitions for  reporting

cases of haemorrhagic fever, and (b) some technical

aspects  of  haemorrhagic  fever  surveillance  and

control.

dealings  with drugs and poisons daily  than,  say,

dentists  and  pharmacists,  if  he  will  consider

representation   of   that   Association   on   the

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the Poisons Advisory

Committee  is  a non-statutory administrative  body

set  up  to advise the Minister for Health  and  is

without executive or legal powers. At present,  the

Outram Road General Hospital, and (3) the Professor

of Clinical Medicine, University of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, therefore, that the medical view-

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Car

Park  Division has to date established 347 bays  in

which about 2,594 motor-cycles and scooters can  be

parked.  A  survey  was  recently  carried  out  in

respect  of  parking  lots  for  motor-cycles   and

scooters.  The  survey  indicates  that  the   bays

provided have not been fully used. For example,  in

the City centre only about 66 per cent of the space

provided is occupied. Apparently motor-cyclists and

scooterists prefer to park their vehicles  as  near

to  their destination as possible on verandahs  and

side-walks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The

many riders of motor-cycles and scooters park their

motor-cycles  and  scooters in the  five-foot  way.

This  proves my point that it is difficult  to  get

parking   lots   for  scooters  and   motor-cycles.

According to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>

the law.

more  parking lots with the fact that  people  park

their  motor-cycles and scooters on  the  five-foot

way?" Is that what you wanted him to explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I

it  would consider increasing the parking lots for

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just

now  given my answer that the parking lots provided

are  occupied. I do not see any justifiable  reason

for  increasing  the parking lots for  motor-cycles

Tanjong Rhu Estate, while the re-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



maining 115 families have elected to find their own

accommodation.  Of  the  74  small  industries,  10

furniture    makers   have   accepted   alternative

accommodation  in  flatted factories  at  Bendemeer

Road.  37  boat-builders and charcoal and  firewood

importers  have been relocated in the  Tanjong  Rhu

resettlement  area.  Four  rattan  processing   and

timber  yard  operators have been  resited  in  the

resettlement areas in Tampines or Lim Chu Kang, and

15  other  small  industries have found  their  own

accommodation  elsewhere.  There  are  eight  other

small  industries  which are  still  on  the  site.

However,   four  of  these  have  already  accepted

alternative accommodation offered by the Board  and

they   are   expected   to  move   to   their   new

accommodation  by  the  end of  this  month.  Every

effort is being made to find suitable sites for the

remaining cases. All 70 motor workshops have  found

their  own  accommodation  elsewhere.  Of  the   26

shopkeepers,  six  have accepted  alternative  shop

accommodation   in  the  Housing  and   Development

Board's  housing  estates,  and  the  remaining  20

shopkeepers have found their own accommodation. All

the 81 small warehouses or stores have already been

demolished  as their operators have either  cleared

all  their stores to their other warehouses or have

found alternative accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that nearly all resettlement

cases affected by the Golden Mile development  have

been satisfactorily resolved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, can the

Minister say whether any compensation has been paid

to  all those affected by urban renewal and at what

rates? Also what is the total sum paid out so far?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the rate of compensation for a

building is $2.50 per square foot if the owner  can

prove  that  the building was built pre-war  or  is

covered by an approved plan from the Chief Building

Surveyor.  In  all  other  cases,  a  building   is

compensated at $1 per square foot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For resettlement cases, a disturbance allowance

of $250 for both hut owner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



and  sub-tenant and a transport allowance  of  $100

for  the  hut  owner and $50 for the sub-tenant  is

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> In the case of owners of

warehouses, I am given to understand that  most  of

them  have found their own accommodation. But  more

often  than not, the owners usually find difficulty

in  getting their applications for change of use of

difficulty   in   applications  to   the   Planning

question, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> If they wish to build their

warehouses  on their own land, will the  Government

consider  giving them assistance so as to  expedite

their applications?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I confirm that most of the

warehouses or the owners of warehouses have shifted

to other places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as zoning is concerned, the hon. Member

for  Mountbatten understands that land in Singapore

is  zoned according to what use can be made of  it,

such  as agricultural land, land for warehouses  or

residential  land. And if any of these Golden  Mile

squatters  want  to  set  up  a  warehouse   in   a

residential  area,  naturally  they  would  not  be

allowed.  This will entail a change of zoning.  But

we  always give consideration when these people are

moved out, and if it can be done, for instance,  on

the  outskirts  of residential areas,  my  planners

would recommend a change of zoning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Chief Building Surveyor's Department,

even  if  one owns the land on which one wishes  to

build,  certain  building regulations  have  to  be

complied with. The Chief Building Surveyor  is  not

going out of his way to make difficulties for these

people,   but   there  are  building  by-laws   and

regulations which must be complied with.

currently  a  secondary distributor  road  and  the

proposal   to  convert  this  road  into   a   dual

carriageway  is  basically  a  long-term   planning

consideration. At present, it is not justifiable to

widen this road into a dual carriage-way because of

space  limitation and because other  roads  in  the

network,  like Outram Road, have not been  widened.

To  widen Tiong Bahru Road alone will not serve any

general purpose in easing the flow of traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member will be pleased to know that

the  Government is now undertaking a  comprehensive

study  of the road network system for the whole  of

Singapore.   Until  such  time  when  the   overall

position is assessed, it is not possible to justify

the  need  to  widen Tiong Bahru Road into  a  dual

carriageway. However, it is anticipated  that  this

maintain a stable price all the year round so as to

enable  poultry  farmers to make a living  with-out

much economical hardship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, I am aware of the low

prices  in  recent  months, but  the  hon.  Member

should  know  that the prices of  eggs  depend  on

supply and demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to statistics collected by the Primary

Production Department, the ex-farm prices  of  eggs

dropped  to  an average of 6.8 cents in March  last

and  the  retail price to an average of 8.1  cents.

The  Primary  Production Department, in conjunction

with  the  Singapore Livestock Farmers' Association

and    the   Singapore   Stockfeed   Manufacturers'

Association, organised a campaign to slaughter  old

and  unproductive hens. Between the 20th  of  March

and  the  19th of May this year, about 30,600  hens

were slaughtered. This measure prevented egg prices

from falling further. Since then, there has been an

upward  trend  in  egg prices, and  in  August  the

average ex-farm price of eggs was 8.8 cents and the

average retail price 10.2 cents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, only yesterday, the Minister of

Defence had to take great pains to explain why  the

prices  of various goods in Singapore have gone  up

recently. It is refreshing for me to have to answer

a  question querying why the price of eggs has gone

down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Has the Minister got the

statistics  to indicate the prices of eggs  in  the

last few years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The average prices of eggs for the

last few years were as follows:



<pre>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Will the Minister give me an

assurance  that his Ministry will keep  a  watchful

eye  on the fluctuations in egg prices in order  to

protect the poultry farmers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I give the hon. Member my assurance

now.  The  Primary Production Department is  always

keeping  a  watchful eye on the price of  eggs  not

only  for the sake of the farmers but also for  the

sake of the consumers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Would the Minister consider

setting  up  an Egg Buying Board as  a  measure  to

maintain the stability of egg prices?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> At the moment, I do not think that an

Egg  Buying Board is required. But I do not profess

to  be an expert on this subject and I will ask the

Director  of  Primary Production to look  into  the

suggestion made by the Member for Choa Chu Kang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, E think this

supplementary question may be slightly  outside  of

the  original  question, but it is  related  to  it

anyway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was given to understand that there was a

proposal  to  set  up an egg factory  to  turn  the

surplus  eggs  into all kinds of nutritious  tinned

food  to  be  sold to the market. Is  the  Minister

aware of this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There was such a proposal but it

remained and still is just a proposal. But I  would

advise  the  Member  for  Punggol  to  direct   his

inquiries  to the Minister for Finance, who  is  in

charge  of the Economic Development Board, so  that

such a factory could be set up in Jurong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Will the Minister concerned

-whether  he  be the Minister for Law and  National

Development or the Minister for Finance -take steps

to implement this proposal?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am not in charge of the Economic

Development  Board.  At the  most,  I  can  ask  my

Director of Primary Production to sound first,  not

the  Economic  Development Board, but  the  farmers

whose hens produce the eggs.

<div align="center"><b>VIGILANTE CORPS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I beg to move, "That the  Vigilante

Corps Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to provide for

the  establishment and maintenance of the Vigilante

Corps. Hitherto the Vigilante Corps has existed  as

an  organisation  without any statutory  provisions

since its formation in May 1964.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



The Bill provides that the existing Vigilante Corps

shall,  as  from  the  date  of  the  coming   into

operation of the Act, be deemed to have been raised

and  maintained under the Act, thus giving the body

a legal standing (clause 25).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranks of the Vigilante Corps up till now had

been filled by person volunteering to be members of

the  Corps.  These volunteer members who registered

themselves as corps members came from various walks

of  life, ranging from watchmen to businessmen, and

from clerks to hawkers. These persons had powers of

ordinary  citizens and their main  duties  were  to

perform  foot  patrols,  coastal  observations,  to

assist  the  police in reporting  the  movement  or

presence   of  suspicious  characters,  to   arrest

persons  committing  any  seizable  offence  within

their  sight,  and  to assist the  public  whenever

requested. With the establishment of the  Vigilante

Corps,  it was observed that the crime rate dropped

in  areas  covered  by  the Vigilante  Corps  Beat-Patrols.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes provision for national

servicemen  to  be  directed for  national  service

under  the  National Service Ordinance, 1952,  with

the  Vigilante Corps. Thus the Vigilante Corps will

consist of both volunteers and national servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national servicemen who are called up for

training  in the Vigilante Corps will do 12  years'

part-time  training during their off-work  or  off-duty hours. They will receive, in addition to their

many duties, instruction in moral values. This will

teach  them  the  meaning of good  citizenship  and

explain   to  them  the  nature  of  their   social

responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national servicemen will be contributing to

our  nation  building and this is  a  sure  way  of

creating loyalty and national consciousness, and if

the  need  arises  they can show their  loyalty  by

participating in the defence of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national servicemen being called up are young

men.  Opportunity,  therefore, is  being  given  to

these  youngsters  not  just to  remain  spectators

outside the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



orbit  of  the defence forces but to take  part  as

part-time soldiers, be it the Vigilante Corps,  the

P.D.F.,  the  Special Constabulary,  or  the  Army.

These  young men are the natural resources  of  our

country  and  we  have to teach  them  a  sense  of

discipline and responsibility if they are to become

responsible  citizens. The training and  discipline

will  make them better citizens and better workmen.

Physically  and  mentally  the  benefit   will   be

enormous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to deal with the more important

clauses  in  the  Bill. Clause  4  deals  with  the

composition of the Corps, that is, it provides that

the  Corps shall consist of national servicemen and

volunteers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides that members of the

Corps   shall  assist  the  Police  Force  in   the

maintenance  of law and order, the preservation  of

public  peace,  the  prevention  and  detection  of

crime, and the apprehension of offenders; and shall

perform such other functions and duties as  may  be

assigned by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 deals with the appointment of a

Commandant.   The   Corps  shall   be   under   his

administration and his appointment is made  by  the

Minister. The Commandant shall be under the general

direction of the Commissioner of Police. In  clause

9,  power  is given to the Minister to  disband  or

discontinue the Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important section in the Bill is clause 10.

This  provides that members of the Corps will  have

to  take an oath or affirmation in such form as may

be  prescribed by the Minister, and any member  who

refuses to do so shall be guilty of an offence  and

shall  be  liable  on  conviction  to  a  fine  not

exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term  not

exceeding  six  months or to  both  such  fine  and

imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 provides for resignation and discharge

of  members  from  the Corps, and applies  only  to

volunteer members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Corps  who may resign by giving  14  days'

notice  to  the Commandant provided they  have  not

been  called  out for mobilized service  under  the

Act.  Power is given to the Commandant to discharge

any  volunteer member of the Corps where he  is  of

the  opinion  that  such member is  not  likely  to

become  or  remain  useful in the  Corps.  National

servicemen cannot resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides that the national servicemen

shall not be discharged, retired or dismissed  from

the  Corps  except with the prior approval  of  the

proper   authority  appointed  under  the  National

Service Ordinance, 1952.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 deals with mobilization. The President

may  declare a state of emergency and, in pursuance

thereof,  the  whole or any part of  the  Vigilante

Corps may be called out for mobilized service.  The

members called out will remain so called out  until

they  are  released from mobilized service  by  the

Commandant with the Minister's approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As national service is a compulsory service the

national service members of the Vigilante Corps may

not unlawfully absent themselves from duty. If they

do  so,  they shall be deemed to have deserted  and

shall  be guilty of an offence and shall be  liable

on  conviction  to  imprisonment  for  a  term  not

exceeding  12 months. This provision  is  found  in

clause 15 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17 to 23 respectively deal with the

discipline  and  punishment of rank  and  file  and

subordinate  officers and officers. The  Commanding

Officers  may inflict punishment commensurate  with

the  offence.  The words "Commanding Officer"  have

been  defined in the interpretation section to mean

the  Deputy  Commissioner  of  Police,  the  Senior

Assistant  Commissioner of Police, and an Assistant

Commissioner  of  Police,  the  Commandant  of  the

Police  Training  School  and  any  police  officer

lawfully acting in any of these appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision also in clause 21 of the Bill

to  punish  members of the Corps  who  threaten  or

insult any police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



officer  or  Vigilante Corps member  of  senior  or

equal  rank;  and in this connection  authority  is

given  to  any  police officer to  arrest,  without

warrant, any member of the Corps so accused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 of the Bill empowers the Minister to

make  regulations with respect to the Constitution,

general administration, training and welfare of the

Corps and any other matters in connection with  the

Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I fully

support the Vigilante Corps Bill. Its purpose is to

enable members of the Vigilante Corps to be a  more

disciplined  force  in order  to  help  our  police

maintain law and order and public security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we can all recall that the Vigilante

Corps  was set up in April 1964 when Indonesia  was

in  confrontation against us and when there  was  a

series  of  sabotage  and  bomb  incidents  in  our

country.  And  in order to protect  the  lives  and

property of our people, the Prime Minister (Mr Lee

Kuan Yew then) called for the setting-up of such  a

Corps.  We  all  know the historical background  of

this  Corps. The Prime Minister's call  was  warmly

supported by people of all walks of life. The  bomb

incidents  and  the  series of  sabotage  acts  had

caused some damage to property, if they had not  at

least   adversely  affected  our   commercial   and

industrial  activities. Our people then felt  quite

uneasy and had a sense of insecurity. Following the

formation  of the Vigilante Corps, such  activities

were on a reduced scale and the situation was later

put  under control. For these achievements  by  the

Vigilante Corps, we all should give them our praise

and   admiration.   I  understand   that   everyone

appreciates their efforts and contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Indonesian confrontation has become

history,  the Vigilante Corps' assistance is  still

necessary  at  the present juncture,  although  its

present duties may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



be  different. In the past their duty was mainly to

prevent  any  sabotage, to catch  spies  and  enemy

agents,  and  to protect the lives and property  of

our people. Today their task and responsibility  is

to  help  the  police maintain law  and  order  and

public security, and prevent anti-social activities

by anti-national elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After strict semi-military training, they will

become the pillars of our rugged society and become

model  citizens of our multi-racial  society.  Over

these  past several years the Vigilante  Corps  has

done  well to maintain public order and has  helped

the  Police  by  arresting robbers  and  protecting

women from being bullied by hooligans. In all these

activities they have shown that they are people  of

good  quality and imbued with a sense of sacrifice.

They  have set an example as good citizens for  all

to  see, and have maintained a very close and  good

relationship with community centres and the  people

of the various constituencies. Their high spirit of

service has given the public a good impression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps consist of people from

various  races  of  different  cultures,  different

streams  of  education,  different  languages   and

different religions. Their contribution in  uniting

the  people of various races together has  produced

results.  Their achievements have helped  to  unite

the  people.  In  my constituency,  Sembawang,  the

Vigilante  Corps unit consists of Chinese,  Indians

and  Malays.  The unit leader is an Indian.  He  is

able to unite the team together and has helped them

to  put up good achievements. This might be due  to

the  personal  capacity and  merits  of  this  unit

leader, but I believe another factor is that  there

is  already  being  formed a sort  of  identity  of

purpose. This will be a great contribution  to  our

task in building a multi-racial model society. This

is a very significant factor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the training of the Vigilante Corps

consists  mainly  of  drills  and  instruction   in

general police regulations. But I think they should

also be inculcated with a spirit of patriotism and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



loyalty to our country. This is also important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I have received complaints from members

of the Vigilante Corps. They say they have only one

uniform.  They  have to keep this clean  and  neat.

Because of this, I think they should be issued with

at least two uniforms. In my opinion, their request

is  very  reasonable, and I hope the Minister  will

consider it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill provides that the basic task of

the  Vigilante Corps is to help the police maintain

law  and  order,  to preserve public  security,  to

prevent   criminal  activities,   and   to   arrest

criminals, etc. At the same time, it also  provides

certain penalties against any members of the  Corps

who  commit  any  offences. Generally  speaking,  I

regard  this Bill as perfect and I hope that  after

its implemenation, the Vigilante Corps organisation

can  be further perfected and strengthened and grow

from strength to strength, making it more effective

in  the  preservation of our social  order  and  in

carrying out their task in serving the country  and

protecting the lives and property of our people.



<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, the purpose of this Bill,

as explained by the Minister of Defence, is to make

statutory  provisions  for  the  establishment  and

maintenance of the Vigilante Corps in our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the Vigilante Corps existed as a

local  voluntary organisation formed by some civic-

minded  citizens who saw the need  of  a  vigilante

organisation  to  assist the police  in  preserving

peace  and order in their own areas. Later,  during

the  confrontation days, our Deputy Prime  Minister

realised the important role of the Vigilante  Corps

and appealed to the public to join the Corps. After

that  there  was  enthusiastic  response  from  the

public, and the Vigilante Corps was set up both  in

the   rural  and  urban  areas  of  Singapore.  The

Vigilante Corps then began to grow to their present

strength  with the support, of course,  of  various

community leaders. As a matter of fact, our  Deputy

Prime Minister went



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



to  some  constituencies  to  visit  the  Vigilante

Corps.  In some of the constituencies which  border

the  sea,  the  Vigilante Corps  also  did  coastal

patrol duties until well past midnight to help  the

police  watch  for illegal entry of  saboteurs  and

agents.  In  fact,  the  Vigilante  Corps  made   a

tremendous   contribution  towards   the   internal

security of Singapore during confrontation days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to avail myself of this

opportunity  to ask this House to place  on  record

the  appreciation of our Government to  members  of

the Vigilante Corps for their voluntary services in

maintaining  the peace and security of our  country

during confrontation days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present circumstances have necessitated the

enlargement of the Vigilante Corps so as to take in

national  servicemen who will do  their  part-time

service in the Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to enact laws to make the Vigilante

Corps  a statutory organisation, therefore,  cannot

be disputed in this House. All hon. Members of this

House,  I am sure, will give their support to  this

Bill.  However,  there  is one  point  I  wish  the

Minister to consider, that is, the welfare  of  the

Vigilante Corps members. I notice in clause  24  of

this  Bill  that  the  Minister  makes  regulations

concerning the administration, discipline, training

and  welfare of the Corps. I am happy to note  that

there  are  provisions  in  this  section  to  make

regulations  on  the  awards  of  compensation   in

respect  of death and personal injuries, awards  of

pensions  and  gratuities  and  reimbursements   of

payments  to  members of the Vigilante  Corps.  But

there  should  be  provision also  to  provide  for

medical   care  and  attention  not  arising   from

injuries. Can the Minister clarify the question  of

reimbursements  and  payments  to  members  of  the

Corps? Does he mean that a travelling allowance  at

the  same rate as that paid to the P.D.F. will  be

paid  to  Corps members who turn out  for  duty  or

training? Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br>4.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

all those people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



who   are  concerned  with  security  and  who  pay

attention  to  current affairs will agree  with  me

that  the economy of a nation is a basic factor  in

contributing towards its stability. Our people work

very   hard  in  contributing  towards  Singapore's

economic  stability.  So if they  work  harder  and

serve   society  in  general  and  the  nation   in

particular, then everybody should have a  sense  of

security  and  a  strong  sense  of  patriotism.  I

believe  the  majority of the people  in  Singapore

fully  understand that their fate is closely linked

with that of the nation, and that their future  too

is  closely related to the future of Singapore.  So

their love of Singapore is absolute and beyond  any

doubt. The question is, how is the Government going

to  preserve  the  peace  of  this  country  in   a

turbulent region, to instil a sense of security  in

a  sea of trouble in this region? So it is for  the

Government  to come out with definite  policies  to

show us how we can do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of regular armed forces for

national  defence  is the usual method  adopted  by

other  countries,  but it is not  applicable  in  a

small  island  State like Singapore. In  the  first

place,    we    cannot   shoulder   the   financial

responsibilities  of maintaining  a  large  regular

army.  Secondly, its existence may give rise  to  a

possible    military    take-over    or    military

dictatorship.  In the Afro-Asian countries  and  in

the  South  American countries, we find  a  lot  of

instances of a military dictatorship as a result of

a  large standing army. Although they have standing

armies, they are without a closely-knit society. In

South Vietnam there are about half a million strong

regular  forces,  but in spite of  this,  there  is

still turbulence and trouble there. South Korea has

an  army of about 600,000 strong, but there is also

trouble there. This is because of their lack of  an

organised  and  a  closely-knit  society.  In   the

Philippines,  too, there is a strong army,  but  in

spite  of  that,  there is trouble,  and  there  is

smuggling and robbery throughout the country.  This

is   because   the  people  are  poorly  organised.

Indonesia  has  an army of about  400,000,  but  in

spite of that, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



trouble and disorder there. In other countries even

where they have strong armies, military coups  take

place.  All this is due to the lack of organisation

and a closely-knit society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we can successfully organise our people,

that, I think, is the best method to defend our own

country.  This is because, in the first  place,  we

can  do away with the necessity to maintain a large

army.  Secondly,  we can bring up a  generation  of

people   who  will  be  nationally  conscious   and

patriotic  and  well organised to  maintain  social

order  and national security. I am glad, therefore,

that  the  Government is not just shouting  slogans

but is carrying out in a practical way whatever  it

has  promised. It is an effective Government  which

means what it says and says what it means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official establishment of the Vigilante Corps

is  another instance to show that the Government is

always  concerned with the security of  the  people

and  the maintenance of an orderly society. We were

threatened with communal disturbances in the  past,

but  we do not gloat over the disturbances and  the

misfortunes of others. In troubled times we had  to

set  up a Vigilante Corps in order to smash up  the

intrigues of our enemies who wished to disrupt  our

social  order and, at the same time, to  unite  our

people so that the various races in Singapore could

understand the importance of racial harmony in  the

State.  Now this painful event in history is  past,

but  the fact remains that the contributions of the

Vigilante Corps are still fresh in the minds of the

people.  Now  that  Singapore  is  independent  and

sovereign,   people  of  all  races  must   further

understand  that  the Vigilante  Corps,  their  own

organisation,   must  continue  to   maintain   the

integrity of our country and to preserve  order  in

our  society. It is the responsibility and duty  of

every citizen to take part in this great task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a saying that to build a strong

country   we  must  build  a  strong  people.   The

Government of the country, in officially setting up

the Vigilante Corps, and in giving legal status  to

it,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



is  going  one  step further to  show  that  it  is

desirous  of building a strong people in  order  to

defend  our  own  country and  to  maintain  social

order. It is an enlightened policy and a very  wise

step  to take. If necessary, we shall turn all  our

people  into soldiers. This is a test of our people

to  see  whether  they  have  this  spirit.  As   a

representative  of the people and  as  a  Singapore

citizen, I am proud of the step being taken  and  I

am honoured to associate myself with this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I think all of us in this

House  are  very proud to associate ourselves  with

this Bill which has now turned out a very excellent

group  of  men  of various races and  from  various

walks of life into a legally constituted body. This

body, as I have said, came into being spontaneously

during  the  time when Singapore met  with  trouble

from  within  and without. By the passage  of  this

Bill  we  have  made  it  possible  for  our  young

national  servicemen  to  serve  in  the  Vigilante

Corps.  On the whole, I think there is no one  here

who can find any criticism of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take up some of the requests from Members of

the House with regard to the welfare of members  of

the Vigilante Corps and medical services, I do hope

and  I  feel  very  sure  that  among  the  medical

practitioners  in Singapore -and we  have  quite  a

large  number of them -there will be some who  will

be fired by the example of volunteer members of the

Vigilante Corps, i.e., in coming forward  to  offer

their services free of charge. I think that can  be

arranged.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to welfare, as the Member for

Mountbatten has pointed out, there is a  clause  in

the  Bill where the Minister has the discretion  or

the power to look into the welfare of the Vigilante

Corps members. And I can assure Members that I will

try  to do my best to see that their interests  are

well looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to pay, these are matters of

administrative detail, and once the mechanics of it

have been properly worked out, the details will  be

given  to members of the public and to hon. Members

who are interested.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like to ask a question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Teong, is it a point of

order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Can the

Minister  clarify what I have just  mentioned,  and

that  is  the complaint by certain members  of  the

Vigilante  Corps  that they have only  one  uniform

each?  Will he consider this complaint and  explain

to this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Teong, I am afraid your

question  is  out  of  order.  You  may  raise  the

question at the Committee stage if you wish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can the

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Development Fund Ordinance

(No.  52 of 1959) was enacted to allow the Minister

to  vire  funds from subhead to subhead;  the  only

limitation  being the amount available in  subheads

from  which  funds  are to be vired.  However,  the

Minister  does not have the power to create  a  new

subhead  even  when funds from other  subheads  are

available. This has resulted in unnecessary  delays

in the implementation of urgent projects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance has been in operation for the past

six  years  and,  in the light of this  experience,

certain amendments to the Ordinance are necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1967,

seeks to bring the Development Fund Ordinance  (No.

52  of  1959) in line with the Financial  Procedure

Act which was passed by Parliament in April 1966 to

empower the Minister to create new subheads and  to

transfer  any  surplus  arising  under  any   other

subhead  of  the  same  head  to  the  new  subhead

created; that is, it follows a similar procedure as

that  for  the ordinary Estimates. This is provided

for under clause 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of virements using savings from one

subhead to meet increased expenditure under another

subhead  may lead to slackness in planning projects

in the knowledge that there are savings to be vired

from   somewhere,   or  a  tendency   to   withhold

implementation of difficult projects on the  excuse

that  funds  for such projects are urgently  needed

elsewhere.  To discourage the use of  virements,  a

Contingencies Fund is provided to meet  any  urgent

and unforeseen need for expenditure on projects for

which  no  other  provision exists. Expenditure  on

urgent development projects for which there  is  no

provision  in  the  Development Estimates  will  be

charged  to  the Contingencies (Development)  Fund.

This  fund  will have to be replenished  each  year

with resources in the Development Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4 (6) of the Development Fund Ordinance,

1959,   which  disallows  the  issue  of   transfer

warrants  in  respect of a closed  financial  year,

will   also  be  deleted.  In  practice,   transfer

warrants  have  to  be  issued  to  regularise  the

Accountant-General's  accounts.  A  vote   may   be

exceeded  inadvertently or owing to wrong  entries.

Transfer  warrants  are required  to  rectify  such

errors  in  the new year in respect of accounts  of

the previous year so that the accounts can balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill deal with minor

miscellaneous amendments arising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



from Singapore's independent status,  such  as

deleting the words "Legislative Assembly" and  "the

Legislative Assembly" wherever they appear  therein

and substituting therefor the word "Parliament".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL RECORDS CENTRE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide a national

Archives  and  Records Centre for  Singapore  where

national  archival  services  providing   for   the

custody and preservation of Government archives and

records  of  high value and importance,  historical

research  as well as to the administration  can  be

undertaken.  The  care  and  maintenance  of  these

unique  documents  which  are  public  property  is

considered to be a public obligation and  has  been

enacted  into  legislation in several  Commonwealth

countries, including Ghana in 1955, New Zealand and

Nigeria in 1957, Tanzania and Sierra Leone in 1965,

and Malaysia in 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore archives, which comprise a

prominent  and  substantial  series  of  historical

documents,  some  dating as far back  as  1800  and

which  are part and parcel of Singapore's  national

heritage   providing  data,  facts  and  historical

information concerning the whole of South-East Asia

corresponding with the focal position of  Singapore

in  this region in the 19th and 20th centuries, are

at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



present  kept  in  the National  Library,  and  the

maintenance    of    these   documents    is    the

responsibility of the National Library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the growing production of records by

Government   departments,  statutory   boards   and

offices,  it has become necessary that overall  and

well-considered decisions should be  taken  on  the

difficult and recurrent question of disposal,  that

is,  what  records  to preserve, because  they  are

deemed to be of historical and national importance,

and  what records to destroy, which form by far the

larger part when no longer of use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is felt that the present system governed by

General  Orders Nos. 560 and 563 which  leave  this

important  decision  of  disposal  of  records   to

various  heads  of  departments and  administrative

offices   is   inadequate  in  that  no  consistent

principle  is  applied to the  disposal  of  public

records   which   may  result   in   the   possible

destruction of important public records and, at the

same  time, the preservation of those records which

are  of  no importance, thereby leading to loss  of

valuable space of Government and Board offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that post-war archives and records are

preserved  and added to our archival  holdings  for

further   reference  and  research,  it   will   be

necessary  for  adequate  repository  space  to  be

found.  This  is provided for in clause  3  of  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the determination of what part of public

records should be preserved and what part should be

disposed  of and for the direction, management  and

control  of  the  centre,  clause  4  of  the  Bill

empowers the Minister to appoint a Director for the

purpose.  It  is envisaged that the  Director  will

conduct  a  record management programme which  will

contribute  to  the  improvement of  administrative

efficiency    connected    with    the    creation,

utilisation,     maintenance,     retention     and

preservation  and  for  the  disposal   of   public

records,  thereby  ensuring  that  valuable  office

space now taken up by accumulation of non-recurrent

records in various Government and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



Board offices will be properly used. To enable  the

Director  to be advised on his functions, clause  5

of  the  Bill provides for the establishment  of  a

Committee appointed by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made in clause 9 of the Bill to

allow  for  the destruction or disposal  of  public

records only on authority of the Director.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made in clause 10 to allow persons

access  to only such public records as are regarded

as public archives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be moving in Committee a number of

amendments  to  the  Bill.  These  amendments   are

considered  necessary to enable the distinction  to

be made between archives and other public records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government   is   to   be  congratulated   on   the

introduction of this Bill which will help to remedy

the  long neglect of our unique historical archives

in  Singapore. I am glad the Government is bringing

in  amendments to provide for archives as well, for

archives are fundamentally different from a records

centre. The setting up of the National Archives and

Records  Centre  will  not only  be  of  tremendous

benefit to local and overseas scholars and research

workers  engaged  in studies into  the  history  of

Singapore, but also to those scholars and  research

workers  of neighbouring South-East Asian countries

as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the National Archives and Records

Centre   will   help   to  improve   administrative

efficiency   in   our  Government  departments   by

enabling  more office space to be used through  the

disposal  of unwanted Government records which  are

of no historical importance, and by ensuring a good

system  of  records  management which  will  reduce

paper  work,  enable files to be located  speedily,

and speed up Government actions in all spheres.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that early consideration be given

to  provide  a  suitable building for the  National

Archives  and  Records Centre in keeping  with  its

status as the repository of the nation's history. I

understand the old records are at present  kept  in

the  National  Library  and the  removal  of  these

records   from  the  National  Library  will   also

alleviate  the  burden  of space  in  the  National

Library brought about by the unprecedented increase

in library services to the public over the last few

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be hoped that with the establishment of

the  National  Archives  and  Records  Centre,   an

adequate  budget  for staff and  services  will  be

provided  to  ensure that this new department  will

not  be hampered in its first year of existence and

that  there  will  also be provision  for  training

future staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Just for the information of the

Member,  Sir,  the  question  of  the  budget   and

training   facilities   will   be   considered.   I

understand  it is in the hands of the  Ministry  of

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Inche Othman Wok].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 3, after "National", to insert

"Archives and".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of amending the Short Title of the

Bill   from  "National  Records  Centre   Act"   to

"National  Archives  and  Records  Centre  Act"  is

because  the term "public archives" has a  distinct

meaning from "public records". In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



clause  2  of the Bill "public archives"  has  been

defined  to  mean  public records of  national  and

historical value which are more than 25 years  old,

and  therefore, the Act which establishes a  centre

to  house public archives and public records should

be  known  as  the "National Archives  and  Records

Centre  Act". The need to amend the Short Title  of

the  Bill has been made after consultation with the

UNESCO  expert on archives who has helped to  draft

the present Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) have been transferred to the Centre or to

such other place as the Director may from time to

time determine;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason for introducing this

additional clause is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



it is necessary that public records of more than 25

years  old  and of enduring national and historical

value   should  be  transferred  to   an   archival

institution   responsible  for   establishing   and

maintaining  their custodial integrity before  they

are regarded as public archives.

"Committee"   means   the  Archives   and   Records

of  the  need to transfer to the Centre all records

before they become archives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is felt necessary that

prohibition  should  be  made  not  only  for   the

unauthorised  taking out and export of  any  public

records   but  also  to  prevent  the  damage   and

destruction of public records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>UNDESIRABLE ACTIVITIES OF CERTAIN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN-ORIENTATED ORGANISATIONS IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

our Republic of Singapore has a multi-racial, multi-

religious  and multi-lingual society. It  does  not

belong  to any particular race. The Government  has

given  full freedom to the various groups of people

in  Singapore  to  exercise their  own  rights  and

principles  in the broad context of a  multi-racial

society, for example, freedom of speech, freedom of

religion and freedom of association. Time and again

our  Ministers have spoken to the people  on  these

matters  and  reminded  them  of  the  duties   and

responsibilities towards society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that all registered

organisations  in Singapore should have  faith  and

interest  in  our country and work for our  people.

But   there  are  some  organisations  who,  though

registered  in  Singapore,  have  their  loyalties,

directly  or  indirectly,  somewhere  else  outside

Singapore. They have more connections with  foreign

countries. Their activities show that they are more

interested in the people and organisations  outside

this  country. Sir, I have in my mind the Singapore

Dravida   Munnetra  Kazhagam,  in  short,   D.M.K.,

registered in Singapore under the Societies Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



Even  though this society claims to look after  the

interest  of  the  people of  Singapore,  there  is

evidence to show that this organisation has, in all

respects,  connections with the D.M.K, in  Madras.

For  example, the society bears the exact  name  of

the  political  party in power in Madras  State  of

India,  the  D.M.K.,  except for  the  addition  of

Singapore before its name. Its symbol is the rising

sun  which  is the same as that of the D.M.K.,  the

political party of a foreign State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present set-up of our country is not in

favour of having one language or one religion. That

is  why  we  are  preaching and  practising  multi-

lingualism and multi-religion. There are  societies

formed   on  the  basis  of  different  races   and

religions,  but  they all work for one  nation  and

that  is Singapore. We can have many cultures, many

religions  and  many  languages.  But  our   nation

-nationhood should be one. We may be diversified in

language and religion - but we should have unity and

oneness in loyalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote from the Mirror of

Opinion,  a publication of the Ministry of Culture,

dated 24th August, 1967, page 10. Under the heading

Tamil Press appears a translation of the speech  by

the  General Secretary of the Singapore  D.M.K. at

the  dinner  given to Mr Manoharan,  a  leader  of

Madras  D.M.K. and an Indian Member of  Parliament,

by  the Singapore D.M.K. on Sunday, 20th August. He

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Manoharan's visit (incidentally, this visit

of  Mr Manoharan was the second one within  a  few

years, at the invitation of the Singapore  D.M.K.)

has  given  life  and  strength  to  the  Singapore D.M.K.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to bring to the attention

of  the  House another passage from page 2  of  the

Mirror  of Opinion, dated 23rd August, 1967,  under

the  same heading. The Indian Parliamentary  Member

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First you must have faith in yourself. Have

faith  in Tamil. If it is true that you have  faith

in  Tamil, have faith in us. If you have  faith  in

us, then you, should have faith in Anna (Mr C.  N.

Annadurai, Chief Minister of Madras) who  is  above

everything.  If  you  develop  these  faiths,  your

future will never be bleak.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was said at the 9th anniversary celebrations

of the Kampong Bahru Branch of the Singapore D.M.K.

on  19th  August, 1967. Mr Speaker, Sir,  "in  us"

means not in our leaders or our Ministers, but  "in

them", in the foreign leaders and Ministers.  These

two quotations, few of the many, will bear evidence

that  the  Singapore D.M.K, really has  connections

with  the  D.M.K. in Madras. But the  local  D.M.K.

has,  time  and again, denied any connections  with

the  Madras  D.M.K.  Sir, I quote  again  from  the

Mirror  of Opinion dated 2nd August, 1967. This  is

on page 2, paragraph 7:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Since the Singapore D.M.K. has categorically

denied  having any links with the D.M.K. of Madras,

the English and Tamil news announcements over Radio

on   July  30,  as  "this  Kural  Conference  being

sponsored  by  the Singapore branch of  the  ruling

Dravida  Munnetra  Kazhagam of  Madras  State"  are

wrong  - Reader's  letter under  "Flower  and  Thorn"

column. (MALAR).'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I doubt this statement of the local

D.M.K. since  their  actions do  not  prove  their

words.  Here  is a copy of "KOLGAI MUZHAKKAM"  -the

organ of the Singapore D.M.K. In every issue,  more

than half of the pages are devoted to printing  the

speeches of Mr C. N. Annadurai and his colleagues.

The  organ  symbolises the photo of Mr  Annadurai.

From this alone, I am sure the Members of the House

may   find  the  truth  of  the  statement  of  the

Singapore  D.M.K. denying links  with  the  Madras D.M.K.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look into the functions organised by

the  Singapore D.M.K. All the functions are  graced

by  the  presence  of one or more  leaders  of  the

Madras  D.M.K.  But the organisers are  careful  to

invite local leaders too. And on one such occasion,

the   Minister   for  Foreign   Affairs,   Mr   S.

Rajaratnam,  at a meeting held on 29th July,  1967,

at  the Conference Hall, had advised the Indians in

Singapore:  "Think of Singapore first  and  others

secondary, and Tamils in Singapore should not think

of  themselves  only but to care  for  the  general

interest  of  the  people of  Singapore."  And  the

Minister for Social Affairs at a meeting of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



Singapore D.M.K. Pasir Panjang Branch reminded  the

members to co-operate with the Government. This  is

reported  on page 1 of the Mirror of Opinion  dated

19th  August, 1967. But I am doubtful how  many  of

the Singapore D.M.K. members took this advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the functions makes us look into

the  financial side of this organisation. They have

collected a fairly large amount towards a  building

fund.  But to date I do not know what has  happened

to  this money. Seldom was there a function without

a  leader from Madras, and they spend big sums  for

their  visits.  The  highlight  was  in  1965.   An

official of the local D.M.K. was sent to Madras  to

invite a prominent member of the Madras D.M.K. and

make  other arrangements for his visit. In addition

to  the passage-fare of this official, another $500

was  paid to him for pocket expenses. And  for  the

visit  of  the  Madras leader itself,  a  total  of

$34,658.92  was  spent. The air  passage  for  this

leader  and  one of his colleagues came to  $5,369.

Here I wish to mention that even a first-class  air

passage for Madras-Singapore-Madras would cost only

$2,204  for  two persons. I leave the rest  to  the

Members.  And  again,  gifts worth  $4,118.10  were

given to the visitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am informed that a few members of the

Singapore  D.M.K.,  who were  unhappy  about  these

expenses, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister with

a copy to the Registrar of Societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have given a list of items. I

can  quote  numerous instances to  prove  that  the

Singapore D.M.K, is foreign-orientated and that it

is   spending  money  not  for  the  interests   of

Singaporeans.  But I do not wish  to  take  up  the

precious  time  of the House since I  think  a  few

examples  will do. In view of the present situation

and  as we have reached the limits of our patience,

I  request  the Minister to look into the  accounts

and  activities of the said organisation  and  take

the necessary action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

D.M.K, is an organisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



registered  as  a  cultural  organisation  and   is

therefore  prohibited  from  taking  part  in   any

political activities. I do not know the composition

of  its  members. Probably there are some who  have

just  obtained Singapore citizenship and there  may

be   some  who  are  not  local  citizens  as  yet.

Therefore,  perhaps there is a tendency  for  these

people to be orientated outwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a democratic society and we believe more

in the art of persuasion and example rather than by

using  force.  We believe that by our  example  and

through persuasion we can make the immigrant  races

in  Singapore  come  to realise that  Singapore  is

their  home  and that their loyalty  lies  here.  I

think  this must have been in the minds of both  my

colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  when

he  addressed the D.M.K. and advised them to  think

of  Singapore  first, and the Minister  for  Social

Affairs,  who  at  one of their functions  strongly

urged   that  they  should  co-operate   with   the

Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the enthusiastic

response  of  the people of Singapore  to  national

service  and  the  present  spirit  prevailing   in

Singapore will make whatever organisation there  is

realise  soon  that  if  they  are  not  Singapore-

orientated  but foreign-orientated,  they  will  be

going  against national sentiment and the  national

spirit  and  that it will not pay them to  continue

doing so. I expect that, given time, the members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



of  the  D.M.K. will probably be infected with  the

spirit of nationalism that is to be seen among  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Member for Aljunied has brought up in

this  House,  however,  is quite  disturbing,  that

there  seems to be a very clear connection  between

the  D.M.K. here and the D.M.K. in Madras and  that

probably  they  have  been indulging  in  political

activities.  However, I would like  to  assure  him

that  a strong reminder will be sent to the office-bearers  of  the D.M.K. to the effect  that,  as  a cultural  organisation, they are not to participate

in  any political activities, local or foreign, and

that  if  they  do  so, they will infringe  on  the

Societies   Act   and  will  have   to   bear   the

consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point that the hon.

Member has raised, the alleged misuse of funds will

have  to be left to the members of the organisation

themselves, but I can assure him that I  will  look

very  closely  into the question  of  the  D.M.K.'s

symbol  and activities and will watch what they  do

in future with a hawk-like eye.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>
