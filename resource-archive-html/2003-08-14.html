<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Acting Minister

for  Manpower (a) if he will explain (i) how the  9  in  10

jobs  going to resident workforce is derived, (ii)  whether

there is any difference in this ratio across



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>



the various major sectors of the economy, and (iii) how has

this  ratio changed since 1996; and (b) will the Government

consider  introducing measures such as  those  in  the  US,

where  an employer can hire a foreigner only after  he  has

failed in his attempt to employ a local.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Acting Minister

for  Manpower in view of his comments in the press,  if  he

will  (i)  clarify  his comments that foreign  workers  are

being  used  to moderate the wages of Singaporean  workers;

(ii) state what are the 'other national objectives' that he

is  referring  to;  (iii) explain how will the  release  of

specific  employment data compromise our national  interest

and  these objectives; and (iv)  release the statistics  to

substantiate the claims of his Ministry that 9  out  of  10

jobs created in the last 5 years went to Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  with your permission,  I  propose  to  take

Question Nos 1 and 2 after Question Time in the form  of  a

Ministerial Statement.  This is to allow other questions to

be  answered as well as to allow ample time for Members  to

ask questions after my reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. We will proceed to the other

Questions then.

<div align="center"><b>STANDARD OF LIVING</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Ms Irene

Ng Phek Hoong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry

whether (i) the ongoing wage reform and wage cuts will mean

that  Singaporeans will see their standard of living  going

down  over  the next few years, and (ii) the Government  is

taking active measures to keep the cost of living down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Question No. 3,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our standard of living in

Singapore will have to adjust to a level which makes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>



our  companies  and  our  economy  competitive.   Wages  in

Singapore are currently under pressure because of  cyclical

and structural reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cyclical front, the weakness of the global

economy  and SARS have led to the poor performance  of  our

economy  since 2001.  The second quarter of this  year  was

particularly  bad,  aggravated by the  uncertainty  of  the

Iraqi War.  However, with the war over and SARS behind  us,

for  the time being at least, our economy is likely  to  be

better  in the second half. The US economy is also  showing

signs  of recovery with a better than expected 2.4%  growth

in  the  second  quarter.  Many analysts  believe  that  US

growth  in  the  second half could be even  stronger.   Our

forecast  of  0 - 1% growth for this year implies  that  we

expect our economy to grow by 1.3 - 3.3% in the second half

of the year, compared to a contraction of 1.3% in the first

half.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our economy may improve in the coming months, we

face  serious longer-term structural challenges.  The entry

of  China,  India,  Vietnam and other  countries  into  the

global market place means that the wages of many workers in

Singapore  will come under strong downward pressure.   This

pressure is across the board because of the large number of

skilled  workers, technicians, engineers,  programmers  and

others from these countries who are prepared to do the same

work  for much less money. Outsourcing has resulted  in  an

increasingly globalised labour market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, skill for skill, job for job, our workers and

professionals do command a significant premium  over  their

competitors  in  other countries because of our  reputation

for   quality  and  reliability,  and  the  efficiency  and

integrity  of  the  system  that  we  have.  The  Singapore

reputation  enhances the value of all Singaporeans  in  the

global  marketplace. Hence, we continue  to  attract  large

investments  in the manufacturing sectors like electronics,

engineering,  petrochemicals and the  biomedical  sciences,

and  in  the services sectors like the financial  industry,

tourism and logistics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Singapore premium is finite. Beyond a point,

we  are  not  worth the premium and, if our wages  are  too

high,  the  investments  will flow  elsewhere  instead,  as

indeed  is  already  happening  in  some  sectors.  It   is

therefore very important for us to watch our costs,  labour

being  a  key component of total cost. We have to make  our

wage   structure  more  flexible.   It  has  to   be   more

performance-based   (less   seniority-based),   and    more

responsive  to changes in business conditions. The  way  to

reduce   adjustment   pains  is  to  allow   for   frequent

adjustments in our wage structure and, more importantly, in

our  thinking.  This  is the way for  us  to  maintain  our

competitiveness  and  safeguard  our  jobs  in  a   rapidly

changing  global economy.  If we do not adjust our standard

of  living to stay competitive, the market will force it on

us  in a more painful way through the outflow of investment

and retrenchment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cost of living in Singapore, it has remained

relatively stable in recent years. Between 1997 - 2002, the

Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen by only 0.6% per year,

and  in  fact fell 0.4% last year.  The Government monitors

this index closely.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, with the wage

reforms  that  are on-going, the basic pay of  our  workers

will be cut.  Is MTI monitoring how this might affect those

with huge commitments in housing, children's education  and

car loans?



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Various Government agencies

are  looking at how some of these adjustments can  be  made

less  painful.  The Government will always make  sure  that

every  citizen  has  a  shelter over  his  head,  there  is

adequate  basic health care and the education of the  young

is  properly  looked after.  But beyond  that,  adjustments

will be necessary and some of them will be painful.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, while it is true that

cost  of  living  has been quite stable, Singaporeans  feel

that  certain  components of it need to be  monitored  more

closely,  such as transport.  I wonder whether the Minister

would consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>



setting  up  a committee just to look at how we  can  bring

transport costs down.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I believe we already

have  mechanisms to monitor the changes in transport  costs

to   ensure   that  they  are  reasonable,  justified   and

affordable.

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYED SINGAPOREANS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  with the hope of foreign investments  flowing  to

Singapore's manufacturing and services sector and  creating

between 12,000 and 15,000 new jobs (a) how and in what form

will  the  economic restructuring be; (b) how will  jobless

Singaporeans be trained and assisted for gainful employment

opportunities in these newly created jobs; (c) what will be

the  likely duration for the Singaporean unemployed  to  be

ready  for such gainful employment opportunities  in  these

newly  created  jobs;  (d)  of  the  unemployed,  how  many

constitute   those   released   from   prisons   and   drug

rehabilitation  centres; (e) how are these  unemployed  ex-criminals  and  drug  offenders  being  assisted  to   gain

employment without being prejudiced by employers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mdm Ho Geok Choo has asked a

somewhat   comprehensive  Question   which   covers   three

Ministries  -  mine, the Ministry of Home Affairs  and  the

Ministry  of Manpower.  I have been given the privilege  to

give the initial response to her.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On economic restructuring, with rising competition and

technological changes, we need to restructure  our  economy

in  two  main ways. First, we need to shift towards a  more

flexible   and  competitive  cost  structure.  This   means

reforming  our  wage  structure to be  more  responsive  to

changes  in  business  conditions, and  re-tuning  our  CPF

system  to  reduce statutory burden on employers.  We  must

also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>



lower   direct  taxes,  and  price  our  land   and   other

infrastructure services competitively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need to shift towards higher value-added,

knowledge-based  activities.  This  means  moving  up   the

manufacturing value chain, growing exportable services, and

upgrading  our domestic services sector. Of the  12,000  to

15,000 new jobs that EDB will bring in this year, more than

85% will require skilled workers. We must therefore upgrade

the  capabilities  of  our  work force,  and  re-skill  our

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will turn to assistance and training for

unemployed  Singaporeans.   Under  its  Place   and   Train

programme,  the  Manpower  Ministry   works  with  industry

partners  to  first  place job seekers with  a  prospective

employer, before sending them for training. This is  better

than  the train-then-place approach as it minimises wastage

in  training. MOM will work with EDB and employers to match

job   seekers  with  new  jobs  created,  and  provide  the

necessary training to equip them with the right skills  and

knowledge.  Payroll-support for training will  be  provided

through the Skills Redevelopment Fund (SRF).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on employment and rehabilitation of ex-criminals, we do not track the proportion of unemployed who

are  ex-prisoners  or  released  from  Drug  Rehabilitation

Centres  (DRCs).   Every  year,  there  are  about   11,000

offenders released from prisons and DRCs.  In the first six

months  of  this  year,  more than  900  ex-offenders  have

approached  the  Singapore  Corporation  of  Rehabilitative

Enterprises  (SCORE) to seek assistance in  securing  jobs.

Of   these,   39%  were  successfully  placed  in   gainful

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offenders are prepared for gainful employment while

they  are  still in prison and DRCs.  SCORE  provides  them

with  vocational training in various skills  such  as  food

preparation,  metal  work and electronics.  Employers  also

participate in training sponsorship and offering  jobs.  In

2001, the Prisons Department embarked on a public education

campaign  to  counter prejudices in employing ex-offenders.

Earlier this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>



year,  SCORE and a local company produced a movie `Twilight

Kitchen' which traces the struggle of an ex-offender trying

to  gain  acceptance at his work place.  The movie will  be

screened  to  grassroots organisations  to  create  greater

awareness  on  the  role  that the community  can  play  in

reintegrating ex-offenders.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in view of our

economic  restructuring, how do we intend to actually  grow

those  sectors that will be our cash cows?   As  for  those

sectors  that we would not be doing well in, what  are  our

plans going forward?  Would we be eliminating these sectors

and,  if  so,  how  should we relocate employees  in  these

sectors?



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> There are three key

thrusts in the strategy going ahead.  One is that we intend

to  expand  our external ties and that is why we  have  the

free trade agreements and the informal people networks that

we have launched.  This is one of the key thrusts, which is

basically to have a globalised economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thrust is to create an entrepreneurial

economy  and  this is to create Singapore as  a  source  of

enterprise  itself  -  a  market  for  talents,  ideas  and

capital.   Finally,  a  diversified economy  that,  besides

manufacturing, the other pillar of growth will be  services

and  we  will expand these services not just to  strengthen

our  traditional areas of strength like logistics,  finance

or  tourism but in new areas, such as healthcare, education

and the creative industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the broad strategy. How it actually shapes

up,  I  think  we  will  have to  let  the  market  decide,

including  the  movement  of labour  and  people  into  the

different industries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Can I just ask the

Minister  whether he thinks that Singapore can  effectively

compete in the manufacturing sector in the coming years  in

the  light of the competition that we face from India  and,

particularly, China, with their cheaper source of labour?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> I am quite confident that

we  will be able to compete.  What is important is that  we

ensure that the economy as a whole is cost-competitive  and

what   is  important  in  terms  of  competition  for   the

investment dollar is really the total package.  It  is  not

just  a  question of absolute cost but, at the end  of  the

day,  it  is  really  output  per  unit  of  cost  that  is

important.   It  is  for  this reason  that  Singapore  has

managed to continue to hold its own in the contest for  the

investment  dollar.   Last year, we  brought  in  about  $9

billion  in  fixed  asset manufacturing  investment.   This

year,  as  the Prime Minister has announced in his National

Day message, we are looking at about $7.5 billion.  We will

continue  to  get major investments into Singapore.   So  I

think it is the totality.  Cost is an important factor  but

there  are  other  attributes that bring  investments  into

Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE SCHEMES FOR LOCAL ENTERPRISES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reduction of grants)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what  are  the reasons for reducing  the  various

grants such as Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme

(LETAS),  Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) and  Micro

Loan Programme (MLP) when the need for such schemes is even

more pressing in view of our present economic climate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Sir, SPRING Singapore reviews and

calibrates its various SME assistance schemes from time  to

time   to   ensure  optimal  use  and  effectiveness.   The

Government's co-funding share for LETAS was raised from 50%

to  70% for first-time applicants in October 1999, and  for

the   National  Cost  of  Quality  and  Financial   Advisor

programmes  in  November 2001. The intent  was  to  promote

awareness of SMEs on LETAS and these two programmes. As the

objective has since been met - for instance, the number  of

first-time  applicants for LETAS doubled from 1,500  in  FY

1999  to 3,000 in FY 2002 - the co-funding share for  these

categories has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>



reverted  to the normal 50% in July 2003. This  will  allow

the  pool of LETAS funds to support more SME upgrading  and

new programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these modifications to LETAS, there are no

changes  to  either  the  Local Enterprise  Finance  Scheme

(LEFS)  or the Micro Loan Programme.  In fact, during  this

economic  slowdown,  LEFS  has  been  enhanced  twice,   in

November 2001 and June 2003, and both in terms of moving it

up so that more medium enterprises, and down to the smaller

companies,  would qualify for LEFS.   I wish to  assure  Dr

Neo  that  the  Government is aware of  the  importance  of

helping  SMEs in these challenging times.  We are  in  fact

looking into expanding the Loan Insurance Scheme (LIS)  and

the  Bridging Loan Programme to benefit more SMEs.  Details

will be announced when ready.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister of

State  whether reducing the quantum for LETAS in fact  runs

counter  to  the bigger picture of the need to  revive  our

economy and to increase entrepreneurship?  Should there not

be   priority  given  to  assist  local  businesses,   with

concerted  efforts  by  various  Ministries,  rather   than

cutting back?



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> LETAS was, right from the

start,  a  co-funding  scheme,  and  it  was  50%  by   the

Government  and  50%  by the company itself.   This  is  to

ensure commitment.  As I have explained, the reason why  we

went  up to 70% was for a particular period of time,  which

is  promotional.  The issue here is really to get  SMEs  to

upgrade their capabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that the hon. Member brought up is

really  a matter of how best to help SMEs when it comes  to

cash-flow financing.  That is the difficulty we have in  an

economic  downturn  -  not  just a  question  of  upgrading

capabilities, but how do we help them so that  a  liquidity

problem does not turn into an insolvency problem.  And here

there is actually a whole range of schemes that has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>



launched by the Government and which is still in existence.

As I said, LEFS is one scheme where you can actually tap on

it  for  working  capital.  The Micro Loan Scheme  actually

helps  very small companies to tide over difficult  periods

where they are tight in their cash flow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bridging Loan Programme, which was introduced

during  the  SARS outbreak and which is still in operation,

seeks  again  to help companies who are particularly  badly

affected  during the SARS outbreak in terms of their  cashflow requirements.  So there is a whole range of schemes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether

his  Ministry  has been stringent in approving applications

under  the  various schemes, such as LETAS, LEFS  and  MLP?

What are the approval rates for such schemes?  Is there too

much  red tape associated with these schemes?  Am I correct

to  say  that LETAS application is cumbersome, requiring  a

lot  of  information and difficult ones, such as the impact

of  the  project  on  the company's future  operations  and

business?



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Actually that is not a

difficult question.  If I were to give you money,  I  would

like to know what are your company's plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Government too stringent in approving

applications  under  LEFS, LETAS  and  MLP?   I  think  our

philosophy must be that at the end of the day to use market

mechanism to decide, because funds are finite and  we  will

have  to find a way to allocate the funds to those who  are

most  deserving  of help.  The way we have gone  around  is

basically to use financial players who are already  in  the

industry,  rather  than  for the Government  to  substitute

itself for the financial players.  So, in the case of LEFS,

for   instance,   we   have   17  participating   financial

institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the Government help? The Government helps by

providing  the credit line.  The problem for  SMEs  is  the

perception  by industry players that the risks are  higher.

By  providing the credit line, the Government  is  actually

lowering  the  risks  for  the  financial  player  that  is

actually



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>



awarding  a particular loan.  So, the Government takes  80%

of the risks and the financial industry player takes 20%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue here is in terms of expertise. Does

the  particular  financial institution understand  the  SME

business well enough in order to assess it and give out the

loan?   Increasingly,  the market will  have  players  that

specialise in SMEs financing.  For instance, recently, OCBC

Bank  has announced that it is going into partnership  with

Hong Kong SME Loan, which specialises in cash-flow lending,

which  is important for SMEs.  Hong Leong Finance  is  also

positioning  itself as a SME bank to help them.   So,  that

must be the approach.  The Government should not substitute

itself  for existing financial players, because that  would

be crowding them out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I think the

Minister  of State missed the point that Dr Neo was  trying

to  get  at.  Is it not possible to simplify the procedures

when  applying  for such grants?  One of  the  most  common

complaints  among  the SMEs when applying  for  the  grants

under the schemes is the number of forms and questions that

they  have  to answer, bearing in mind that many  of  these

companies do not have professional backup.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I would like to pose is that in

submitting their business plans, many of these SMEs have to

engage  consultants.   I  understand  that  previously  the

consultancy fees were heavily subsidised.  Am  I  right  to

say that the consultancy fees are no longer subsidised,  or

has the subsidy been significantly reduced and, if so, why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> The short answer to the

question  whether  or not there is too much  administrative

hassle in applying for a loan is that if that is the  case,

give me the details and we will look into them.  Our aim is

to  facilitate.  The fact of the matter is that there  have

been  a  lot of loans that have been approved.  But if,  at

the margin, there are excessive rules that you think we can

cut down, the answer is yes, we will look into them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of the consultancy fees, there is still

subsidy  for  the  consultancy  fees.   As  to  the  actual

quantum,  I do not have the details here, but I could  give

them to the hon. Member separately.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether

these  various schemes are well publicised and targeted  at

those  who may benefit most, and whether he would  consider

promoting  these schemes further to increase their  take-up

rate so that we can help more SMEs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> The schemes are actually

pretty well publicised.  All the chambers of commerce,  for

instance,  are  fully  aware  of  these  schemes;  business

associations, whether it be the Association  of  Small  and

Medium  Enterprises, the chambers of commerce - we actually

have  satellite  centres  in  some  of  these  chambers  of

commerce to try to promote these schemes, so that they have

a better understanding of the schemes.  If the Member feels

that more can be done, let us know and we will see how best

to do so.

<div align="center"><b>RETRENCHED AND UNEMPLOYED HOME-OWNERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Interim financial assistance schemes)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Community  Development and Sports if there are any  interim

financial  assistance  schemes available  to  the  recently

retrenched or unemployed home-owners to sustain them for  a

longer period as they use up their savings.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Ms

Braema  will  be  pleased to know that we have  schemes  in

place   to  help  the  retrenched  or  unemployed  workers,

particularly those from the lower income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such scheme is the Interim Short-term Financial

Assistance Scheme (IFAS) that provides temporary relief  to

tide the families over a difficult period, such as a crisis

or unemployment.  This scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>



is  currently  administered  by the  Community  Development

Councils.   Assistance is given for  three  months  in  the

first instance, and may be renewed for another three months

should the family circumstances justify further assistance.

IFAS  has also helped families in purchased flats who  face

temporary   difficulties  in  paying  for   their   current

utilities  and  conservancy charges.  There  is  also  help

given  to  schooling  children for their  school  expenses.

This  is  over  and  above what the  schools  provide.   In

financial  year 2002, about 6,700 cases were  approved  for

short-term assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above, the Citizens' Consultative

Committees (CCCs) do offer assistance to residents who  are

facing financial hardship.  Food rations, bursaries and, in

some cases, direct financial assistance, have been given by

CCCs to residents in need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are also several financial

assistance  measures  to  help  HDB  mortgagors  who   face

financial  hardship  arising from a reduction  or  loss  of

income  due to wage cuts, retrenchment or business failure.

These include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Conversion to a reduced repayment scheme, under

which a mortgagor can pay between 50% and 75% of the normal

loan instalment;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Deferment of payment of loan instalments for six

months;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Extension of loan repayment period;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Inclusion of other working family members as

joint owners; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Payment of loan arrears by instalments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgagors who have difficulty servicing their

mortgage  loan  can  approach their HDB Branch  Office  for

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of self-help is an important one.

Beneficiaries  must make an effort to  get  on  their  feet

again.   Displaced workers have to re-orientate  themselves

to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>



new economic realities and take advantage of the help given

to  improve  their  situation through  retraining  and  job

placement services.



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask

the  Minister,  in  the  light of the current  unemployment

situation,  what would be the criteria that would  be  used

under  the  Interim Short-term Financial Assistance  Scheme

when six months are up and there are still difficulties  in

securing a job?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> On the ground, we

have left the implementation of the IFAS to the CDCs.   Not

all  CDCs  will operate the scheme uniformly.   There  have

been cases where those who have exceeded the six months are

evaluated  on  a  case-by-case  basis.   Our  assurance  to

Singaporeans is that we will try and help them  as  far  as

possible  within the means that we have but,  at  the  same

time,  they  should  also take advantage  of  some  of  the

schemes that we have already put in place for them to get a

job or go for the training and retraining programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the CDCs have, in fact, under the current

circumstances, extended help to those who have exceeded the

six months' criterion, based on the particular needs of the

family.   I do not have the figures, but we know  that,  on

the  ground, several CDCs have also implemented  their  own

schemes to try and help some of these families.

<div align="center"><b>AFFORDABILITY OF HDB FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development whether, in the light of the  ongoing

wage  reform and wage cuts, HDB flats will continue  to  be

affordable,   especially  to  the  younger  generation   of

Singaporeans whose starting salaries will be lower.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government remains committed to

providing  affordable public housing to Singapore citizens,

especially  to  first-timers.  HDB flats are  priced  below

their respective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>



market  values, to enable 90% of Singaporeans to afford  at

least  a  3-room flat and 70% of Singaporeans to afford  at

least a 4-room flat.  Those with higher income can consider

buying the larger HDB flats.  Within each flat type,  there

is  also a range of sale prices, depending on the location,

design,  size,  etc,  that  will  enable  applicants   with

different household incomes to choose a flat that is within

their financial means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB monitors wage trends closely to ensure that its

flat prices remain affordable to Singaporeans, even in  the

current economic downturn.  Last year, those who bought  3- to 5-room flats from HDB typically needed to use only about

20%  of  their  monthly incomes to service  their  mortgage

loans.   This is well within the 40% guideline  which  most

financial   institutions  use  as  a   basis   for   credit

assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the downpayment portion, younger flat buyers

would  generally have sufficient CPF savings to afford  the

20% downpayment after working a few years.  In addition, to

enable  young  first-timer  couples  to  purchase  a   home

earlier, since October 2000, HDB has allowed those who book

a  4-room flat that is under construction to pay only  half

of  the  20% downpayment at the point of signing the  Sales

Agreement.  The remaining half is payable about  two  years

later,  at  the time of taking possession of the new  flat.

This  measure  has since been extended, till 31st  December

2003,  to all first-timer couples for the purchase  of  all

flat types, in view of the economic downturn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, in view of the expected wage cuts and wage reductions

and  lower CPF contributions that are coming up,  will  HDB

consider restarting the building of 3-room flats or smaller

flats for couples who are having lower salaries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> As far as different types of flats

are   concerned,  there  is  a  range  of  flats  currently

available, from the 3-room flats all the way to the  5-room

flats.  By 3-room flats, I am talking about the 3-room buyback flats which HDB buys



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>



back  from the market and then resells to those who need  a

smaller  flat.  Having said that, of course, HDB is  always

monitoring the buying patterns and trends.  Currently,  HDB

notes  that there is a very strong demand for 4-room flats,

and this is the reason why it is releasing the 4-room flats

that are currently in stock, as well as building new 4-room

flats under the Build-to-Order (BTO) scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's question about whether we will

build  3-room  flats,  HDB  will continuously  monitor  the

situation  and  make a correct decision at the  appropriate

time.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, in view of the

restructuring  in the economy, we see an increasing  number

of residents asking, because the situation is so uncertain,

for deferment of collection of keys.  Does the Minister see

this  as  an  indication  that they  feel  that  flats  are

beginning  to be priced beyond their reach because  of  the

uncertain situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The experience of HDB is that those

who  ask  for  deferment of collection of keys are  usually

those  who are buying the bigger flat types.  So, it  would

suggest  that  these  lessees  would  have  difficulty   in

servicing their loans for the bigger flat types.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated in my answer, so long as buyers buy

within their means, in other words, take into consideration

their own incomes as well as the flat types and do not  buy

a  flat  which  is bigger than what they can  afford,  then

there  is no problem.  So, the commitment of the Government

to provide basic housing - which is either a 3-room or a 4-room  flat - for the majority of Singaporeans is still very

much  in  place.   But as to specific cases  of  individual

lessees  wanting  to  defer,  HDB  always  takes   a   very

sympathetic view.  So long as the difficulties are genuine,

HDB would usually allow lessees to defer the collection  of

keys by a few months.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, there are examples

of  individuals who, because of changes in their employment

situation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>



may  subsequently want to either withdraw their application

for a flat or to change it to a smaller flat type. Can this

be  done?   Would HDB allow this without any penalty  being

imposed on the individuals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Usually, when a person purchases or

books  a  flat,  he  or  she is advised  to  consider  very

carefully before he or she makes that purchase.   Buying  a

flat is not like buying a TV set or even buying a car.   It

is a very major commitment.  I would urge people who make a

commitment  or  wish  to buy a flat to consider  carefully.

First of all, consider the affordability - whether they can

afford  the flat.  Secondly, consider the timing, location,

etc.   I think it is not a frivolous commitment.  It  is  a

commitment  that has to be taken seriously.   If  we  allow

people to book a flat and suddenly opt out of the system at

no  cost,  it  is going to incur a very heavy  penalty  and

inconvenience  for  many  other  buyers.    This   is   the

experience we had when we had the queue.  When we  had  the

queue, people could just drop out of the queue without  any

penalty and we ended up with a huge backlog of flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there must be responsibility on the part of

every  buyer, that when he buys a flat, that  is,  when  he

makes  a  downpayment, he makes a commitment, a  commitment

which   allows   HDB   to  plan  the   building   programme

accordingly.   He also helps to defray some  of  the  costs

incurred by HDB in preparing the flat for sale.  HDB  would

not  normally  waive the cancellation cost associated  with

somebody who is cancelling the purchase of a flat.  But  as

always with HDB - and I have said this many times before  - anybody who has a genuine and strong case can always put it

up to HDB.  They would always look at it as sympathetically

as possible although the answer is not always "yes".



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, would the Minister give

us  a  breakdown  of the number of 3-room  flats  that  are

available,  in terms of the demand and supply numbers,  and

whether  there is a greater demand for the 3-room flats  as

it is now?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I do not have the figure for the

demand,  but  I know that there are roughly about  200,000-250,000  3-room flats available in the market.   HDB  would

buy  back the 3-room flats from the market as and when  the

demand builds up. At the moment, there is no shortage of 3-room  flats  available for those who  wish  to  buy  3-room

flats.



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, there has also been an

increasing number of residents coming forward to ask  about

downgrading.  They want to downgrade to a smaller flat  but

when  they  go to the banks for loans, they find that  they

cannot  get  a  bank  loan. So they  ask  whether  HDB  can

consider  giving HDB loans, even though it is for a  resale

flat, on a case-by-case basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, HDB does consider such

applications  on  a  case-by-case basis, particularly  when

there  are  demonstrable cases of difficulty  or  hardship,

such  as  a person or a family member has lost his  job  or

suffered  a  salary  cut or because  of  illness  or  heavy

financial   commitments  elsewhere,  etc.   So  there   are

circumstances whereby HDB would be sympathetic to  granting

HDB  loans  even  for  downgraders,  although  the  general

principle is that it would not do so.  I know that HDB  has

favourably considered such applications before.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister whether HDB would consider lowering the price

of  new  flats  if  the affordability of  Singaporeans  has

indeed   become  lower  and  also  if  the  costs  of   the

construction have indeed become lower, such as construction

cost and land cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, on the first part of the

question, first of all, the commitment to make either a  3- or  4-room flat affordable to Singaporeans must be premised

on, firstly, what is the wage level and, secondly, how much

of that wage level should be used to buy a flat.  As a rule

of  thumb,  based  on the guidelines which  banks  use  for

credit  assessments,  banks would  say  that  ideally,  you

should not be using more than 40% of your monthly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>



income  for  mortgage payments towards a flat.  Using  that

criterion,  ideally,  the  HDB  flat  would  be  considered

affordable  if the mortgage payments do not exceed  40%  of

the person's income.  Based on that criterion and based  on

the  figures that we have for the last few years,  I  would

say  that HDB flats are more than affordable.  For example,

a  family earning $2,000 could comfortably afford a  3-room

flat  because  the  repayments  for  a  3-room  flat  would

constitute maybe something like 20% of his monthly  income.

Of   course,  if,  for  example,  wage  levels  deteriorate

drastically to the extent that for that same flat, he would

now  have  to pay more than 40%, then obviously,  we  would

have  to adjust HDB flat prices.  That is what I meant when

I say we would make sure that HDB flats are affordable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether HDB flats can be re-priced because land

costs  or construction costs have gone down, I have  always

explained  in this House that the pricing of HDB  flats  is

based on the criterion of affordability which implies  that

a  certain  element of subsidy is built into  HDB  pricing.

Every new HDB flat sold in Singapore carries a subsidy  and

the  extent  of  that  subsidy varies from  time  to  time,

depending  on the market.  But the bottomline is that  that

flat   is   affordable  to  that  particular   segment   of

Singaporeans.   So  90% of Singaporeans would  be  able  to

afford a 3-room flat comfortably.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, there is really a

demand for 3-room flats on the ground.  As an indication of

the size of the demand for downgrading, how many lessees of

4-room and bigger flats are owing HDB loan instalments now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am sorry I do not have the answer

right  now.  Generally, the arrears rate for HDB  flats  in

total  is  less  than 5%.  I do not have the breakdown  but

that  is a good indication that, by and large, most of  our

HDB  flat  lessees  are able to cope  with  the  instalment

payments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I would like to confirm with

the  Minister that, based on his statement, if  a  mortgage

payment ranges from 20-40% of his income, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>



would  consider it as affordable. Secondly,  since  we  are

currently  paying 20%, if the mortgage loan increases,  let

us  say,  to 40%, is it still considered affordable  for  a

Singaporean to own a HDB flat?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, that is correct. The reason why

we  use  40%  is  because  this is  the  standard  industry

practice,  that  is, one would be considered  credit-worthy

for  a loan if he does not have to pay more than 40% of his

household income.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, in view of the

uncertain   economic   climate   and   the   increase    in

retrenchments,  would  the  demand  for  rental  flats   be

increasing,  and  is there an increasing  supply  from  the

Ministry  to look into for people who want to rent  a  flat

instead  of  purchasing?  Another question  relates  to  an

article   that  appeared  recently  about  a  woman   whose

application  for  a  rental flat was rejected  because  her

child was born out of wedlock.  Why was her case for rental

of a flat not approved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The first question was concerning the

supply  of rental flats. The rental flat scheme run by  the

HDB is not contingent upon how many people want to rent the

flats.   There are certain very strict eligibility criteria

for  those  who  wish  to rent from  HDB.   There  are  two

reasons.   One  is  that  it is a very  heavily  subsidised

scheme  and therefore we have to make sure that eligibility

for   such  flats  is  tightly  controlled.  Secondly,  the

Government  has always said that we want to encourage  home

ownership.  We want to encourage home ownership because  it

gives Singaporeans a stake. We also want to encourage  home

ownership  because, as opposed to rental,  people  do  take

better  care of their flats and they have better commitment

to the flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the eligibility criteria under the

rental scheme, or what we call the Public Scheme, are  kept

very tight.  When people want to rent a flat - if they  are

retrenched,  etc  - and they approach HDB,  they  would  be

asked   several  questions.   One,  what  is  their  income

ceiling;  two, whether they have a family unit; and  three,

whether they have actually enjoyed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>



HDB  subsidies before.  For example, if they have just sold

a  flat,  they have to wait for 30 months before  they  are

allowed to rent.  So there are several criteria before they

can  be  eligible to rent a flat.  It is not  a  matter  of

demand  for  rental flats and HDB striving to satisfy  that

demand.  It is not on that basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is regarding this specific case.

I  do  not  have the details of the case but I  can  answer

generally  by  saying  that one of the  criteria,  which  I

mentioned  earlier  for renting of a  HDB  flat  under  the

Public  Scheme, is that the applicant must  form  a  family

nucleus.  A family nucleus is defined as either one  parent

and  one  child (at least two persons), husband  and  wife,

parent  and  child,  etc.  For the  case  that  the  Member

mentioned, which is regarding a parent and a child  who  is

born  out  of  wedlock, HDB does not recognise  that  as  a

family unit.

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR BUANGKOK STATION AREA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  if he will give the number  of  completed

residential  blocks within a 600-metre radius  of  Buangkok

Station and (b) what are the development plans for the area

and when will these developments commence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there are 58 completed HDB

residential blocks comprising 4,720 flats that are within a

straight-line distance of 600 metres from the Buangkok  MRT

station.   Another  1,395 flats in the area  are  currently

under construction.  These were offered for sale under  the

Build-To-Order  (BTO)  scheme in  2001  and  2002  and  are

estimated to be completed in 2005 or 2006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will be offering another 450 flats around the

Buangkok Station under this year's BTO programme.   If  the

demand  for  these  flats is strong, HDB  will  proceed  to

tender  and  construct these flats, and may  also  consider

offering more BTO sites



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>



around the Buangkok Station before the end of the year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the

Minister  for  his quick action.  As I passed  the  station

this  morning,  new  flats were already  being  constructed

around that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether he has

an  estimate on the number of residents who will be  moving

into that area after these developments within the next two

years or so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I have always told this House that we

are  very responsive.  So, even before the Member asked the

question, we have already responded.  How is that?  But  to

answer  his question specifically, there are currently  two

or three contracts which are already under construction and

they  would be ready somewhere around 2003/2004.  I do  not

have  the  specific numbers here but I can tell the  Member

that we should have something like 1,400 units available in

2005/2006.  Beyond that, of course, it would depend on  the

take-up  rate of the BTOs.  We are offering one  particular

BTO  programme this August, which will be about 450  flats.

That  would be ready in, say, four years' time, which takes

us  up  to  2007,  and  thereafter the  take-up  rate  will

correspond  to the rate at which we build which,  in  turn,

will be dependent on the demand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Did the LTA or SBS

enough ridership?



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think I should leave that answer to

my  colleague.   I  can  say generally  that  the  building

programme  around the station has been slowed down  because

of  the  general slowdown in demand.  There  were  original

plans to build flats in the area, but these plans have  not

been  carried  through because of the general  slowdown  in

demand  over  the last few years.  But if you want  to  ask

about  the  Buangkok Station itself, I think  my  colleague

<div align="center"><b>BUS TRUNK SERVICES ALONG NORTH EAST LINE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Withdrawal)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for Transport

(a) whether there was any study being conducted by the Land

Transport  Authority  on the travel  pattern  of  residents

before  the withdrawal of the bus trunk services along  the

North  East  Line;  (b)  why feedback  from  residents  and

grassroots leaders was not obtained before the decision  to

withdraw the essential bus trunk services; and (c) why more

time  was  not  given to the residents to find  alternative

transport  before  the withdrawal of  these  essential  bus

trunk services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

bus  service rationalisation is undertaken whenever a major

new  train  line is introduced.  The operators need  to  do

this  to ensure that bus services are well-integrated  with

the train line, and do not end up substantially duplicating

the  rail  system, otherwise this would lead to wastage  of

resources  and raise the overall cost of public  transport.

The  cost of maintaining the excess capacity in the  public

transport  system would then have to be passed  on  to  the

commuters  in the form of higher fares.  I am sure  Members

would agree that this is an outcome that we would all  want

to avoid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of any bus rationalisation exercise, PTC

requires  a  detailed study to be conducted on  the  travel

patterns of the affected commuters.  The objective  of  the

study  is  to  consider not just how the overall  bus-train

system can be best



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>



optimised for maximum operational efficiency, but also  the

impact  on  commuters in terms of travel times, convenience

and cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC will then review the proposals submitted by

TransitLink and ensure that the overall impact on commuters

is  positive.  Members may wish to know that in the  recent

bus  rationalisation exercise arising from the start of NEL

operations,  PTC  did  intervene  to  modify  some  of  the

proposals.  This was to reduce the negative impact on  some

of  the  commuters  who  were  adversely  affected  by  the

exercise.   This is because while the introduction  of  the

NEL  has  brought substantial benefits to the vast majority

of  Singaporeans living along the north-east sector, it  is

unavoidable that a small number of commuters would still be

affected  in terms of longer travel times or higher  costs.

I  can  understand the unhappiness of those who  have  been

adversely impacted, and I have asked LTA and PTC to  ensure

that  SBS  Transit is providing commuters on  the  affected

routes with good alternative services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Phua asked why feedback from residents and

grassroots leaders was not obtained before the decision  to

withdraw the essential bus trunk services.  Sir, I am  sure

that TransitLink and the operator would like to do this, if

it  was  indeed feasible.  However, the rationalisation  of

bus  services  must  be evaluated on a  system-wide  level,

rather  than  based on individual preferences or  feedback.

The practice is for the operator to discuss with grassroots

leaders  and Advisors, after the rationalisation  has  been

decided on, in order to fine-tune the changes at the  local

level.   I  understand this was, in fact, done  last  week.

Based on the feedback received, the bus operator is looking

into  fine-tuning the integration of bus services with  the

NEL.   In  fact, I understand that it has already  improved

the  capacity on several routes and commuters are now quite

happy with the services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Phua asked why more time was not given to affected

commuters to find alternative transport.  I understand that

SBS Transit waited about one month



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>



after the start of the NEL service before carrying out  the

bus  rationalisation.  It had also given more than a week's

notice  on the rationalisation of the affected bus  routes.

From past experience, this has proven to be sufficient time

for  commuters to get used to the new system  and  the  new

routes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by reiterating to Members that

the  bus  rationalisation  exercise  is  an  important  and

integral  part of the commissioning of any new train  line.

It  helps to reduce wasteful duplication, and helps to keep

our  public  transport system affordable.   Many  commuters

have  benefited from the completion of the NEL  line.   The

commuting  experience  for  many  Singaporeans   has   been

transformed largely for the better.  However, I  appreciate

that  any  rationalisation exercise can never be  pain-free

and  some commuters would invariably be adversely affected.

The transport operator has tried to minimise the number  of

commuters who are inconvenienced, and I can assure  Members

that  the PTC and LTA will work with SBS Transit to  ensure

that  the needs of this group are looked after as  best  as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, four supplementary questions.

Can the Minister share the study of the travel pattern with

the  ground?   And, just to clarify, the Advisors  actually

asked  for  the  dialogue  before  the  dialogue  with  the

residents was done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: as MOT pushes for the

integration  of the bus and train services,  what  are  the

principles and guidelines MOT adopted for this integration?

Why was the concession of the bus and MRT fare services for

the  school  children not integrated?  With the removal  of

the  many  bus trunk services, the children are  forced  to

take  buses  to the MRT station itself and they  would  now

need  to take both bus service and MRT to their school  and

they have to pay an additional $45 or $52 more depending on

what  card they hold.  This is a 100% increase in the fare.

Would  the  Minister  help these poor  children  and  their

families by providing a cheaper integrated fare?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on the principles of integration, why is SBS

Transit  allowed to retain the services of 502 from Orchard

to  Jurong East, which is on the SMRT line, and removed the

service from Hougang to Orchard which is on the North  East

Line?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question: what is the relationship between

LTA,  PTC  and TransitLink Private Limited and their  roles

and  decision for the removal of the bus services  and  the

rationalisation  of the MRT line and the bus  services?   I

ask this question because this company sent out letters  to

the  Advisors  for  a briefing but not  the  operator,  SBS

Transit Limited, or the relevant authorities like MOT,  LTA

or PTC.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mdm Phua wants the study to be

shared.   Sir, I understand the study is based on the  fare

payments  that are made by commuters along  the  route.   I

will ask SBS to see whether they can simplify the study and

share it with the Advisors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is the integration of the bus and

train  services.  What are the principles related to  that?

She also asked about the concession tickets for the bus and

train  services for our students.  Sir, the integration  of

the  bus  and train services is on the basis that since  we

have  the  train  line and the stations  defined,  the  bus

services  would  then integrate with the  train  system  by

ensuring  that  the  commuters  living  around  the   train

stations  are  conveyed  to the  train  stations  that  are

nearest  to them.  This has been the principle adopted  for

the  existing  MRT systems when they were  implemented  and

this same principle has been adopted for the integration of

the NEL line and the bus routes along the NEL line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked about the impact on the students who

are now required to travel by both bus and train.  Sir, the

need  to  travel on both bus and train is already something

which is being experienced even before the start of the NEL

line  because  students living in other parts of  Singapore

may  have to travel on both feeder bus and the train system

in  order to get to school.  However, I think the situation

with regard to the NEL line is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>



some  students  now may have to travel short  distances  on

both  the bus and train and therefore if they have  to  get

two  concession tickets, one for the bus and  one  for  the

train,  which  is the current system, they  end  up  paying

double.   We have, in fact, asked TransitLink to work  with

the bus and train operators to see whether they can come up

with  an  integrated bus and train concession ticket  which

should then meet the needs of those people who only need to

travel a short distance on both the bus and the train.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was how is it that SBS was allowed

to  retain  Service  502 from Jurong East  to  Orchard.   I

understand that whilst it serves the two stations, it  also

serves  parts  that do not lie within the train  line  and,

therefore,  it was justified by SBS that that  section  was

still needed.  However, the part that ran from Orchard  all

the  way  to  the north eastern part pretty much duplicated

the  NEL  line  and  that is why SBS took  out  that  part.

Nonetheless, I have asked LTA to work with PTC and the  bus

operator to ensure that those people who have been affected

by  the removal of the express bus services should be given

good  alternative feeder services so that they can link  up

to  the  nearest  NEL  station in as convenient  a  way  as

possible.  I understand that SBS has replied that they  are

indeed  looking  into it and that, if need  be,  they  will

increase  the number of buses and frequencies to make  sure

that those commuters who are affected do indeed have a good

alternative service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her last question was the relationship between

TransitLink  and SBS Transit and why is it that TransitLink

was  involved in the communication process rather than SBS.

Sir, TransitLink is a company that is jointly owned by  the

operators  and  it  is  in charge of coordinating  the  bus

routes and payment system for the rail and bus service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why they were involved in the dialogue session

in  terms of explaining the bus rationalisation, I think it

was  worked out between SBS and TransitLink as to who would

take  responsibility  for which part of  the  communication

process.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>



As to why the Ministry was not involved, we are involved in

terms  of  keeping a watching brief on what has transpired,

and to make sure that the communication process is actually

taking place.  We are not involved directly in the briefing

to  the  grassroots or the public.  We have left it to  the

operators because they are the ones most familiar with  the

rationale for the changes and to explain their future plans

to  the  dialogue  partners.  So we have left  it  to  both

TransitLink and SBS to manage the dialogue session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mdm Phua that arising from the

recent dialogue, I have instructed the staff to ensure that

it  is not just the mechanics of the dialogue, but to  make

sure  that  the preparations for the dialogue are  properly

done,  so  that the dialogue can be done in  a  timely  and

productive manner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, first, with

regard to the study on travel patterns, I would like to ask

the  Minister to submit the study to the PTC.  Second,  who

commissioned  the  study and how does the  PTC  verify  the

report?   Third, after integration of services,  presumably

based  on the report, will there be any monitoring  of  the

effectiveness  of the integration, and for  how  long  will

such  monitoring  take  place?   The  reason  I  ask  these

questions is because I have a staff who says that residents

in  the Jalan Besar area are very badly affected due to the

integration  of services.  As a result of the  integration,

only two services are available from Jalan Besar to Shenton

Way, and they are very packed in the morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, SBS and TransitLink do indeed

engage  a consultant to do the study, because the study  of

route  planning is actually a very specialised area.   What

the  experts do is to mine the data available from the fare

payment  system,  so  that  they  know  exactly  how   many

passengers  got up in one area, how much they  paid,  which

will tell them roughly where they had gone through.  So all

this  data mining is done by the consultants, and from this

outcome, they will then have a fair picture of what are the

key travel patterns.  And from there, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>



can  then do their route planning as to how the new  routes

should be structured, and what sort of feeder services  are

needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, this has worked out very well over the past

15  years  or  so since we had the MRT system  and  had  to

rationalise  the bus routes.  What we have  found  is  that

what  is  needed  often is just fine-tuning  at  the  local

level.   This is normally done along the entire stretch  of

areas  affected by the bus rationalisation.   I can  assure

Dr  Amy  Khor  that if Jalan Besar is also affected,  I  am

sure, in due course, they will also ensure that a review is

done  along  the  Jalan Besar area and, if necessary,  more

buses will be put there.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir,

the  purpose  of  the NEL and the integration  of  the  bus

services  is  supposed  to either  reduce  cost  of  public

transport  or  to  perhaps make it  easier  for  people  to

travel.   I  would  like  to ask the  Minister  whether  he

considers this as integration or disintegration of services

because  they  have removed some of the bus  services  like

Service 501 which provides an express service from Sengkang

Town  to Orchard Road where a single bus service would have

taken  a person there.  Now, with these changes, they  have

to  take a bus to the MRT station, drop off at another  MRT

station, and then take another bus again.  So they  end  up

not  saving  but spending more time travelling.  Therefore,

in  this  whole  exercise, I am not  sure  whether  it  has

actually  caused integration or disintegration of services.

Could  the Minister ask SBS to try to restore some of these

services?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I disagree with what the Minister said just now

about certain bus routes duplicating the SMRT line and they

preserved certain routes because there were some additional

benefits.   If  he had the time to look at the  bus  routes

more  carefully, he would have noticed that  a  route  like

501, which is an express service, the distance between  the

NEL  and  the  bus route that is operating is much  further

than  what  this so-called Service 502 duplication  of  the

SMRT line.  This is really not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>



very  convincing  argument.  I think  the  real  reason  is

because  the NEL and SBS are operating the same  line,  and

SMRT  and SBS are competitors and that is why they retained

the second half and omitted the first half.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Dr Michael Lim asked whether

NEL was meant to reduce the cost of public transport.  If I

recall,  I was sitting here when Minister Mah Bow  Tan  was

talking  about NEL, and he stressed the fact that  the  NEL

line  is  going to be an expensive line and that  commuters

along  the North East sector have to pay a premium for  the

NEL  service.  So, we never promised that NEL is  going  to

bring  the  cost  of transport down and that  it  would  be

cheaper  than  the  existing form of  transport.   But  the

advantage   of   NEL  is  that  commuters  will   now   get

predictability  of  travel time, and I think  this  is  the

biggest convenience offered by any train system.  Commuters

do  not  have traffic jams to worry about.  They know  that

the  train  is  going to arrive during peak periods,  maybe

within 5 minutes maximum time interval, which means that if

they are unlucky and arrive at the platform just after  the

train  pulls  out, they only have to wait a predictable  5- 5 1/2  minutes.  Whereas if they are waiting for a bus, they

never  know  when the bus is going to arrive.  The  headway

may  be  7 minutes but there could be a traffic jam  or  an

accident,   and   the  bus  could  be  delayed.    So   the

predictability of time travel is a very important fact  and

I  think that has been the feedback we are getting from the

happy  commuters who have been taking the NEL.   At  least,

now  they know when they can leave their home and when they

are  going to arrive in the office.  And quite often,  they

end  the day with extra time because the overall travelling

time  has  been reduced.  Of course, as I said earlier  on,

whilst  the vast majority would have benefited, there  will

be   pockets  of  people  who  would  have  been  adversely

affected.  I think this is unavoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the express bus services, they were put

in  place  because there was no NEL in the  past.   So  the

express bus services were really in lieu of the NEL.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>



Now  that  the  NEL system is operational,  the  logic  for

having  the  express  bus service in  the  area  no  longer

exists, and that is why they were removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why express bus Service 502 was retained because

it belonged to SBS while the train system there belonged to

SMRT,  we  have left it to PTC to review.  PTC agreed  with

the  bus operators and I would not want to second guess PTC

on what led them to that conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  how can there be more predictability if one  took

an  express bus from point A and reach point B on the  same

express bus vis-a-vis someone who has to take a bus to  the

MRT  station, drop off at another MRT station and then take

another bus to his destination.  How can there be more time

predictability?  I do not quite understand him.   Maybe  he

could enlighten me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, if you take a short bus ride

with   the   improved   feeder  bus  services,   there   is

predictability of catching the bus.  You also do  not  have

to  travel a long way where you are liable to encounter all

kinds of traffic jams.  Therefore, the train ride is at any

time a lot more predictable than a bus ride.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered

my  question.   Can the Minister share the  survey  of  the

travel pattern with the grassroots?  I think our grassroots

leaders  have  been  asking for this  during  the  briefing

itself.   Can  they show us some statistics of  the  travel

pattern  of  the  people,  so that  many  more  feeder  bus

services can be provided and integrated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I did answer that question. I

told  her  that  I  would ask SBS to see whether  they  can

simplify  the reams and reams of data so that it is  easily

decipherable and share it with the grassroots.  I will  ask

them to see whether they can do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the Minister has stated that

feedback will be obtained after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>



the  bus routes have been changed.  Would the Minister  not

agree  that  if the feedback were obtained before  the  bus

route changes, there will be less hardship, less disruption

and  also perhaps eliminate the need for MPs to have a late

night dialogue session and early morning bus rides?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I said, I am sure

TransitLink  and  SBS would be happy to do  it  if  it  was

feasible.   When my bus routes were restructured  when  the

East  West  Line was implemented, I tried to do  a  survey,

which was really a dialogue with my grassroots people.   We

received 101 suggestions as to where the bus routes  should

run, depending on where they and their relatives worked and

lived.   Whilst it is a very good suggestion in theory,  in

practice,  planning of bus routes is a lot more complicated

than  just  taking  a  straw poll.  It  has  to  take  into

consideration  the  actual travel  patterns  of  groups  of

people, not in terms of asking individuals where they work,

because  that would not tell you very much at  all,  unless

you  can  ask  everybody who is living  in  that  area.   A

dialogue  session  does not really give outcomes  that  are

very  usable, but local refinements are useful and  needed,

and  that is where the local dialogue is most useful.   And

this  has been the pattern that we have been adopting since

day  one  in  terms of bus rationalisation, and  they  have

worked quite well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, when can we expect

the  integration of bus fare and train fare concession  for

students to be completed and materialised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I do not have a deadline for

that.   We have already asked TransitLink to work with  the

operators to come out with such a scheme.  They have to  do

a study to see what is involved, because there are a lot of

complications.  Whenever you do an integrated system, there

will  be complications in terms of revenue sharing and  how

to  compute  it.  There is quite a fair bit of  discussions

that  need to be done but we will keep on pushing  them  to

come out with a scheme as soon as possible.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BUANGKOK STATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for Transport

(a)  if  he  will  give (i) the reasons  for  allowing  the

operator  of the Northeast Line (NEL) not to open  Buangkok

Station,  (ii) the rationale for allowing the same operator

to  run  both the bus and train services in the  same  area

without   competition,  and  (iii)  the  approximate   cost

(including  depreciation) of keeping the  Buangkok  Station

closed  compared to the cost of operating the Station;  and

(b)  whether  a  study has been done to  ascertain  if  SBS

Transit  can  operate the NEL viably without raising  fares

and closing down more stations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the Land Transport Authority

(LTA)  had agreed to the request from SBS Transit to  defer

the  opening of Buangkok Station because there is currently

no  development in the immediate vicinity of  the  station.

Although  some  residents may be willing to walk  a  longer

distance    to   use   Buangkok   Station,   the   critical

consideration is that the number who is willing to do so on

a  daily  basis must be high enough. Since Buangkok Station

has  not been opened, LTA has ensured that residents in the

area  are adequately served by buses.  They can also access

the North East Line (NEL) by taking feeder buses to the two

nearby stations of Sengkang and Hougang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operator for NEL was selected through a

competitive tender.  SBS Transit won the competitive tender

in  1999  based  on  the merits of its technical  proposal.

There  are advantages to having the same operator run  both

bus and train services.  For one, it allows the operator to

better  integrate both the bus and train services  for  the

benefit  of  commuters.  Feeder bus routes  can  be  better

planned, and the first and last bus and train schedules can

be  better  coordinated.  Re-routing  and  bringing  on  of

additional  bus  services in the event of  a  breakdown  in

train services can also be better managed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though SBS Transit operates both the buses and

the train along the North East corridor, it does not have a

free hand in deciding on the bus rationalisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>



package.  It  had  to  submit its proposal  to  the  Public

Transport  Council (PTC) for approval.  The PTC  considered

the   overall  operational  efficiency  of  the   transport

network, as well as the impact on commuters.  This  process

is  the  same, whether or not the operator of the train  is

also the operator of the buses in the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong asked about the cost of keeping Buangkok

Station closed.  The annual depreciation charge on Buangkok

Station  is  about $3 million.  This is incurred regardless

of  whether it is open or not.  However, if the station  is

opened,  the  operator  will incur an additional  operating

loss of about $1 million annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong also asked if a study has been done to

ascertain if SBS Transit can operate the NEL viably without

raising  fares  and  closing down more  stations.   Let  me

assure the Member that SBS Transit would not be allowed  to

close any other stations on the NEL.  Unlike Woodleigh  and

Buangkok stations, all the other NEL stations are essential

for serving the developments around them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Government decided to proceed with the

construction   of   NEL,   LTA  had   conducted   extensive

feasibility  studies to ascertain that the  line  would  be

both economically and financially viable over the medium to

long   term.   Although  the  NEL  is  incurring  operating

deficits in the initial years, the prospects over the  long

term are positive as more developments are completed in the

north-eastern parts of the island.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister

tell  us whether PTC was aware that Buangkok Station  would

be  closed  before  it approved the fare structure  by  the

operator?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, unfortunately SBS failed to

inform PTC of this fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Would PTC now review the fares in

view of the knowledge that Buangkok Station is now closed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the fact that Buangkok

Station is closed makes no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>



difference to the fares.  Because if PTC's job is to ensure

the viability of the operator, then it should be increasing

the fares.  So, as it is now, the NEL is incurring a fairly

large  deficit.  By closing Buangkok Station, it  has  made

the  deficit a little bit smaller.  That is all.   It  does

not make the line any more viable.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Can the Minister clarify

the  process so that we will be a bit more enlightened?   I

would  have  thought that when SBS was given the commercial

right  to operate the NEL and they had gone before  PTC  to

get  approval  for  the  set of  fares,  those  fares  were

approved  on  the  basis that the NEL operator  would  only

close  the Woodleigh Station.  So, I am just wondering,  in

terms  of  the principle, whether it is proper, having  had

the  set  of fares approved on the basis of the closure  of

one  station,  to close subsequent stations.   That  is  my

first question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this. The MPs had heard some

rumours  about the closure of Buangkok Station and  we  had

written  to SBS to seek confirmation in late March only  to

get a reply that Buangkok Station would be opened.  And  to

our  aghast  and  horror,  we were informed  that  Buangkok

Station  was not going to be opened just a few days  before

the  opening.  Was there any reason why SBS could not  have

informed the MPs earlier that the station was not going  to

be  opened?  Obviously, if there were rumours on the ground

that  this  was not going to be so, they might  have  known

even at the point of time when they called the MPs down for

a  briefing on the NEL stations.  So, why did they not  let

us know at that point in time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the PTC approved the fares on

the  basis of what SBS had submitted to the PTC.  In actual

fact,  SBS  had submitted a request for much  higher  fares

which the PTC felt should be reduced, because PTC wanted to

ensure  that  the fare premium on the NEL  was  kept  to  a

reasonable  limit  of not more than  25  cents.   Yes,  SBS

should  have  gone back to PTC to inform PTC  that  it  had

decided not to open Buangkok Station



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>



and  that LTA, as a regulator, had approved its application

to keep Buangkok Station closed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should they now go back to PTC? I do not think it

would  serve much purpose at the present moment.   Because,

as  I  said, the NEL is already not viable in terms of  the

current  operating expenses and revenues.  They are  losing

money  and  incurring a deficit.  I do not think  that  PTC

would  make  any changes to the fares because  of  that  $1

million reduction in its losses.  So, it is a moot point as

to  whether it makes any difference if SBS had gone back to

PTC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about SBS having informed the

grassroots  leaders that Buangkok Station was going  to  be

opened  and subsequently not informing them about a  change

of  plans.   Sir, I agree with Dr Michael Lim  that  having

informed  the  Adviser  and  the grassroots  that  Buangkok

Station  was going to be opened, SBS should have gone  back

to  them early to inform them that there had been a  change

of plans.  We had, in fact, told SBS that what they did was

wrong  and  they should not do such a thing  again  in  the

future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

getting a bit confused here.  I am trying to understand the

process.  Can I check with the Minister?  Does it mean that

an operator can seek approval from PTC and PTC, based on  a

certain  set of criteria, has approved the routes  or  what

they  are supposed to do, and then the operator can  decide

not  to follow what PTC has agreed upon?  Then, I am a  bit

confused  about the whole decision process.  Does  it  mean

that  the  operator can seek PTC's approval of  routes  and

then  after that disregard PTC's decision?  If that is  so,

under what circumstances can they do that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, for the bus system, PTC is

responsible  for both the routes and the  fares.   For  the

train, it is a little bit more complicated.  For the train,

the  opening  of  stations  is under  the  control  of  the

regulator  which,  in  this case,  is  LTA.   PTC  is  only

responsible  for  the fares that are to be established  for

travel along the NEL system.  And that is why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2385</b></font><br><br>



I  think  there was a bit of confusion there.  I understand

that   SBS   thought  that  since  LTA  had  approved   the

application not to open Buangkok Station, that was the  end

of  it.  So there was some genuine confusion on the part of

SBS  as  to whether or not they needed to go back  to  PTC,

which is why, as it turned out, they proceeded on the basis

of obtaining approval of LTA, and did not go back to PTC to

inform  PTC  that  there  was a change  in  the  number  of

stations that were to be opened.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one thing

I  do  not  understand.  If the NEL is  not  viable  to  be

operated  in spite of the high prices, why is SBS operating

the  line?  Why did they tender for the line?  And why  did

the  Government award this operation to SBS  in  the  first

place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with the benefit of hindsight now, would it

not  have  been better off if the NEL had been operated  by

SMRT which would then be able to enjoy better economies  of

scale  which it now has, and thereby resulting in a  better

pricing structure for all commuters?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I mentioned in my initial

answer,  the  NEL is viable over the medium to  long  term.

Today, it is running a deficit because the developments  in

the   north-eastern  part  have  been  a  lot  slower  than

originally projected when the decision was made to  proceed

with  NEL.   As explained by Minister Mah, because  of  the

slowdown  in demand for flats, the building programmes  for

Sengkang  and  Punggol  have had to be  scaled  back  quite

significantly.   In  fact  anyone who  visits  Punggol  and

Sengkang will see huge plots of land that have been cleared

obviously for very quick startup of building but which  has

had to be held back because of the slowdown in demand.  So,

if   the  demand  had  taken  place  or  had  developed  as

originally  anticipated in the early 1990s,  then  the  NEL

would have been viable fairly quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why SBS took on the job of running NEL,

obviously it took on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>



job because it was looking more at the medium to long term.

In  the initial stages, it may have run a loss as with  any

new  system,  but  over the long term it  is  going  to  be

profitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, should we have allowed for only one

operator instead of two?  Sir, when the policy was made  to

introduce a second operator, it was felt that it would give

us  a chance to compare the two operators and from the  two

separate  operations, perhaps to be able to  get  ideas  on

where  improvements  can be made to the  operations.   This

way,  whilst they were not competing directly in  terms  of

serving the same area, they could compete in terms  of  how

to  better  manage  each  of  their  lines,  and  from  the

competition  we  could  then  perhaps  share  the   lessons

learned.  I think that philosophy is still valid.  Now that

we  have  two  listed companies running the two  lines,  we

leave  it  to the two companies to decide as to whether  it

should be operated by one or two companies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, can the Minister

confirm  this?  The issue is that in the short term  it  is

not viable, but in the long term it is.  I can see that  in

any  investment, it takes time to pay back.  With  that  in

mind, should we not try to compel SBS to look at the longer

term  gain  that  they  are going to  get  and,  therefore,

subsidise all the bus routes, the Buangkok Station  and  so

on?   In  fact,  the  Government has  already  written  off

billions of dollars on this line.  Why can we not write off

a  few hundred million dollars and subsidise SBS, since  we

have  already subsidised them on this operation, and  solve

the problem that the residents are facing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I think we have to collect the

money from Mr Inderjit Singh.  Just because we have already

built  the system and it is a sunk cost, it does  not  mean

that  the  Government should now put more money, sink  more

money  in and throw more money away.  SBS has taken on  the

job  of  running the NEL.  Yes, they are going to be making

losses.  Yes, they have to cross-subsidise the losses  from

the more profitable operations, which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>



really  the  bus  and  the  taxi  operations.   Should   we

subsidise  them?   The answer is no.  They  came  in  on  a

willing basis.  They had done their calculations.  They may

have made a bit of a mistake in computing how much they are

going  to lose, but it is something they have to live  with

as a listed company.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Loh, you have got 1 minute.



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Just a quick question.

I  just want to have some sense of the scale we are talking

about.  Arising from all these, how many new commuters  are

there  for the North East Line and how many people  are  we

talking about that are affected, and how many buses, on  an

overall basis, have been withdrawn from our roads?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> The NEL ridership today is about

160,000  on the average.  That means we have moved  160,000

people from largely buses to the NEL.  How many buses  have

been removed from the roads?  From the statistics, about  a

total  of  150  buses had been saved.  Has  that  made  the

overall  operation more economic?  I think, yes.  The  fact

that  they are able to save 150 buses means that they  have

been able to keep the deficit within control.  If they  are

to  duplicate both the NEL system and keep the bus  routes,

then  I  think  the  deficit would  have  been  much,  much

greater.

<div align="center"><b>JOBS FOR RESIDENT WORKFORCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Acting Minister for Manpower)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in response to Dr Amy

Khor's and Mr Steve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2388</b></font><br><br>



Chia's  questions.   There has been  some  controversy  and

confusion   since   the  NTU  economists   released   wrong

employment  trends on 31st July.  I therefore welcome  this

opportunity to answer Members' questions and to present the

correct facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, I want to address the concerns of

Singaporeans who are worried about their job prospects  and

who fear that foreigners are taking away their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first present the facts. I have circulated two

Tables (Cols. 2449-2452). I distribute detailed information

on  employment  changes for every year from 1993  to  2002.

This  is  contained  in  Table 2 which  also  provides  the

breakdown into broad sectors.  But to prevent us  all  from

being overwhelmed with details, I suggest we focus on Table

1,  which  gives the total employment change of both  local

and foreign workers.  It is here where we will find some of

the answers that account for our present predicament.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030814/20030814-HA-0762449.htm">Table   1   -   Employment Change, 1993-1997 and 1999-2002 (Cols. 2449-2450)</a><br>



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030814/20030814-HA-0762451.htm">Table   2   -   Employment Change  by  Sector,  1993-1997 and 1998-2002  (Cols.  2451-2452)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1 shows that in the earlier period from 1993 to

1997,   almost  475,000  jobs  were  created.   Of   these,

Singaporeans  took  up about 185,000  and  foreigners,  the

remaining  290,000.   Note that  in  this  period  of  high

economic growth and job creation, more jobs - 60% - went to

foreigners  than  Singaporeans.  But very few  Singaporeans

complained  then because locals found jobs easily  and  the

foreign workers helped us meet the labour demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the later period from 1998 to 2002, about 102,000

jobs were created.  93,000 of these jobs went to residents,

and   only  9,000  to  foreigners.   So  the  ratio  of   9

Singaporean  to  1  foreigner  is  statistically   correct.

However,  if  we  compare the number of  jobs  created  for

Singaporeans in the two periods, only half as many new jobs

were  created in the later period for Singaporeans compared

to  the  earlier  period - 185,000 versus  93,000.   I  can

therefore well understand, as many of the Members  in  this

House   have   told   me,  the  sentiment   of   retrenched

Singaporeans who find no comfort in the 9 to 1 ratio.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2389</b></font><br><br>



fact,  many of them do not even bother what the  ratio  is.

Every Singaporean knows that the job market is tougher than

before  and,  with  the recent spate of  retrenchments,  is

rightly concerned about his job security.  He also wants to

know  why  we allow foreign workers here when our  resident

unemployment rates have reached 5%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are their concerns and let me now address these

more  important  concerns.  Why is the job market  tougher?

As  Members should have realised from comparing  these  two

periods,  it  is  ultimately  job  creation  which  reduces

unemployment.  We are feeling pain because not enough  jobs

were  created in the last five years.  The ratio of foreign

to  local workers is unimportant when enough jobs have been

created.    We  have  about  35,000  additional   residents

entering  into our labour force every year.  From  1993  to

1997,  there were about 100,000 jobs on average every year.

So  in  fact,  it was a grand `job buffet'  as  we  created

nearly three jobs for every Singaporean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1993 to 1997, Singaporeans could pick and choose

the  type  of  job they liked.  As they could, indeed  they

did.   So as Table 2 indicates, they declined jobs  in  the

construction,  marine, domestic, cleaning, kitchen,  hotels

and  even  manufacturing  sectors.  Singaporeans  basically

said no to hot or difficult jobs, those that had 12 hour or

night  shifts, those that required you to commute too  far,

etc.   It  was a natural reaction and the luxury  we  could

afford  in  a time of plenty.  Instead they chose  to  move

into  the  services industry where working conditions  were

more  manageable.  It was a logical choice for some.   Very

few complained when employers who needed the manpower hired

foreign  workers to fill up those jobs that  they  did  not

want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you look at the number beginning in Table 1,

from  1993 to 1997, the number of foreign workers  in  fact

nearly doubled, but very few complained.  But 1998 to  2002

were difficult years.  Skilled workers from China and India

entered the global market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>



The  Asian financial crisis, September 11 and the Bali bomb

blast  took  their  toll.  In Singapore,  fewer  jobs  were

created than the new entrants added into the workforce each

year.   So instead of 100,000 jobs created each year,  only

about  18,000 jobs were created.  Instead of the  luxurious

spread,  fewer and less appealing dishes were  now  on  the

buffet table.  As a result, many foreign workers went home,

especially from the construction and manufacturing sectors.

Only in services did foreign worker numbers go up, and many

of  these were domestic maids.  Hence, Table 1 shows a  net

increase  of  only 8,900 foreign workers  over  these  five

years  as compared to the preceding five years where  there

was  an  increase  in  291,000 foreign workers,  ie,  9,000

compared to 291,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But note that, despite fewer jobs being created during

1998  to  2002,  Singaporeans  continued  to  move  out  of

manufacturing.   The  service industry was  still  creating

jobs  but  not enough to absorb everyone.  So the  resident

unemployment rate rose.  Singaporeans had not shaken  their

attitudes shaped by years of plentiful jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we solve the current problem of unemployment?

First,  we  need  to  get the economy growing  again.   New

investments  will create new jobs, and expand the  economic

pie for everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must emphasise training and skills

upgrading,  to enable our workers to do the jobs  that  are

available and to hold their own against the competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we need to free up the labour market, by

reforming the wage system and retuning the CPF system.  Our

fixed,   seniority  based  wages  are  a   rigidity   which

discourages employers from hiring older workers.   The  CPF

system achieves important social objectives, but its burden

must  be kept as light as possible so that it does not make

our workers uncompetitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we must get Singaporeans to take up the jobs

which  foreigners  are doing, including in  the  industries

which they previously avoided.  In other words,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>



when the buffet table has less appealing dishes, we have to

encourage   them  to  eat  them  because  they  are   still

nutritious even though they are less appealing.  Foreigners

form  about  a quarter of our workforce.  There are  around

200,000  jobs  held by foreign work permit holders  in  the

manufacturing  and services sector, excluding  the  140,000

foreign  maids  and  the 150,000 construction  workers.   I

encourage Singaporeans to take up these jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that some of these jobs are not

attractive because of lower pay or working conditions.   We

have  been working with industries to redesign jobs to help

them  make the jobs more suitable for Singaporeans.  If  we

can  increase productivity through job redesign, wages  can

also  go up.  But we have to be realistic, and Singaporeans

need to adjust to market conditions too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the Government not simply tighten up the

foreign   workers   policy  to  protect   more   jobs   for

Singaporeans?  We have already restricted the proportion of

foreign workers that a company can employ, to require  each

company  to employ a certain minimum proportion of  locals.

We do this through the mechanism of the dependency ceiling.

Let  me  explain that to you.  Beyond the ceiling, even  if

the  company  is  unable to recruit Singaporeans,  we  will

still  not allow that company to hire foreign workers.   So

in the services sector, the dependency ceiling is 30% which

means  that  we require the company to hire  at  least  70%

locals.   This causes problems to many companies trying  to

reduce  their cost, especially the smaller local firms,  as

many  Members here will know from their MPS cases.  But  it

is  a  way  to  get the firms to try harder  to  hire  more

locals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, foreign workers are subject to the

foreign  worker levy. This levy reduces the differences  in

wages   between  Singaporeans  and  foreign  workers,   and

attempts   to   tilt  the  playing  field  in   favour   of

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we lower the dependency ceiling or raise the

foreign worker levy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>



to reduce the number of foreign workers?  Will that help us

solve unemployment?  We have not done so because this  will

be  counter-productive.  We cannot force companies to  hire

more Singaporeans by depriving them of foreign workers.  If

we  make it harder for companies to hire workers whom  they

need,  we  will  make it more difficult  for  companies  to

operate  in  Singapore.   This will  discourage  them  from

growing  their  business here.  Because  beyond  a  certain

point,  companies will relocate in order to survive -  they

have  to compete along with you - or if they are unable  to

relocate  they  will simply close down.  Our  economy  will

shrink, and Singaporeans will lose even more jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the SARS crisis hit the hotel industry, they had

to  reduce  cost, and manpower cost was the  first  obvious

target.  Hotel owners quickly asked for a reduction in  the

levy.  If we had not lowered the levy because we wanted  to

protect  or reduce, in fact, encourage the foreign  workers

to  go  back, the hotels could not survive, and both locals

and foreigners would have lost their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many factories, the night shift is manned almost

completely by foreigners.  They cannot find Singaporeans to

work the night shift, despite shift allowances and resident

unemployment  at about 5%.  Without foreign workers  to  do

the  night  shift,  the factories could not  be  viable  in

Singapore.   They  would  relocate to  Malaysia  or  China,

causing  those Singaporeans who perform the day  shift,  as

well  as the engineers and technicians, also to lose  their

jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other areas, the staff shortages can have even more

serious repercussions.  Take nursing as an example.  If not

for  the  foreign  nurses working side by side  with  local

nurses,  our  hospitals  would not  be  able  to  function.

Members would remember that during the SARS crisis, no  one

would have blamed the foreign nurses if they had chosen  to

return to their home country.  Instead, many foreign nurses

stayed and risked their lives taking care of patients  with

SARS.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor suggested that we introduce measures such

as  those in the US, where an employer can hire a foreigner

only after he has failed in his attempt to employ a local.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our dependency ceiling that we already have

is  even  more stringent than what she proposes.   So  that

even   if  an  employer  can  show  that  he  cannot   find

Singaporeans  to hire, we will not allow him to  hire  more

foreigners  above  the  dependency  ceiling.  Also,  if  we

require  employers to show that he has  failed  to  find  a

local,  there  will be endless disputes as to  whether  the

company  is  offering  fair terms, whether  the  wages  are

adequate,   whether  the  job  seekers  are  qualified   or

suitable.   Better  for us just to impose  a  levy  on  the

foreign worker.  And if the employer volunteers to pay  the

levy  and  hire  a  foreign worker,  when  he  can  hire  a

Singaporean without a levy, we conclude that he has a valid

reason to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries that have tried to protect their workers by

imposing  rigid  labour market policies  have  not  reduced

their  unemployment  - in fact the contrary  occurs.   Both

France and Germany protect their workers well but both have

unemployment rates above 9%.  The same can be said for many

European  countries within the OECD, with  an  unemployment

rate  of  8.9%.   We  have been advised  to  follow  labour

policies of Canada.  Well, Canada has an unemployment  rate

of  7.8%,  so more protection does not guarantee more  jobs

for your residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members that from time to time, we will

have  to adjust our quota and levy system to get the  right

mix  within  our labour force.  But the current problem  is

that  of  demand.  As an open economy, we are dependent  on

the state of the global economy.  Jobs will return when the

economy  picks up.  They will not come from keeping foreign

workers out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I well understand the sentiments of workers who lose

their jobs, and are faced with the problem of providing for

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>



families.  But the way to help them is to create  more  new

jobs  and to prepare them for the new jobs through training

and skills redevelopment programmes.  We also need to focus

on  wage restructuring to reduce retrenchments, and on  up-skilling for employability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government is a government of Singaporeans for

Singaporeans,  and its responsibility is  to  Singaporeans.

All  our policies, including the foreign worker policy, are

directed towards the interests of Singaporeans.  We will do

our  utmost to help citizens find and keep their jobs.  But

we  cannot  succeed  by shutting out foreign  workers  from

Singapore.   MOM  will  give  its  full  energy   to   help

Singaporeans  get  jobs.   One  major  initiative  is   the

Workforce  Development Agency, whose Bill I will be  moving

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have tried to explain the reality

of  the job market, because I think that is where the  real

focus  of this discussion is.  But I would like to  end  by

addressing  some  questions about the comprehensiveness  of

the  labour statistics we publish.  Can I request that  the

attachment  be circulated? [Copies of attachment circulated

to hon. Members.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour statistics are reliable and accurate. They

follow  International  Labour  Organisation  guidelines  on

concepts  and  definition,  access,  integrity,  data   and

quality.   Singapore also subscribes to  the  International

Monetary  Fund's Special Data Dissemination  Standards  for

key  data  on  unemployment and employment figures.   These

standards   cover   four  dimensions,   namely,   coverage,

periodicity  and  timeliness of the  data,  access  by  the

public, and integrity and quality of the disseminated data.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has ever cast any doubts on the veracity of our

figures.   We are ahead of many countries in the  range  of

labour  statistics  we provide regularly.   The  Government

provides  precise and accurate numbers regularly on  labour

market  statistics  for residents.   The  quarterly  Labour

Market  Report issued by MOM gives detailed information  on

the profile



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>



of  resident  unemployed workers and  on  retrenched  local

workers and their re-employment rates.  These are the  more

important indices to gauge unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also published detailed information about the

foreign workforce.  Indeed we do.  I refer Members to  this

circulated  addendum which is the 2000 Census Advance  Data

Release.   This release on the economic characteristics  of

the Singapore resident population is publicly available and

comprehensive.   Paragraph 7 and  Table  2  of  the  Report

provide the breakdown of the labour force by residents  and

foreign  workers,  and the growth of each  group  over  the

period 1990 and 2002.  This is the correct data set for any

academic  to  obtain  the  change  in  local  and   foreign

employment  during  these years  in  each  of  the  sectors

listed, because further down there is a sectoral breakdown.

So,  you  could  derive  the numbers for  foreign  workers.

There  is  no  guesswork that is required  from  this  open

document.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members of this House and others have called  on

the  Government  to  publish still more  comprehensive  and

frequent statistics on local and foreign workers.  MOM will

study  these  requests.  However, Members will  recall  how

from  time  to time the issue of foreign workers can  cause

friction between us and their countries of origin,  despite

the  most  sensitive and cautious handling.  We  should  be

mindful  of  this  regional context and  not  inadvertently

worsen these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of this controversy, if Singaporeans

can  understand  better  the  challenges  of  the  new  job

environment,  the  new  market reality  and  the  necessary

changes  we  must  make to improve our  unemployment,  then

something good would have resulted from this episode.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> I would like to ask the

Minister to clarify that when the NTU's study was reported,

the Ministry did say that the data on the ratio of new jobs

going  to foreigners and Singaporeans were classified data.

But  the  Minister said earlier that the data on employment

change, which he just presented, are publicly available and

these  should  be the information used.  May I  clarify  if

these  two  sets of data are identical?  If the numbers  in

Tables 1 and 2, which were given, were obtained from  Table

1 of the additional supplement that was given earlier, they

also  help its new jobs defined, because from the data that

were  supplied  earlier, it seems that  that  is  aggregate

data.  So it would also include job losses.  Is it not more

accurate  to reflect the actual number of new jobs  created

and  not  the  net new jobs added for our purposes,  as  to

which are the areas where locals could actually look at  in

terms of employment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, if I may refer to the Tables

which I have circulated.  For Table 1, the overall figures,

both  for  employment  change  and  employment  level,  are

publicly  available.   It is the proportion  of  local  and

foreign workers that we have kept it sensitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to providing information in terms of jobs

and  employment  change and employment  trends,  these  are

internationally accepted criteria, so that  there  is  some

standardisation when we are comparing country  to  country.

What  you  do with the information, of course, you  are  at

liberty  to do so.  And here, I need to make a  point.   If

someone takes the information and says that yes, there  are

jobs  within these sectors but he does not want these  jobs

in  these  particular sectors - in construction,  domestic,

manufacturing - that is his prerogative.  But the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>



Government must still give the figures as they are, so that

there  is some level of comparison.  This is what we  would

continue  to do so.  But I have said that I am  mindful  of

the  problems  on the ground, that Singaporeans  need  some

time  to adjust to jobs which they did not previously like,

and  that is where we have placed our efforts in trying  to

get  them  into these previous areas so that we can  reduce

the unemployment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

addressed  the questions that I have put up.   Secondly,  I

would  like  the  Minister  to clarify  the  definition  of

"locals".  Does it include construction workers who live onsite  and  Malaysian  workers  who  commute  daily  between

Singapore and Malaysia for work?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, locals refer to residents.

Residents  refer  to Singaporeans and Permanent  Residents.

Permanent  Residents form about 10% of Singapore residents.

And  of  that  10%,  aged 15-24, about  half  of  them  are

economically  active.   So  the proportion  in  which  they

occupy for resident unemployment would be less, about 5-6%.

And  at the top level, 10%, if all of them are economically

active.  But it is usually about 5-6%.  I am not sure which

question I have not addressed in terms of what Mr Chia  has

said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The question is whether the

Minister  can clarify his comment that foreign workers  are

being  used  to moderate the wages of Singaporean  workers.

And  what  are  the  other  national  objectives  that  the

Minister was referring to?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I went to great length trying to

explain our labour market policies.  But let me address his

questions  pointedly.   What I did  say  was  that  foreign

workers' wages do reduce our overall cost and that  is  how

we make our businesses competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to national objectives, I have said that in terms

of  releasing data, from time to time, there are situations

with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>



country  of  origin from which these foreign workers  came,

despite the most sensitive and cautious handling.   And  we

want  to  be  mindful  of this before we  release  all  our

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the

Minister  has said that 9 out of 10 jobs went to  residents

of Singapore. Could he give a breakdown of how many of them

are  Singaporeans and how many of them are PRs, and whether

there is any other category in these figures?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to raise is that he

has mentioned that many Singaporeans do not wish to take up

certain  jobs.  There  seems to  be  a  perception  problem

because,  on  the ground, the reaction is different.   Many

Singaporeans feel that they have not been taken in for jobs

for   various  reasons.   Even  when  retrenchments  occur,

particularly in our factory or workplace, Singaporeans  are

given  the pink notice while foreigners are still  working.

So there could be varied reasons.  But this kind of feeling

creates  a lot of unhappiness among Singaporeans.  I  think

it  is  important to periodically advise employers to  also

explain  how  the  retrenchment exercise has  taken  place.

Besides  that, there are a lot of jobs which  the  Minister

has  mentioned.   Can he explain to us how  best  he  could

redesign  jobs  or  is there any greater emphasis  that  is

placed on redesigning jobs so that more Singaporeans  could

take up such jobs currently being taken by foreigners?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Nithiah Nandan has asked for

clarification on the ratio of 9 to 1.  I have  given  these

statistics.  It is correct that from 1998 to 2002,  out  of

the  102,000 jobs, there was a net creation of 93,000 jobs.

But  if  that  ratio does not reflect the  reality  on  the

ground,  it  is so.  That is not the figure  in  the  first

place to look at.  What we should be looking at is the  net

number of jobs created and the resident unemployment  rate.

If  I could replace our fixation with some numbers, then  I

would  say,  let us look at the total number of  jobs  that

have  been  created. And the lesson must  surely  be  this:

that we have to create enough jobs at least for additional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>



entrants into our labour force every year. And the  way  we

need  to do that is to grow our economy, restructure to  be

competitive, reduce our costs, and that we must do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of perception, I agree. We are working with

various agencies to try to encourage Singaporeans back into

these  jobs.   In  terms of retrenchment exercises,  we  do

handle  it  together  with a number of agencies,  including

NTUC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of redesign, I would ask the Member's

indulgence to leave that to be further elaborated under the

Workforce Development Agency Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister two questions.  Firstly, he made mention of what I

proposed, that is, try and hire local workers before  going

on to foreigners.  He says that that is more stringent than

the  dependency ratio.  I would like to ask how is that so,

because  for the dependency ratio, the employer just  needs

to employ according to the quota.  He can go ahead and just

employ up to the quota available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is, looking at Table 2, the common

perception  is  that locals shun jobs in the  manufacturing

and  construction sectors.  Obviously, there  is  truth  to

this.  But if you look at the numbers, could it not also be

that,  because there is a quota available to  employers  to

hire foreigners, when jobs are reduced in the manufacturing

sector,  he  just goes ahead to employ up  to  the  maximum

number of foreigners and actually some of these jobs  could

be  released to the locals if job redesign or some flexible

system is actually implemented?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the question to ask is whether

the  suggestion proposed by the Member will result in  more

Singaporeans   getting  jobs  compared   to   our   current

dependency  ceiling because there are many instances  where

Singaporeans  have tried to hire locals, and  they  cannot.

So  if we implemented that, there may be a net loss of jobs

for Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also alluded to the figures on manufacturing and

whether our foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>



worker   policy  has  actually  facilitated  the  exit   of

Singaporeans.  It would be a fallacy to consider  that  the

number  of jobs - it is a finite number - and every  number

that  you push the foreign worker out, a Singaporean gains.

It  is  not  so.   As I have said, beyond a tipping  point,

beyond  a  certain point, with rigidity within  the  labour

market  policies, the economic response would be either  "I

relocate"  or  "I  shut  down".  So  if  we  make  it  more

difficult  for  employers to get the type of manpower  they

need, they would have to do their calculations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I am all in favour of

Singaporeans moving back to manufacturing.  Indeed, we have

been  working with a number of agencies, including MTI  and

EDB,  to have a manufacturing drive.  The Mayors would tell

you  if you ask them.  We have been asking workers why they

were afraid of the manufacturing environment and sometimes,

you  get  interesting answers.  They thought that when  you

don these bunny suits, there must be something contaminated

about   the  atmosphere  and,  therefore,  there  must   be

something wrong with the atmosphere.  So we have to correct

misperceptions like this.  We would continue  to  work  and

try   to  increase  the  numbers  because  there  are  jobs

available in the manufacturing sector and there is a steady

pipeline.  We would increase our efforts there as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, from the statistics that were

given, there is no clarity in the grades of jobs, in  other

words,  the  executives, professionals and the  blue-collar

rank-and-file jobs.  We see that in recent years, more  and

more   of  the  executives  and  professionals  have   been

retrenched  or have been displaced, and they belong  mainly

to  the  services  sector.  I am pleased to  see  that  the

actual  number  of  foreign content has dropped  in  recent

years.  But may I ask the Minister what are the chances  of

this  group of executives and professionals being  able  to

get  into the workforce again because this is really a very

visible and conspicuous group of people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, Mr Loh is quite correct in that

observation. For the last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2401</b></font><br><br>



few  years,  it has been the first time that professionals,

managers,   executives  and  technicians  form   a   larger

proportion  of those that were retrenched. The  figure  was

about  40%  of  those retrenched, and that  is  a  sizeable

difference  compared to previous years.  But, in  aggregate

numbers,  the unemployment rate for those who were  diploma

and degree holders is still around the national average  of

4-5%.   It  is  higher than usual, but it is not  different

from the overall figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they face challenges in terms of re-employment?

Definitely.   We read articles continuously,  in  terms  of

white collar jobs being under threat.  For those of you who

have  time,  I would advise you to read the Straits  Times'

article  by Chua Mui Hoong on page 12 where she graphically

depicts  the problems.  Let me also quote to you  from  the

Asian Wall Street Journal of Wednesday, 13th August.   This

was by Matt Murray.  It reads, "Sluggish US Recovery Forces

Many Workers To Lower Their Sights".  I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In five years at Nortel Networks Corp., Jimmy Richter

won  a  series of promotions and saw his salary  more  than

double,  to  $94,000 a year.  He figured the  upward  trend

would continue.  But the opposite happened.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was laid off in March 2002, and expected to find a

new  job  quickly.  But Mr Ritcher, 30 years  old,  got  no

offers  in  the  telecommunications  industry,  which   was

shedding  thousands of jobs of workers.  After six  months,

he  ended  up  taking a supervisory job at a cable  company

even  though it paid little more than half as much  as  his

old job.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to identify myself pretty heavily through

work", says Mr Ritcher. "Now I'm just Jimmy.  I have a job,

and I am glad, and I'll do the best I can at it, but that's

what it is: a job.""



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even in the United States, globally, jobs are at

risk.  We are under threat.  What is our response?  We will

have  to  restructure  and  retrain.   We  will  face   the

challenges head on and jobs will come back and the  economy

flows.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Speaker, it seems to me that on this

matter   there  are  two  aspects  -  the  facts  and   the

perception.   The  Minister has  gone  to  some  length  to

explain and lay out the facts clearly to us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>



Unfortunately, the outcome of this whole episode is that it

has  created a perception in the minds of many Singaporeans

that  the Government data in the public domain may  not  be

giving  the  full picture, or the picture is not  complete,

and  I  agree  with the Minister that this is an  unhelpful

perception, especially at a time when we should be focusing

on  the  jobs  and  the economy and not  on  data  and  its

interpretation  as  such.   So I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister in that spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the data as presented in these tables

are  very  compelling, but the Minister has said that  only

the  top  line is available in the public domain.   So  the

question   is,  going  forward,  will  the  Ministry   make

available  the additional lines which appear  to  make  the

case  moot?  That is the first question I have.  The second

is, in the job creation data that is in Table 2, broken  up

by  sectors,  it  is  clear  that  the  services  industry,

particularly,  has  been  a  very  strong  engine  of   job

creation.  The services industry is a very diverse industry

and  I  would  like  some clarity or granularity  on  these

statistics here.  Would the Minister be able to tell us  at

which  part  of the services industry is the  greatest  job

creation  because  that might give us a  sense  as  to  how

easily  Singaporeans who are displaced from,  for  example,

the  manufacturing sector, can retrain and adapt themselves

to the new opportunities?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Iswaran for his views.

He  is  quite  right that a single ratio cannot encapsulate

the  economic reality of our job market.  We would have  to

have a number of figures before we can do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of more data, the point is that the

information  that I have given today may  be  new  to  some

Members, but for those Members who had sat with me  in  the

Job  Task Force and the Economic Review Committee, we  have

gone  through  these figures many times.  I  have  actually

mentioned  many  of  these  figures  in  the  House,  maybe

packaged  differently, but perhaps it was  less  compelling

because  there  was not a backdrop of controversy.   So  if

there is any good, at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>



least the controversy got us to focus on a few numbers, and

we  want to know the numbers very much more.  The truth  is

that  from day to day we are inundated with numbers.  So  I

suspect  that  even  though if I stood up  and  said  these

figures  many months ago, many of you would have  not  even

taken notice.  But I take his point that we will try to  do

our public communications better and compel you to look  at

our  figures.   And  the  figures  have  been  there.   The

resident unemployment rate, we said, has gone up.  We  have

made  no bones about the fact that foreign workers  form  a

quarter  of  our population.  Many Ministers have  gone  in

public to say that there are 200,000 jobs excluding foreign

workers,  construction workers, and  Singaporeans  need  to

take back these jobs or take those jobs.  These are not new

facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to breakdown of services, he can get the

information publicly in terms of overall numbers.  That  is

also  available.  But if Mr Iswaran would tell me  what  he

wants, we will try to break it down for him so that  it  is

simpler  to understand and easier to encapsulate.  But  the

information is there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, on the issue of the

controversy, I would like to ask the Acting Minister, based

on   the  data  that  is  publicly  available,  would   any

researcher have made the same conclusion as the researchers

from  NTU made?  Because I think the impact has been  quite

tremendous.  People are now doubting both sets of numbers - the  one  that the researchers have given and the one  that

the Minister is giving us right now.  My point is, based on

the  limited data that any researcher would have, would the

conclusion had been the same?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I have taken pains to show what

data there is.  I am not sure if Members have the time, but

I welcome them to log on to our websites where all the data

is  deposited.   The Advance Data Release document,  census

data,  which  I circulated for year 2000, if  you  look  at

that,  it  gives very clearly in absolute numbers what  the

resident  population  is, what the non-resident  population

is, from 1990 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>



2000.  So that is fairly clear.  You do not need to do  any

derivation.  The absolute numbers are there.   But  if  you

wanted  a sectoral breakdown, here I am telling you  a  few

statistical tricks, but if you wanted specific  numbers  of

non-residents  in goods and services producing  industries,

manufacturing, construction, etc, you can  derive  it.   If

you  are an academic, you should be able to derive it.   So

in terms of 1990 to year 2000, we do.  From time to time we

also  publish  in  terms  of statements  what  the  general

numbers  are.   But all the overall numbers that  you  see,

both  in Table 1 and Table 2, are publicly available.   The

mistake  was  choosing the wrong data set.   We  have  gone

through that and there is no need to elaborate on that.  So

my short answer to Mr Inderjit Singh's question is that, at

least  for the overall numbers, you would be able to derive

the same numbers that I am giving here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> To begin with, I would like to

thank  the Minister for giving a very comprehensive  answer

and giving us an opportunity to ask further question on his

Ministerial  Statement.  I really do not want to  make  his

job more difficult by exploring more the data, but since he

has  given  the data in Table 2, I would like to draw  his,

and also fellow Members' attention to manufacturing.  I  am

particularly  perturbed by the figures.  For  instance,  in

year  1998, while there was a shrinkage, you see the locals

shrunk  by  19,000, foreigners shrunk by 7,000.   In  1999,

there  was a growth and locals increased by 400, foreigners

increased by 4,000.  As you go down that column,  you  will

notice  a  very distinct pattern and the conclusion  I  can

draw will be very similar to what my fellow colleagues from

the  labour unions have pointed out, ie, Singaporeans  seem

to be the first to go, last to hire, in manufacturing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at manufacturing specifically, Sir, over

the   5-year  period,  while  there  is  a  shrinkage   for

Singaporean  locals of 28,000-29,000, there is  actually  a

growth  in the foreign workers by 11,900.  So, contrary  to

our  guidelines in foreign labour and quotas, it seems like

in  manufacturing the employers seem to have preference for

foreigners.  Could the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>



Manpower look at this further and see whether there  should

be some adjustments in our employment guidelines?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Dr Wang is quite right. We have

looked at that information.  I need to point out to Members

that manufacturing also includes the marine industry.   And

wherever  it is, in manufacturing, we have been  trying  to

get  Singaporeans back to where there are jobs.   In  other

words,  where there are fewer jobs created, let us  try  to

put  them where the jobs are.  I do not think that we  want

to put ourselves in the position of apportioning blame.  In

other  words, is it because of employer preference,  is  it

because  Singaporeans do not want it, or is it  because  of

our foreign policy.  To me, I am trying to get workers into

jobs.  And when you finally deal with the problem, there is

a sense of equanimity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the previous exercise, we find that a

particular wafer-fab electronics factory went on a roadshow

and,  out of a few hundreds, finally they could manage just

tens  of  Singaporeans who entered their  workforce.   What

were the reasons?  We will look into them.  We will see how

we  can  change mindsets.  There are a number  of  reasons.

Sometimes  it is transport related, sometimes it  is  shift

related.  But, whatever the problems, we will have to solve

them  if we are going to bring down our unemployment.   But

this  would be a targeted effort and I am glad that Members

too  now  are  aware of it.  So if you have residents,  for

example,  who live in particular parts of the island  where

there  are  factories,  encourage them  to  go  into  these

factories.  We will facilitate.  They can come to MOM, NTUC

or  Distributed Careerlink Network where we can train them.

If  they  are  willing  to go into  these  industries,  for

example,    either   precision   engineering,    production

industries,  we  will  place them, we  will  sponsor  their

training and we will get them jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am following up on my

previous question to the Minister.  On data disclosure,  my

point really is, why not take the guesswork out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2406</b></font><br><br>



of  this?   Because the Minister's point was that  data  is

available in different forms and different contexts and  if

you had induced or done extrapolation on the information to

get  the  numbers, my point is, given the level  of  public

interest in this matter and the Government's clear position

that,  in  fact,  the  foreign  worker  policy  is  a  very

defensible one, why not come out with the data and  publish

it openly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point on services industry, just to

clarify,  the  services sector is a  very  diverse  sector.

What I want to understand better was since there is so much

job  creation,  is  it  in  the  higher-end  in  terms   of

professional  services, which would make it  difficult  for

those displaced from the manufacturing sector, for example,

to  retrain themselves, or is there greater job creation at

the  middle  to  lower-end,  where  perhaps  this  kind  of

transition is more easily accomplished?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, my reply to Mr Iswaran is that we

do  provide the information, as I have said.  We conform to

certain  standards,  but  it would  be  very  difficult  to

provide  information for a specific academic research.   In

other  words, we conform to a benchmark and on  an  overall

standard we are ahead of the benchmark in terms of,  as  we

said,  access,  periodicity and  the  comprehensiveness  in

terms  of  our  information.  We have said that  the  exact

foreign  worker  numbers are sensitive and we  continue  to

maintain  that.  I think it is to our interest to  keep  it

that  way.   But, whether we will put out more  timely  and

more figures, I think we will consider it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of jobs in the services industry, let me give

you a smattering of jobs that are available now.  There are

7,300 jobs available in the following areas and I will give

you  the numbers so that you will have a sense of where the

jobs  are.   Out of the 7,300 jobs, 1,400 in wholesale  and

retail;  1,200 in community, social and personal  services;

1,100  in  business  and real estates; 1,600  in  financial

services;  1,500  in transport, storage and communications;

and 700 in hotels and restaurants.  And, yes, there are 800

jobs also in construction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> I would like to thank the

Minister  for  his very detailed and patient reply  to  our

questions.   But just to clear any doubts that  the  public

and,  including  myself,  may have  regarding  this  recent

controversy about ratios, I would like to clarify with  the

Minister  if  I  am  right to say now  that  what  the  NTU

professors  and  the  Ministry said about  data  not  being

available for them to make conclusions about the local  and

foreign ratio is incorrect because this information, as you

have said, is publicly available.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I had wanted not to focus on it, but

let  me elaborate just a little bit.  What you can get from

public information is the overall number and the shifts  in

pattern within a sector.  Overall numbers are quite  easily

clear.  What you cannot get is the breakdown in foreign and

local  numbers.  And the reason is that if you  can  get  a

breakdown in local numbers then you can by deduction get it

in  foreign  numbers, except for the document that  I  have

distributed,   in  the  year  2000,  where   we   give   it

specifically.   So, in other words, we will  not  give  you

annual  data, we may give every five years, every 10 years.

So  that  is the position.  The first mistake was  actually

the  overall  numbers.  Because they had used  a  different

data  set  and  the  data  set  does  not  allow  you   the

sensitivity to even arrive at the overall numbers.  So that

is one of choice, that is not one of our omission.  That is

really  their  commission where they chose the  wrong  data

set.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mistake was to actually try to derive the

numbers  when someone tells you that you cannot derive  the

numbers.  We had made it so and, in fact, my officers  were

just following policies.  Our statisticians are quite smart

at  it.  But if you are calculating flow, if you are off by

10,000-20,000, it makes a big difference into ratios.   But

the point is this.  If you want to answer the question, why

are  we having unemployment problems, ratios would not give

you  the  answers.  It cannot be.  What difference does  it

make?   In 1993 to 1997, more jobs went to foreigners  than

Singaporeans.  But what of it?  We created 100,000  jobs  a

year,  3  jobs  to  every  Singaporeans  that  entered  the

workforce.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>



So  Singaporeans  did  not care and  in  fact  were  happy.

Without the foreign workers, our wages would have gone  up,

our  business  would have stifled, our economy  would  have

grown less than what we did.  So, in the first place, it is

the  wrong  point  to stare at, the wrong point  to  begin.

Having started there and if you want to continue this road,

carry  on.  But for me, the emphasis is very clear  -   get

to  the fundamentals, restructure, get back the jobs.  That

is where the answer lies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I disagree with the Minister

that ratio is the wrong point to begin with.  I think it is

the  correct  point to begin with at this  point  in  time.

That  is  why  the  Minister has  to  answer  questions  in

Parliament today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to admit that there are too many figures

for  me  today.  But for this exercise to be  effective,  I

think  it is important that people ought to understand  how

these figures were derived.  I am sure he has looked at the

Table   presented  by  the  NTU  economists   which   shows

completely  different  figures  from  what  he   has   just

presented to this House.  For example, for the period 1992-1997,  overall  employment, the NTU economists'  figure  is

254,000 but the Minister's figure is 474,800.  Increase  in

resident employment, the NTU economists' figure is  205,000

but  the  Minister's figure is 183,000.  Overall, for  non-residents, it is contrastingly different, 49,000,  as  what

the  NTU economists have asserted, and 291,000 as what  the

Minister said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is for the period from 1998 to 2002, but

the  NTU economists' figure is from 1997 to 2002.  I do not

know  whether there is a difference between the years  1997

and  1998.  I presume it may not make much difference.  For

the  years  between 1997 and 2002, increase in  employment,

the overall figures are 102,000 and 187,000 as presented by

the  Minister  and  NTU economists.   But  the  figure  for

resident employment is 46,750 as against 93,100 between NTU

economists and the Minister's figures.  For foreign  worker

employment, the NTU economists' figure is 140,000  and  the

Minister's figure is 8,900.  The question is how were these

figures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>



derived.   As  has been explained, the NTU economists  used

the  wrong  set of data.  But in the minds of  the  public,

they  want to know what went wrong, and how do we know that

the figures presented by the Minister are correct.  This is

for Table 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at Table 2, it only gives very broad

categories of industries.  I think it is meaningful for the

Minister to answer point by point and say how these figures

were derived compared to the figures of the NTU economists,

why  his figures are correct whereas the figures of the NTU

economists are not correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I think it would be useful for

Singaporeans  to know the figures. I am sure  it  will  not

compromise  our  national interests if detailed  employment

information is released to the public.  For instance,  give

us  more  details for the various sectors,  the  number  of

foreigners  and  locals who are employed  in  a  particular

sector, so that Singaporeans will have a better idea of the

true facts.  Of course, when we have full employment and  a

tight  labour  market, people do not care how many  foreign

workers are there.  They have jobs.  But now people do  not

have  jobs.   So, to convince Singaporeans, I think  it  is

important that the Minister releases those figures.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, when Mr Low Thia Khiang says that

there  is  not much difference between 187,000 and 102,000,

that  is  a  sure  sign  that we have been  inundated  with

numbers.  I have said that they started at the wrong point.

I  am  not  sure  how giving more figures  will  solve  our

unemployment  problems.  It is as though if I  gave  him  a

sectoral breakdown, tomorrow the unemployment rate will  go

down.   But  I take his point.  So, if Members want  me  to

spend  time  telling them how we derived these figures,  we

could do that.  I could get my statisticians to explain  to

Members  how  these numbers are derived, what  our  figures

are,  and we will invite Mr Low and whoever wants  to  come

along and we will tell them what the numbers are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do Singaporeans know that the figures are true?

That is a difficult one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2410</b></font><br><br>



How  do  I know that there are X number of births?  I  have

not  seen  them.   But the point is that we  stand  by  our

veracity.  We are trying to solve the problems and  we  are

internally  consistent.   We can check  across  information

that  we  give from time to time.  Our job is  to  try  and

solve  the  unemployment problem.  And when  these  figures

come  up,  it is unnecessary distraction, but  we  have  to

solve the real problem.  If it satisfies the Member to know

how  we  derived  the  numbers, we can easily  arrange  for

sessions where the statisticians can show him our data  set

and  within  the  confines possible that  I  have  produced

today, we will show him how these numbers are derived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has asked for clarifications on how the NTU

report  went wrong.  Let me go into the details.   The  NTU

professors started by using the wrong data set.  This was a

Labour  Force Survey Report.  If Members have time,  please

log  on  to  the  MOM website and there is a  Labour  Force

Survey  Report.  This Report is not the first  publication.

It is a well-known report that started in 1976.  The latest

publication  is  the 24th publication.  So the  limitations

are   well  known.   In  the  second  page,  in  terms   of

methodology, all the classes that are omitted are based  on

households  and therefore it does not include construction,

those  who stay on offshore islands, seamen, etc.  So there

are  limitations to the data set and it is  clearly  stated

that the numbers are of a certain level of sensitivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the layman to arrive at certain conclusions and

say,  "Well,  this is what your report says.  You  gave  me

that information."  I take it, but I do not expect the same

kind  of  naivety from academic dons.  In other  words,  if

they  wanted the overall numbers, they should not have gone

to  the  Labour Force Survey Report.  They could have  used

the  employment data, another data set which actually gives

the numbers and they can calculate that from those numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mistake was to try to derive the local and

foreign  share.   What they did was from the  Labour  Force

Survey Report, they calculated the employment change



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2411</b></font><br><br>



by using decimals. Let us say we have 1 million workers and

we  print  the unemployment change figure as  1.2%,  it  is

12,000.  But we round up the figure because we do not  want

the sensitivity.  So it could have been 1.15% or 1.24%.  If

we  are  calculating stock, it does not make a  difference.

But  the  NTU dons were calculating flow shifts   -   small

numbers, even for 10,000, if there was a shift of a flow of

30,000, it is a 30% difference.  Again, if some Members  of

this House make that mistake, I think it is forgivable, but

less  so  when  you are an academic don.   I  am  not  sure

whether that satisfies the Member and whether he wants more

clarification,  but  I  am quite  open  to  give  him  more

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> They were wrong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> And, of course, as DPM reminds me, they

have  admitted that they were wrong.  They have  said  that

they used inappropriate data, that they misjudged the error

of  sensitivities which brought them to wrong  conclusions.

So  I  am not sure why the Member wants to play up or  show

their  mistakes upfront.  I have said that it  really  does

not  matter  from the point of view that they have  made  a

mistake.   If  people  doubt our  figures  after  all  this

explanation,  if they still doubt, there is very  little  I

can do.  But I know what I can do.  I can try to bring jobs

back, and this is what I will do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>4.27 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House seeks to amend the

Enlistment Act as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to provide that a regular serviceman who has been

sentenced  by a subordinate military court to be discharged

with ignominy or dismissed shall be deemed to be discharged

from  regular service from the date of the sentence or  any

date as specified by the subordinate military court; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to provide that in computing the period of

service of a serviceman, no account shall be taken  of  any

period  during which he  is under close arrest on a  charge

for which he is subsequently convicted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments are to improve the

administration of the SAF disciplinary system.  Let me  now

highlight the major aspects of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Discharge of regular servicemen who have been sentenced  by

a  military  court  to  be "discharged  with  ignominy"  or

"dismissed"</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 20 of the

Enlistment  Act by inserting, immediately after  subsection

(3),  new subsections (4), (5) and (6), to provide  that  a

regular  serviceman  who  is  sentenced  by  a  subordinate

military   court  to  be  "discharged  with  ignominy"   or

"dismissed", shall be deemed to be discharged from  regular

service from the date of the sentence or any date as may be

specified by the subordinate military court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Enlistment Regulations require that the

serviceman  be further administratively discharged  by  the

Proper   Authority.   The  Director  of  Manpower  is   the

designated Proper Authority for this purpose.   He  has  to

issue  a  letter of discharge to the serviceman even  after

the  military  court has sentenced him.  Consequently,  the

serviceman  remains  in service and  continues  to  receive

remuneration,  pending the conclusion of the administrative

discharge process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will streamline the process and remove

the  requirement  for the Proper Authority to  additionally

discharge a regular serviceman who has been sentenced by  a

military court to be discharged with ignominy or dismissed.



<br><br><i>Period of close arrest of servicemen</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 27 of the

Enlistment  Act  by inserting, immediately after  paragraph

(c)  of  subsection (2), a new paragraph (d) and subsection

(3),  to  provide that any period during which a serviceman

is  placed under close arrest on a charge for which  he  is

subsequently convicted, shall not be considered as  service

reckoned  towards  the fulfilment of National  Service.   A

serviceman   may   be  put  under  close   arrest   pending

investigation  and  disciplinary  proceeding  for   certain

serious  offences  such  as "drug consumption"  or  "absent

without official leave".  Presently, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2414</b></font><br><br>



period  of  close arrest is reckoned towards the fulfilment

of National Service under the Enlistment Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Servicemen under close arrest are remanded at the SAF

Detention Barracks.  They do not undergo military  training

or  render actual service.  Therefore, the period of  close

arrest  should  not  be  deemed  as  service  if  they  are

eventually convicted.  This would also bring the Enlistment

Act  in line with the SAF Act, which states that servicemen

shall not be paid during the period of close arrest if they

are subsequently convicted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will exclude periods of close arrest as

service   reckoned  towards  the  fulfilment  of   National

Service, if the serviceman is subsequently convicted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to approve the amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read  a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Police Force Act:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To appoint police officers as air marshals;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To provide for air marshals to have police powers

on board Singapore-registered aircraft; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To make it mandatory for our national air

Singapore-registered aircraft.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1970s and 1980s, hijacking of aircraft was

a  common tactic used by terrorists to draw attention to  a

cause  or  to  secure political demands from a  government.

Although  hijackings  became more  difficult  when  airport

security measures were improved significantly in the 1990s,

there  were still successful hijacking attempts.  One  such

incident occurred here in Singapore in 1991 when SIA flight

SQ  117  was hijacked while on a shuttle flight from  Kuala

Lumpur to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September 11th incident in the United States

marked  a  radical change in the terrorist threat to  civil

aviation.   The hijacked airplanes were turned into  flying

bombs  to  devastating effect with more than  3,000  people

dead.   Recently, Singapore was also the target of  a  plan

for  a similar styled attack.  In early 2002, the Singapore

Jemaah  Islamiyah (JI) leader, Mas Selamat Kastari, clearly

influenced  by  the September 11th attack, had  plotted  to

hijack  an  airplane from Bangkok and crash it into  Changi

Airport.  To circumvent stringent checks at airports,  they

did  not  plan  to carry weapons on board but  to  use  two

physically  stronger members in their group to force  their

way  into the cockpit.  Although the plan was aborted  when

Mas Selamat's name appeared in the media as being wanted in

connection  with  JI  activities, the  group  continues  to

harbour  hopes  of  carrying out this plan  one  day.   Mas

Selamat has since been arrested but his four associates are

still at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September 11th incident and the Mas Selamat plan's

are  representative of the new operating environment facing

us today where terrorists have no qualms about causing mass

casualties  and  are fuelled by vague motivations  such  as

religious extremism.  These terrorists are also prepared to

sacrifice  their  own lives in suicide missions.   We  will

have to take these threats seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Singapore JI cell has been crippled by

the  Internal Security Department's arrests to  the  extent

that  it  no longer poses a serious threat to our security,

the  terrorist threat to Singapore has not ebbed.   The  Al

Qaeda and regional militant groups like the JI continue  to

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>



active.  The recent bomb attack on the JW Marriott Hotel in

Jakarta on 5th August 2003 is a grim reminder that  the  JI

is  still  a formidable threat despite the arrests  of  key

members.   The  incident resulted in the first  Singaporean

casualties to terrorism possibly since the Laju incident of

1974.   As  regional governments continue to exert pressure

on  the  militant groups through arrests and  prosecutions,

these   groups   will  continue  to  try   and   intimidate

governments.   Singapore  is  no  exception.   Our  actions

against the local JI cell had triggered the unravelling  of

the  JI  network in the region.  This can lead to  reprisal

attacks against Singapore assets here and overseas.  So, we

are a prime target.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist threat to us is real and serious.

Singaporeans  have to learn to live with this  threat.   It

will  be  with us for the long haul.  We have  to  face  it

squarely  and take steps to protect ourselves.   Since  the

September  11th attacks, the Government has done  what  are

practically possible to prevent terrorism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to counter a September 11th-style attack,

security  measures  for civil aviation have  to  be  tight.

Although  the  key  to  mitigating  any  threat  to   civil

aviation,  including hijacking, is a combination  of  early

intelligence and robust ground security measures, September

11th  has  reminded  us  that we must  not  overlook  other

measures   that   can  effectively  prevent   an   aircraft

hijacking.    Mas  Selamat's  plan  of  commandeering   the

aircraft  without  the  use  of  weapons  shows  that   the

screening   for  weapons  at  the  airports  may   not   be

sufficient.   Comprehensive  security  measures   at   each

possible  stage  of  air travel are needed.   Some  of  the

aviation  security measures already in place  in  Singapore

include  100%  screening of check-in baggage, strengthening

of  cockpit  doors and installing close circuit cameras  at

the  cockpit  door and enhancing physical  patrols  of  the

airport compounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our aviation security measures at Changi

Airport   are  robust,  the  possibility  of  a   hijacking

occurring on our air carriers arriving from other airports



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2417</b></font><br><br>



cannot  be  discounted.  SIA and SilkAir are considered  at

risk because they are icons associated with Singapore.  The

Government  has, therefore, decided to deploy air  marshals

on  board  our national air carriers to secure our aircraft

during  flight against any hijacking attempt.  Air marshals

are  armed  and specially trained officers who will  travel

incognito,   on  board  flights.   Their  task   will   be,

principally,  to thwart any hijacking attempts.   Recently,

in November 2002, an attempted hijacking of an El Al flight

from  Tel  Aviv  to  Istanbul was  foiled  by  Israeli  air

marshals on board the flight.  Having air marshals on board

serve  as a deterrent to would-be hijackers.  Here, I  must

emphasise  that  the  deployment of  air  marshals  on  our

national  carriers  is  not  in response  to  any  specific

current  threat  to  SIA or SilkAir, but  as  part  of  our

overall  strategy and package of measures  to  enhance  our

aviation security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not alone in wanting to deploy air

marshals.  A number of countries have deployed air marshals

on board their national air carriers, as an additional line

of   defence  should  terrorists  manage  to  slip  through

intelligence  and ground defences.  The United  States  and

Israel  are  some  of  the  forerunners  in  deploying  air

marshals  on  their flights.  Since September  11th,  other

countries  have similarly begun exploring  or  are  in  the

process of setting up air marshal units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Air Marshal Unit (AMU) will be formed within the

Singapore  Police Force.  The air marshals  are  handpicked

officers and will undergo specialised training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now briefly highlight some of

the main issues that are addressed by the Bill.



<br><br><i>Appointment and Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 48B stipulates that the Commissioner

of  Police may appoint any police officer as an air marshal

and  ensures  that the air marshals are provided  with  the

necessary  training.   It is vital  that  the  officers  be

adequately trained to deal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>



with  the  range of complex situations that  can  occur  on

board an aircraft.  I would like to stress again that every

air  marshal will undergo extensive training to enable  him

to   operate  effectively  and  professionally  within  the

confines of an aircraft.



<br><br><i>Airline Compliance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 48C makes it mandatory for national

air  carriers to accept the deployment of air  marshals  on

board  their  flights, with penalties  for  non-compliance.

National   air   carriers  are  Singapore  registered   air

carriers.   This  clause is to avoid situations  where  the

airlines  or their crew refuse to accept the deployment  of

air  marshals,  which  may compromise  security  especially

where  there is intelligence of a terrorist threat  to  the

flight and cause disruptions to airline operations.



<br><br><i>Powers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the air marshals are drawn from the Singapore

Police  Force, the officers will have the necessary  police

powers  to  act  on  board an aircraft when  it  is  within

Singapore's territory.  To remove any ambiguity that  these

powers  will not extend extra-territorially, the Government

has   decided  that  it  would  be  prudent  to   introduce

legislation  to specify the powers of the air  marshals  on

board  our carriers outside Singapore's airspace.   Section

48D  will make it clear that police powers will be extended

to the air marshals when they are on board our air carriers

outside Singapore territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by amending this Act, we would be

taking  concrete steps to identify air marshals  as  police

officers  with  the  powers pursuant  to  those  of  police

officers.   Furthermore,  the  Bill  would  guarantee   the

Government's  right  to  deploy  air  marshals   on   board

Singapore's national air carriers.  The introduction of air

marshals,  in  turn, will contribute to enhancing  aviation

security  by  making it more difficult  for  terrorists  to

carry   out   their   acts  on  board  Singapore-registered

aircraft.   Furthermore, it can help to prevent unnecessary

loss  of lives when people on the ground inevitably  become

"collateral damage" when the plane



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>



crashes.   The  deployment of air marshals is  therefore  a

necessary measure to complement other security measures  to

counter  a  September  11th  threat  against  our  national

carriers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I

support this Bill really as a very necessary measure in the

steps   taken  to  enhance  security,  especially  aviation

security,  in  the post-911 era.  However,  there  may  be,

instead  of  public confidence in this air marshal  scheme,

occasions  where the public may be alarmed  simply  because

hitherto  our  attention  has been  to  focus  on  security

measures on the ground to prevent guns and explosives  from

getting  on  board aircraft.  However, with this deployment

of  air marshals, it means that the air marshals themselves

would be bringing guns aboard, and the prospect of a shoot-out in a very confined space, of course, would give rise to

alarm.   So  I  think  it is necessary  in  this  House  to

reassure  the people that this is actually a very important

scheme in the context of security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I would like the Minister just to clarify

a couple of points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I want to ask whether, with this scheme

in  place, the first priority of security in aviation is to

prevent  potential  terrorists and offensive  weapons  from

coming  on board or being brought on board aircraft.   And,

secondly, the Minister has mentioned that the air  marshals

would  be  drawn  from the Police and  would  be  specially

trained.   Of course, there is a whole world of  difference

between training police officers for law enforcement on the

ground and training them for enforcement in the air.  So  I

would like to know whether air marshals would be trained in

such  a  way  as  to ensure that the performance  of  their

duties  under  such situations would be expertly  done  and

with  the safety of passengers, crew and aircraft in  mind.

Thirdly, the proposed Bill says that air marshals  will  be

deployed when there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>



are  high security risks involved.  So I want to know  what

actually does that mean.  Does it mean that we will,  as  a

matter  of  routine, put air marshals on  board  Singapore-registered  planes?   Or does it mean  that  only  in  very

specific  instances  would you  have  to  deploy  such  air

marshals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the air marshals legislation is important

because, as the Minister has mentioned, many countries have

already put these air marshals into service.  If I may  put

a  scenario  in  this way.  If in a whole  row  of  houses,

almost  all  of  them,  except one, had  installed  burglar

alarms,  then  it is quite obvious that the burglars  would

choose  the one without the burglar alarm.   So I think  it

is  obvious that we have to have such legislation.   But  I

hope that the Minister would be able to reassure the people

that, even with the deployment of such air marshals, safety

and  security  in  the planes would not be  compromised  by

their deployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for giving me the

opportunity  to  speak.   Those  of  us  who  watched  over

television the events of September 11 when terrorists  used

commercial  aeroplanes to attack the  Twin  Towers  in  New

York, resulting in about 300,000 deaths, will agree ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 3,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> About 3,000 deaths. They will

agree  that there is a need for security measures on  board

commercial  flights.   The Police  Force  (Amendment)  Bill

where provisions are made for the Commissioner of Police in

Singapore to allow him to deploy air marshals on board  any

Singapore  aircraft  is  timely.   I  understand  that,  in

America,  it was only after the pulling out of air marshals

from  commercial  flights that the terrorist  attacks  took

place  on September 11.  But of course, it cannot be  said,

with  certainty,  that the posting of  security  guards  on

board  an  aircraft shall prevent terrorist  activities  on

board  that aircraft.  But I think most will agree that  if

there  is  some form of policing on board an  aircraft,  it

will to a certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2421</b></font><br><br>



measure deter or even counter terrorists assaults.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope in time Singapore can emulate the Israelis.

The Israeli Airline, El Al's policy is never to give in  to

terrorists.  As a result, despite the Israeli war with  the

Arabs,  the  El Al Airline has a good record of not  having

any  recent  hijacking.  This kind of  policy  entails  the

necessity to build a commando force on standby, ready to go

into  action  whenever  it is called  upon  to  do  so,  to

exterminate and flush out terrorists from an aeroplane that

is hijacked by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of this Bill is only a part in the

building of a complex process of fighting terrorism.  For a

start, air marshals must be specially selected and trained.

I would say that air marshals most likely shall be selected

from  members of the Special Operations Unit or the  Police

Special Force.  Those selected to be trained must not  only

be  physically fit but also mentally strong and  they  even

have  to undergo psychological tests to make sure that they

are  suitable.   They  must  be people  with  well-adjusted

personality and they do not succumb to stress.   They  have

to  be  highly trained with weapons and martial arts.   One

can  easily  see that air marshals should be quite  special

people  and they therefore shall not come cheap.   In  this

respect, I hope that the airlines shall not use the  excuse

of  the necessity to deploy air marshals to increase  their

fares to exorbitant levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the airlines, they should also play

their  part  to  provide security.   I  hear  that  certain

airlines  are already providing bullet-proof doors  to  the

pilots'  cabin and those doors are constructed  to  prevent

them  from  being broken down by intruders.   The  airlines

must  also  ensure that the aeroplane windows are  provided

with  glass that will not shatter when they are  hit  by  a

bullet.   I  do  hope that the Singapore  Police  can  also

provide  our air marshals with special guns, or stun  guns,

whose  bullets will not pierce the skin of the  aeroplane's

fuselage or shatter the glass of its windows.  This type of

special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2422</b></font><br><br>



guns,  when  used  by  the  air  marshals,  can  immobilise

terrorists, but they do not damage the aeroplane.  I  hope,

with the passing of this Bill, Singapore Airlines' motto of

"A safe way to fly" shall add another dimension to it, that

is, "A safe way to fly from the security point of view".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one day, air marshals should be as common

as  the  seat belts in the aeroplanes.  Sir, when that  day

comes, I wonder whether there will be law suits against the

airlines if a passenger should suffer damage as a result of

some airlines, for reasons of their own, not deploying  air

marshals on board that plane.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring up with the

Minister   is   that  this  amendment  Bill  gives   extra-territorial powers to our Police Force.  Would  it  not  be

better if our Government enters into agreements with  those

countries that the aeroplanes are flying to, to get  powers

to enforce certain laws in those countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I presume you support the Bill, Mr Chiam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. I do certainly support the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Both Mr Chiam and Prof. Chin are

concerned about the training and the selection of  our  air

marshals.   Let  me assure Members, as well as  the  people

outside,  that  the officers in the Air  Marshal  Unit  are

experienced  police officers, and they  are  selected  from

specialised units and under stringent criteria.  So whether

they  are from the Special Operation Force or whether  they

are  from the Special Unit, etc, I am sure we have  scoured

the  whole  Police Force to look for the right people  with

the  correct temperament to undergo the training.  We  will

particularly  train  them  on how  to  operate  within  the

confines of an aircraft.  It is quite different training  a

police  officer to deal with ground situations, whether  it

is  on  the  streets,  in the markets, or  whatever  public

place.   An  aircraft is a confined space, limited  by  its

size, and there are many people in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the officers have to be trained on aviation

security as well and how to cope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2423</b></font><br><br>



with  such a situation when they are in the plane with many

passengers.  They  have  to think  calmly  under  stressful

situations and there may be little time to react.  But they

will  not  just shoot on the count of one and  just  shoot.

They  will  look and assess the situation carefully  before

they  take  appropriate  measures  to  try  to  disarm  the

hijackers.   They  will employ unarmed and  close-encounter

combat skills first before they decide to use weapons as  a

last resort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of weapons of course is another

consideration.  The Police will make sure that  it  is  the

correct  weapon where it will not cause a disaster  in  the

plane while it is in flight.  Air marshals are very skilful

people  and  they  are marksmen.  We want  people  who  can

really  shoot straight, if they have to.  But we hope  that

in  a  situation where they have to deal with  a  hijacking

situation,  that would be the last thing they  need  to  do

without  endangering  the safety  of  the  passengers.   So

uppermost in their minds, when they exercise their  powers,

will  be  the  safety  of the passengers  as  well  as  the

airplanes and an assessment would be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked under what prevailing threat

situations  do we deploy air marshals in an  aircraft.   We

will  deploy  air  marshals depending  on  the  global  and

regional  security threat situation.  Before  we  make  any

decision  to  deploy, we will, in close collaboration  with

many  other agencies, determine the threat level.  And once

we  feel that there is a need to deploy air marshals in the

aircraft, we would do so.  I cannot describe exactly  under

what  circumstances will an air marshal be deployed because

to do so would simply compromise our deployment plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked about the jurisdiction of the air

marshals.   If  they  are  on board a  Singapore-registered

aircraft,  Singapore  would have jurisdiction.   When  they

arrive at the destination, then of course we will hand over

that  jurisdiction  to the destination  country.   But  all

these   are   matters  which  are  under  negotiation   and

discussion  with  the  countries concerned.   And,  indeed,

before  we  fly  an  aircraft  with  air  marshals   to   a

destination country, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2424</b></font><br><br>



will have agreements with the countries concerned that they

will  accept the deployment of air marshals.  I can  assure

the  House  that  discussion is already taking  place  with

several  countries.  Once we have firmed  up  and  got  the

agreement, we will start deploying.  I cannot tell  exactly

when  that will take place.  But I can say that it will  be

very  soon because we already have officers who are trained

as  air marshals and we have put them through training, not

just  with  people  who  know the  business,  but  we  have

consultants  who come and help us to train.  We  have  also

sent  our officers overseas to learn from other air marshal

units  the  kind of skills, training and people  that  they

need to have before they can be deployed as air marshals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Israeli example, that is one of the

countries that we have learned from, and there are  several

others.   I quoted two countries - Israel and the US.   But

the  Germans, Swiss and Australians also have air marshals.

We  have  been  in close touch with all these  agencies  to

learn from them.  We will learn and try to adapt it to  our

own situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this answers the questions by the two Members.

But I also want to stress here that it is not just carrying

arms  on  board  that will cause a potential  threat.   The

example  I  cited is Mas Selamat and his associates.   They

did  not  want to carry weapons on board.  They are looking

for  some  heavy-built individuals  who  can  go  into  the

cockpit to overcome the pilots.  But SIA has, over the last

year  or  two  since September 11, started  to  harden  its

aircraft  as  well as its cockpit area.  They have  put  in

CCTVs and they have hardened the cockpit doors which cannot

be easily broken into.  So the airline operators themselves

have  also  taken  measures  to strengthen  security.   But

before  anyone can carry weapons on board, the first  thing

we  should do is to detect him at the check-in gate  before

we  allow him to fly.  That is the process that we need  to

do   very  stringently.   As  far  as  Changi  Airport   is

concerned,  we  have  been  applying  these  measures  very

stringently.  We are working with other foreign governments

to also tighten up security measures where our national air

carriers fly to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC INFORMATION PROCESSES</b></div>



<br>5.02 pm



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me this opportunity to speak on the subject of

public information processes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am raising this matter about information in the

public  domain  as  I do not want to go  into  this  recent

incident  involving  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  and   the

university dons.  Mine is of wider scope and, as a citizen,

I  feel  quite  strongly that what falls  into  the  public

domain  is  something that perhaps we ought to relook.   On

that  premise, these are the three primary issues  I  would

like to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask for greater clarity on what

constitutes  public  information,  who  decides  that  such

information be labelled as "sensitive" or "in the  national

interests".   I understand that nationally there  are  four

categories     for     classifying     information,     ie,

Confidential/Restricted, Secret, Top Secret and Top  Secret

and  Cicero.   Understandably, as one moves up the  secrecy

ladder,  fewer and fewer people have access to the  various

grades  of  information.  But what will be  useful  to  the

common person is to share with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2426</b></font><br><br>



public  how  such  information  is  classified,  how  these

classifications  of information are implemented,  and  what

really are the parameters around such information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a lack of clarity has given rise to some of the

following instances cited by various people I spoke  to  as

well  as  from  my  own  experiences as  an  ex-journalist:

profiling  of teachers by gender and age becomes  sensitive

information  not  open to the public domain;  breakdown  of

foreign  workers  by  nationalities is  secret;  emigration

figures are sensitive; number of prisoners on death row  is

sensitive; the criteria used to categorise employment  pass

holders as Category 1 or 2 are classified information;  the

number of people who are in debt over mortgage payments  is

a  difficult  no-no;  the number of ITE  students  entering

polytechnic or the number of polytechnic students  entering

university - for these instances, the feedback one gets  at

the first entry point is that the information is sensitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then are the classification codes for the above

examples,  and who decides?  Has any such information  been

upgraded  to  a  higher level among the four categories  or

downgraded  and  released into the public domain?   If  so,

when  does  this happen?  What is the criterion surrounding

that?  These answers can help the common person to at least

understand how information is disseminated and communicated

to the general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern that I have is the process by which

information is gathered and collated across the  Ministries

in  terms of consistency.  For example, if the Ministry  of

National Development collates its figures on its tenants in

1-room and 2-room flats and if that data is used to reflect

or  categorise residents as either the "Still Poor" lot  or

the  "New  Poor" - this same kind of database is  stretched

across  to be used by other Ministries to identify who  are

the  poor among us and what kind of schemes should be  used

to  help  them.   My  question  is  if  such  collation  of

information is consistent and in keeping with the  changing

times of our society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to highlight that the

criteria  used to collate information needs reviewing.   If

we  are  really  to  know how a society is  evolving,  then

equally  important is the process of information gathering.

Often,  there is an over-generalisation or over-summarising

of categories.  We heard an instance just now when the hon.

Member,  Mr Iswaran, brought up the example of the  service

industry.   If an over-summarised figure is in  the  public

domain,   it  is  sometimes  hard  to  know  what   exactly

constitutes the service industry and how it is impacted.  I

sit  in AWARE's Sub-Committee on Women and Ageing.  We have

come across quite good data on women-headed households  but

are  stuck  when it comes to secondary data.  It  is  quite

elusive.  Who constitutes a woman-headed household?  Is  it

a  divorcee, a single-again person or a single person?  Why

can  this  kind  of information not also  be  made  readily

available in the public domain?  That is as an example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is that sometimes in policy-making

issues, we tend to place a greater emphasis on quantitative

information at the expense of qualitative data.    To  cite

an example that appeared in the recent edition of Life!, Dr

Nirmala Purushotam, an ex-academic don, struck a chord when

she was commenting on the quantitative data on inter-racial

marriages.  The quantitative data will show that we are  in

a healthy situation, there is greater integration among the

different  races.   But  her quote  begs  another  question

whether a qualitative analysis might show that perhaps some

individuals are not marrying their own kind in an  inverted

stereotyping of one's own race.  That, I think, has its own

implications.   And  we  again  heard  just  now  from  the

Minister  for  Manpower, when we were  talking  about  this

issue,  that there are jobs, it is not a question of  race,

but   there  are  jobs  for  Singaporeans  and  there   are

employers.   If the two are not matching, then we  have  to

understand  why  it  is  not  happening.   That  becomes  a

qualitative  analysis that will steer policy-making  and/or

communication issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that managing

information is a communication process.  It could  be  less

top-down,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2428</b></font><br><br>



more engaging of public stakeholders, less critical of  the

role played by academics, journalists, civil society groups

and private citizens, who believe that they have a stake in

this  country.   A  maturing society cannot  be  told  that

information  is  sensitive  and then  expected  to  retreat

without  good  valid explanations.  The  fewer  closed-door

feedback  sessions we have with the public,  the  more  all

institutions,  including  private enterprises,  open  their

doors  to sharing information with the public, then we  are

really on the road to becoming a more mature society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the cue is taken from the top. We have now

seen  some  institutions with annual reports  that  display

over-summarised  financial statement pages,  and  heads  of

departments  who do not share information  with  their  own

staff  because it is considered privileged.   If  there  is

greater openness from the top down, people below too can be

sharing  information that, more often than not, is actually

not sensitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to suggest to the Government that

perhaps  it is time to consider a Declassification  Act  so

that  in another 30 years or so a citizen can exercise  the

right  to  ask  for files to read and look for  himself  or

herself  a  part  of  Singapore's  history  and  to   fully

understand  and comprehend our evolution as a  nation.   If

that  can  be  done,  it  would be wonderful.  For  now,  I

personally think that getting to information is  still  not

an easy road and there are many road blocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last word on this matter is a challenge: how ready

are  we  to  share  retrenchment  figures  by  ethnic-based

groups?  The usual stuff that comes up with that is that it

has to do with our national interests, our neighbours, etc.

It  is understandable.  But this is our country and this is

our  home.   If  retrenchment figures  are  skewed  in  any

particular way against any ethnic group, then it is good to

see  what  is the qualitative data that supports that,  and

then  put in the skills programmes to equip each and  every

person  and, if it is a language-speaking capability,  then

to  look at whether it is a backroom operation or a  frontend operation that has brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2429</b></font><br><br>



about the retrenchment.  And if it is really something that

speaks  of certain prejudices, then this society  needs  to

look  at  itself  and come up with a better  model  through

better  communication, and we will all have  to  play  that

role in eradicating any form of prejudice, if it does exist

at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Ms Braema has raised several

interesting issues.  I would just like to say, as a general

rule, our approach is to publish whatever information  that

is  useful  to  the  public, information  that  is  timely,

regular and accurate.  So, there is no holding back in  the

publication  of  information.  Only a very  small  category

which is considered security in nature would be controlled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, we do not believe in hiding bad

news,  we do not believe in hiding data, we do not  believe

in   projecting  a  misleading  impression  by  suppressing

awkward  facts.   Our approach is to bring  out  the  facts

openly  and  discuss them.  But we do recognise that  there

could   be  some  sensitivities  involved  and,  therefore,

sometimes, before we present the facts, we really  have  to

prepare  the  ground, because we do not want the  facts  to

come out too cold and the ground is not readily prepared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for some of the issues that the hon.

Member  has raised, by all means file a Question  here  and

the  data will be made available.  Such information can  be

available through different channels.  As I have mentioned,

one of the common channels is for Members to file Questions

to  obtain  specific answers to the areas of interest  that

they  have.  Members of the public can also write in, email

in  or phone in for information.  As an ex-journalist,  the

Member  should  know  that journalists  do  pose  questions

regularly  to  the  Ministries  and  the  Ministries   will

respond.  Journalists also have interviews with politicians

to  gather  insights into issues of public  interest.   So,

there  is a multitude of avenues for which information  can

be  sought.  If I may just go through the specific examples

raised by the Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, profiling of teachers by gender and age. RAdm

Teo just brought the document, and this is an open document

and the tables are in there.  So, the information is in the

public domain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification of information into Confidential,

Secret, Top Secret, Top Secret and Cicero, these are  fixed

regulations,  and everybody in the Ministry  knows  how  to

classify  them,  depending on the impact on  security.   In

most Ministries, such classifications are not germane.  The

Ministry  of  Health,  for  example,  does  not   go   into

classification  of  Cicero or Top Secret.   Most  data  are

open.   So, you will find that, for most of the Ministries,

whether   it  is  on  real  estate,  health  or   community

development, we follow the classification and the standards

and  parameters  set  down  by the international  agencies,

whether   it  is  ILO  or  WHO  or  WTO.   Therefore,   the

classifications  that  the Member raised  just  now  -  the

criteria,  the classification, the parameters -  we  follow

international norms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example which she has raised about

classification  of poor people in 1- and  2-room  flats,  I

think the most sensible way to classify whether a person is

poor or not is by the income, either by household or by per

capita  and  that  is  a  standard classification.   We  do

sometimes  use  a proxy, say, for example, utility  rebates

because to gather household income and to get the household

per  capita  income  is  a  very  laborious  process.   So,

sometimes,  we do use household types as proxies.   But  if

you  have been moving around the HDB estates, you will find

that many of the people who live in 1- and 2-room flats are

by no means poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that our classification goes by

international  definitions.  The question that  the  Member

raised  about  secondary  classification,  again,  I  would

encourage her, where she has special interests, like  AWARE

and  she  wants to go into households headed by  women  and

want  a  breakdown  on  whether it is single,  divorced  or

widowed,   do  raise  these  questions  with  the  relevant

Ministries.  I am sure that they would try and  gather  the

data.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times when we were given these Questions in

Parliament, in the limited time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>



that  we have, our staff would scramble around and  try  to

get  the  information.   But unless  we  have  a  recurring

interest in this area, it is not cost-effective to set up a

whole  data  set  just to collect a set of data  because  a

Member finds it interesting.  I would like to urge Members,

when they file a Question, to remember that there is a cost

to  all the information collection.  During this period  of

fiscal restraint, I would like all Members to consider that

factor carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On qualitative and quantitative data, that is an

interesting point that she has raised.  We always  want  to

raise the quality of our data.  The Chief Statistician  and

the  people in this business would always be very happy  to

get feedback from all of you on how to raise the quality of

the data which they publish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point that she made was about managing

information and that we should be more engaging,  ie,  less

top-down,  fewer  closed-door  feedback  sessions,  greater

openness.    We   all   subscribe  to   these   sentiments.

Sometimes,   we  do  have  closed-door  feedback   sessions

primarily  to  encourage more frankness  in  the  dialogues

rather  than people playing to the gallery or people giving

feedback  but not in a very frank manner.  So it is  up  to

the  organising agency whether they have it closed-door  or

open-door.  There  is  no  rule from  the  Government  that

feedback sessions should be closed-door.  It depends on the

judgement whether we get better and more frank feedback  in

closed-door sessions rather than open to the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's point about Declassification Act or

Freedom  of  Information Act is an interesting  suggestion.

It  is also something that the Remaking Singapore Committee

has  put up and I am sure that the relevant Ministry  would

be studying it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this answers the Member's questions.

Basically,  I  just  want to summarise  and  say  that  our

approach  is  to  be  as open as possible  and  to  provide

information  which is useful.  The only  time  we  restrict

information  is when the information impacts  our  national

interests.   By national interests, let me define  this  by

giving some examples.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that certain information, if released, can

undermine  our  security  or  economic  interests  or   may

jeopardise the political and social stability that we  have

enjoyed.  So there are clear limits as to how much we  will

speak  about  our defence and intelligence  capability.   I

think  those  classifications that she has talked  about  - Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, Top Secret and  Cicero  - are   extremely  relevant  in  the  arena  of  defence  and

intelligence capability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is financial reserves. We will not

publish our total financial reserves or how we invest  them

because  this would give opportunity to those who  mean  us

ill  to use this information to speculate and threaten  our

financial stability.  If you look at the data we produce  - the  fiscal  data, the economic statistics,  the  financial

statistics - these are all very comprehensive and they meet

international standards and IMF requirements.  But we  stop

short  of giving details of total reserves and the  mix  of

total  reserves because that is in our national  interests.

Beyond  that, if you go through the statistics, whether  it

is  national  accounts  statistics or economic  statistics,

these  are all very comprehensive and they meet everybody's

needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must always be mindful of our small size - our vulnerability to external forces and our context in

this  region.    We  should  not see  ourselves  as  a  big

continent  like the United States.  So be mindful  of  this

peculiarity  of  Singapore.  Other than these  criteria,  I

think   the   Government  stands  by  its   position   that

information would be open and information that  is  useful,

we will release it.  We encourage Members to file Questions

to get information in specific areas of their interest.

<div align="center"><b>BRIDGE AT THE CAUSEWAY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Transport

in  view  of Malaysia's announcement to build a  bridge  to

replace  the  Causeway (i) what will be the extent  of  the

impact on our own seaport and  (ii) what are the plans  and

strategies  to cushion such an impact.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has announced plans to replace half the

Causeway  with a bridge. The bridge will allow  only  small

barges  to  connect Pasir Gudang port to  Port  of  Tanjung

Pelepas.   However, it will still take slightly  longer  to

sail from Pasir Gudang port to Port of Tanjung Pelepas  via

the  Johor  Strait, as compared to sailing to PSA.   Hence,

the  impact of the new bridge on PSA is not expected to  be

significant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shipping lines that ship containers out of Pasir

Gudang through PSA, instead of Port of Tanjung Pelepas,  do

so  in  order to enjoy PSA's excellent connectivity.   Some

200  shipping  lines  connect  PSA  to  600  ports  in  120

countries.  PSA will maintain and expand upon this superior

<div align="center"><b>STRAY CATS AND DOGS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development (a) how many (i) stray cats and  (ii)

stray dogs are put down every year;  (b) how many (i)  cats

(owned  and  strays) and (ii) dogs (owned and  strays)  are

sterilised each year; and (c) will the Ministry introduce a

compulsory sterilisation facility for strays and hold civil

society groups responsible for their well-being.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority

(AVA)  and  the  Society for the Prevention of  Cruelty  to

Animals (SPCA) put down some 7,000 dogs and 13,000 cats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, AVA and animal welfare groups sterilise

about  3,700  stray cats and 1,000 stray dogs.   More  than

1,000  pet  dogs are also sterilised a year.  There  is  no

figure available for number of pet cats sterilised per year

as cats are presently not required to be licensed, and that

sterilisation  is  done  by  private  veterinarians.    AVA

encourages  the sterilisation of pet dogs and cats  through

public  education  on  responsible  pet  ownership.   These

efforts  help to control the number of strays and abandoned

animals in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2435</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to impose a compulsory

sterilisation facility for all strays since, by definition,

no  one is directly responsible for them.  Veterinarians in

private  practice  are the main providers of  sterilisation

services   for   pet  animals.  The  SPCA   also   provides

sterilisation  services for strays and issues  vouchers  to

the public to facilitate sterilisation of strays at private

clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA's Centre for Animal Welfare and Control (CAWC) has

provided  sterilisation services for stray cats brought  in

by  volunteers  under the Stray Cats Rehabilitation  Scheme

(SCRS).  In addition, their surgical facility at  CAWC  has

been  offered  for  use to more than 13  veterinarians  who

volunteer   to  sterilise  stray  cats  for   free.   AVA's

sterilisation  services have been suspended  for  the  time

being  pending the review of the SCRS in consultation  with

animal welfare groups, Town Councils and residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA is consulting with the stakeholders to identify

long-term  sustainable  solutions  to  control  strays   in

Singapore. These will need to be practicable and acceptable

to  the community at large. The animal welfare groups  also

have  a  responsibility  to back up their  sentiments  with

constructive action in shouldering the cost of  caring  for

the  well being of stray animals. One way would be  to  bid

for land released for tender to set up and manage long-term

animal boarding facilities for rounded up strays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry collects data on the number of abortions

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Acting Minister

for  Manpower if he will give a profile of active and  non-active  Central Provident Fund (CPF) holders  in  the  last

five  years  (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003) by  (i)  age

(ii) gender (iii) educational status (iv) industry-type and

(v) amount held in the CPF.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b>



<br><br><i>By age and gender (i &ii)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st May 2003, there were 1.3 million active

members  of  whom  0.6 million (47%) were females  and  0.7

million  (53%) were males. There were 1.1 million  inactive

members  of  whom  0.6 million (58%) were females  and  0.5

million  (42%) were males. Over the 5-year period from 1999

to   2003,  the  number  of  active  and  inactive  members

increased   by   5%  and  10%  respectively.   The   higher

unemployment rates in recent years and the increase in  the

number   of   new   account   holders   (especially   older

Singaporeans  above  55 years) who took  advantage  of  the

various  CPF  top-up  schemes  contributed  to  the  higher

percentage of increase in the number of inactive members.



<br><br><i>By educational status (iii)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF Board does not capture the educational status of

CPF  members. However, based on Labour Force Survey figures

for  June  2002,  about 18% of those employed  had  primary

school   education  or  lower,  54%  had  secondary  school

education and 28% had acquired tertiary level education. In

contrast,  about  43%  of  the  economically  inactive  had

primary school education or lower, 52% had secondary school

education and 5% had acquired tertiary level education.



<br><br><i>By industry grouping (iv)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st May 2003, the two industries with the

highest number of active members were Manufacturing  (19%),

and Wholesale and Retail Trade (18 %).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of gender comparison across industries among

active  members,  all  had more male  than  female  members

except  for Hotels and Restaurants, Financial Services  and

Personal, Health and Social Services.



<br><br><i>By amount held in the CPF (v)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st May 2003, the median regrossed balances

(which  include cash CPF savings and those withdrawn  under

the various schemes prior to retirement) of active male and

female members were $110,349 and $80,520 respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of median net balances ie, cash remaining in

the  CPF  accounts, active male members had  $42,688  while

active female members had $35,031.
