<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe):</b> Sir, yesterday, the Member for Bukit Timah GRC, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon spoke about union membership. She has pointed out

that with the changing educational profile of our workforce, the

trade  unions  have found it increasingly difficult  to  recruit

union members and to identify union leaders.  She would like  to

find  out how effective the Ministry's Guidelines on Determining

the Eligibility of an Employee in Joining a Rank-and-File union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Guidelines were formulated in consultation with

the  trade unions and employers in 1992.  It was in response  to

unions'  concern that the pool of employees eligible to  join  a

trade  union or remain as union members is declining.  Sir,  the

unions  felt  that  this  trend  would  not  only  affect  union

membership but also reduce the talent pool for union leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to inform the House that the Guidelines

have been implemented smoothly.  It has enabled the Ministry  to

examine  the  duties and responsibilities of  middle  management

personnel and to determine whether there would be a conflict  of

interest  if  they were to be represented by  a  rank  and  file

union.  The smooth implementation of the Guidelines is reflected

from  the  fact  that  the  number of disputes  involving  union

representation  of  middle  management  personnel  has  declined

significantly over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1992, when the guidelines were first introduced,

the Ministry received a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



total of 57 such cases.  The figure has dropped substantially to

33  in  1993 and in the last four years, from 1994 to 1997,  the

number of disputes has further reduced to an average of about 10

cases a year.  Sir, this trend, together with the fact that  all

disputes   have  been  amicably  resolved,  clearly  shows   the

Guidelines' effectiveness.  It also indicates a positive  change

in  employers' mindset to allow more of their middle  management

staff to join rank and file unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the concern of the Member that with an

increasingly better educated workforce, more and more  employees

who  are  in  executive positions may not be able to join  trade

unions  and  be represented in collective bargaining.   However,

with  the  introduction  of  the General  Branch  by  the  NTUC,

employees  in the executive and managerial positions  could  now

join the unions as General Branch members although they will not

be represented for collective bargaining purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mrs Yu-Foo has advised those in the executive and

managerial  positions to seek the help of the Ministry  if  they

have  any grievances with their employers.  Sir, they can always

do  so.   And  our  conciliation  officers  have  the  necessary

experience and are committed to do their best to assist them  to

work out amicable solutions with their employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, Mr Cyrille Tan, Nominated MP, said that the

conciliation  officers  must be capable  with  good  command  of

labour  laws  and industrial practices.  Sir, I  would  like  to

assure him that our conciliation officers have been given proper

training  and exposure and are well-grounded in labour laws  and

industrial relations practices.  This would ensure that they are

competent  and  effective in helping the  disputing  parties  to

resolve their differences amicably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also recently implemented an attachment scheme

for  our  conciliation officers to work in NTUC on a  short-term

attachment  to  the NTUC Industrial Relations Department.   This

would provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



them   with   an  opportunity  to  develop  close  rapport   and

understanding with the union leaders as well as to sharpen their

ability  to deal with industrial relations issues.  At the  same

time,  NTUC has also sent their officers on short attachment  to

the  Ministry of Labour's Industrial Relations Department.  Sir,

this arrangement enhances the ability of both union and Ministry

officers to deal with industrial relations and personnel  issues

more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of union leadership, while the talent

pool may be reduced, as a result of a better educated workforce,

there  is  now greater opportunity for better educated rank  and

file  members  and officials to upgrade themselves by  attending

courses  at  the  Singapore Institute of Labour Studies  (SILS).

SILS  was  set  up to develop and improve the quality  of  union

leadership.   And over the years, many grassroots union  leaders

have  completed the Industrial Relations Diploma courses at SILS

which  cover the study of economics, industrial relations, human

resource principles and labour laws.  They are now equipped with

the  necessary  knowledge and are in a better position  to  deal

with  labour-management  issues and  to  be  more  effective  in

providing  leadership.   Sir, the Government  will  continue  to

support  SILS  in  its efforts to upgrade union  leadership  and

capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, I agree with the Member that unions add

value  to  the human resource management process in  a  company.

Particularly  in this uncertain and difficult time,  our  unions

can  play a crucial role to help employers and workers cope with

business downturn.  Hence, apart from cases where there will  be

clear  conflict  of interest, there is no reason  why  employers

should deny or resist the employees' desire to join unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a dynamic and progressive trade union movement, able

to  galvanise workers in productive pursuit of skills  upgrading

and  enhance competitiveness, is certainly a plus for  Singapore

and employers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,

yesterday, Mr Jeyaretnam



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



spoke  of  workers losing their rights as a result of amendments

to  our  labour laws in 1968.  It is unfortunate that he is  not

here  this morning to hear the response to his allegations.   He

spoke  of  the Lim Yew Hock era when, according to him,  workers

had  rights.  He waxed lyrical when referring to those days  and

perhaps,  should  I say, through the haze of time,  the  picture

looks rather different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel obliged to complete the picture for hon.

Members  in  this House.  Mr Jeyaretnam forgot to  tell  Members

that  in  the Lim Yew Hock era, workers faced great difficulties

in  getting jobs.  Unemployment was very much higher than it  is

today.  Workers who had jobs were paid poorly.  They were indeed

at  the  mercy  of their employers.  This was the case  because,

with so many unemployed people, employers could pick and choose.

Workers and their families lived in squalid huts or over-crowded

tenements.  Many workers' children had to leave school early  to

help  the  family  eke  out a living.   The  economy  was  going

nowhere.  The future was bleak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also forgot to inform this House that in

those  days, trade unions often took industrial actions  without

securing a mandate from their members, the workers, and  without

giving due regard to the viability of the company or the welfare

of  the  workers.  Trade unions also intervened in issues  which

should  rightly  be the management functions,  such  as  hiring,

promotion,  transfer, dismissal and assignment of  duties.   The

union's intervention had resulted in endless disputes leading to

confrontation and strikes at the workplace.  They did so because

many  unions  had  a political agenda  and workers'  rights  and

interests and welfare were the least of their concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the labour laws, prior to 1968, had inherent

weaknesses  that caused low productivity and inefficiency  which

were often subjected to abuse by workers and their unions.  This

was  the  era of highly adversarial and confrontational  labour-management  relations.  There were more than 40 strikes  a  year

paralysing trade, commerce and, indeed, the lives of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



ordinary  citizens.   In  1955 alone,  there  were  275  strikes

resulting in the loss of almost 1 million man-days.  The  damage

inflicted  on  the  economy  was devastating.   The  outcome  of

confrontational and adversarial labour-management relations  was

a  poor  investment  climate, economic stagnation,  unfavourable

working  conditions and terms, high unemployment and  the  bleak

future for Singaporeans.  It was for this reason that the labour

laws  were amended in 1968 to provide a more rational basis  for

industrial  relations.  The distinction was  drawn  between  the

functions  of  management  and trade unions  for  balancing  the

interests  of  both parties.  Thus, under the new provisions  in

the  Industrial Relations Act, matters like promotion, transfer,

hiring,  right to retrench, dismissal and assignment  of  duties

were  excluded from collective bargaining between  trade  unions

and  employers.  To prevent abuses by employers, the law enables

workers  and  trade unions to seek redress through  conciliation

and adjudication including appeals against unfair dismissal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Employment Act introduced in 1968, the basic

terms  and  conditions of employment as well as  the  rights  of

employees  were rationalised.  I must, however, point  out  that

while   employers  were  given  the  discretion  to  carry   out

fundamental management functions without being subjected to  the

process  of collective bargaining, the rights of unions to  take

industrial action were not removed.  These rights continue to be

enshrined in the Trade Unions Act.  The only difference is  that

a  union  which intends to take strike action must first  obtain

the  consent and mandate of its members through a secret ballot.

I would like to inform the House that the need to seek a mandate

of members through secret ballot before an industrial action has

also  been  introduced in countries like the United Kingdom  and

Australia.  The requirement of the secret ballot is in line with

democratic  principle that such an extreme action  must  reflect

the collective wishes of the members of the union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam has advocated a return to confrontation

and adversarial labour-management relations.  He fails to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



notice that many countries all over the world are trying hard to

promote  industrial  harmony  so  that  they  could  provide   a

favourable  investment  climate  for  economic  growth  and  job

creation.   Would  Mr Jeyaretnam like to see  a  return  to  the

industrial strifes of the 50s that resulted in low productivity,

economic stagnation, poor working conditions, low wages and high

unemployment?   When he called for the restoration  of  workers'

and trade unions' rights in the 50s, does he realise that he  is

in  fact  setting  the stage for abuses of  rights  and  labour-management confrontation and job losses?  On the other hand, the

PAP Government's effort over the years resulted in close labour-management cooperation, discipline and higher productivity. This

has  helped  us to attract high quality investments  and  better

paying jobs for Singaporeans.  Singapore has been enjoying  full

employment since the early 70s.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam also commented that there was a need to

set  up a tribunal with representatives from employers and trade

unions.   I find that strange.  But then he has already admitted

to  this House that he does not read NTUC News.  I know that  he

is  not likely to read the Lianhe Zaobao.  I am not sure  if  he

reads  the  Straits Times and many other publications issued  by

the  Government  and even from my Ministry from  time  to  time.

Generally, I find that he is quite ill informed on many  issues.

If he had been more widely read or taken the trouble to research

his  topics  that he wants to speak on, he would have discovered

that  such  a  tribunal already exists in our  system.   When  a

dispute, involving a trade union on the one hand and an employer

on   the   other,   cannot  be  resolved  through  conciliation,

arbitration of the dispute would be heard by a tripartite panel,

comprising  representatives from the trade union  and  employers

and  presided over by a neutral third party who is a High  Court

Judge.   This  tripartite  panel is our  Industrial  Arbitration

Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam says that he hardly heard of disputes being

dealt with by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



IAC,  and  then  implies that the mechanism is  not  functioning

properly  since he has not heard of disputes being  dealt  with.

The  main reason for the lack of disputes and the low number  of

cases  having  to  be  referred to the  IAC  is  the  result  of

cooperation  and  amicable resolution of  differences  at  every

level.   Because of responsible union leadership and enlightened

management,  most  of  the disputes had  been  settled  amicably

through  discussion, either at the company level or conciliation

at the Ministry of Labour.  We should keep it this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our ability to strike a fair and equitable balance

between  the interest of employers and workers within our  legal

framework has enabled Singapore to be consistently rated as  one

of  the  most attractive places for investments, and  has  often

topped the world competitiveness ranking.  Our favourable  legal

framework  has  also been a key factor in Singapore's  workforce

being regularly rated by BERI as number one in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me take this opportunity to quickly explain to the

House   the  dangers  of  over  protective  labour  laws.    The

experience  of  many  European countries  has  shown  that  over

protective labour legislation has caused labour market rigidity,

leading  to  unsustainable cost of doing business.  They  impede

companies'  efforts to restructure and upgrade their  operations

to  meet  new  challenges.  As companies are unable  to  operate

efficiently,  many of them had, over time, become uncompetitive.

The  end result is loss of jobs, economic stagnation and  higher

unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an OECD study on unemployment in May 1994 concluded

that  employment protection legislation, which  is  designed  to

discourage  dismissal by raising the cost of releasing  workers,

has  made  employers more reluctant to hire new  workers.   Many

countries  in  Europe,  which  have  particularly  stringent  or

restrictive   labour  legislation,  generally  have   a   higher

unemployment  rate and employers frequently resort to  temporary

contract  and  other  non-standard forms of employment  to  meet

their needs for workers during times of market upturn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study made many recommendations. I will just quickly

highlight  three  for Members' interest.  (1)  Wage  and  labour

costs be made more flexible and that unnecessary restrictions be

removed.   (2)  Employment security provisions that inhibit  the

expansion of employment in the private sector be reformed.   (3)

Unemployment  and  related benefit systems  be  restructured  to

achieve society's fundamental equity goal, such that - and  this

is  important - the infringement of the efficient functioning of

labour markets would be minimised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the OECD study and its recommendations clearly

demonstrated  that rigid and over protective labour  legislation

would  undermine the efficient functioning of the labour market,

stifle entrepreneurship and retard job creation.  Hence, we must

learn from their experience and avoid making the same mistakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the liberalisation of the world economy, global

competition  has intensified.  We must therefore  guard  against

the  tendency to introduce protective and popular policies  that

will  in  fact  introduce rigidity into our  labour  market  and

undermine   our  long-term  competitiveness.   Mr   Jeyaretnam's

question  on  workers'  rights,  therefore,  sounds  hollow  and

irrelevant.   If workers had their rights removed unfairly,  why

did  Mr  Jeyaretnam, as leader of the Workers'  Party,  wait  30

years  to  raise  this issue?  The Workers'  Party  should  have

campaigned  in  every general election for  the  restoration  of

these  so-called  rights.  Perhaps he knows  in  his  heart  the

danger  and  foolishness of taking a course of action  that  can

only lead to more disputes and upheaval.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, on the "Gender

Income  Gap",  the Department of Statistics in  Singapore  found

that  the  ratio of female to male income declined from  73%  in

1990  to 59% in 1995; that the income of the male workforce grew

at  a  faster  rate; that there were more males  in  the  higher

income  groups  and  that  there was a larger  increase  in  the

proportion  of males with monthly incomes of $3,000  and  above.

All these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



indicate  the  significant  widening  in  wage  gap  and  career

potential to the disadvantage of women in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should this be so in Singapore? We are supposed to

have equal opportunities, regardless of gender, in education and

in  career-seeking. And we have a system based  on  meritocracy.

Why  are the returns from investing in our female population not

yielding  the  same  accretion?  Is there  a  shortfall  in  the

contribution of our women to the economy as a result of this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are some areas that are worth looking into in

this context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Human capital investment. Firms may anticipate a higher

quit  rate  from women than men.  As such, they may be  cautious

when  it  comes to investing in female employees for  fear  that

they  would not recover their investment.  As a result  of  such

forfeited  career  opportunities, women not only  have  loss  of

earnings  but  also loss in economic values within the  society.

Perhaps  employers  may adopt a new mindset with  some  sort  of

help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Double burden. There is a possibility that women may be

more  likely to shirk on the job than men.   This might  be  the

case  because child-care responsibilities are more a distraction

for  women  than  men.   Having children does  impose  workplace

limitations  on  women.  Perhaps we should look  deeper  at  our

child-caring  facilities,  namely, maids,  grandparents,  foster

homes and child-care centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Women's perception. Women are often subjected to

socialisation as less able to handle risk-taking  and  as  being

less confident of their abilities.  This could  be a factor that

plays a critical role in their expectations towards the salaries

they deserve and therefore their perceptions towards the careers

they  choose.  This factor may also result in the lesser demands

by women when it comes to wage negotiations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Societal conditioning. The influence of societal

conditioning  as the source of occupational crowding  towards  a

narrow  set  of  "women's  occupations"  is  worth  looking  at.

Whether  these  "women occupations" are really worth  so  little

that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



usually  command less lucrative rates on the whole ought  to  be

studied.   Are there stereotyping and bias amongst  the  policy-makers, teachers and counsellors that deter girls and women from

advancing  their  education and entering  the  traditional  male

domains?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Technological innovations. There is increasing stress

towards higher value-added activities.  New-age technology  that

points  towards  the  ascendancy of  electronics  and  computer-related industries may require people with strong background  in

mathematics.    This  is  an  area which  is  traditionally  the

stronghold of men.   Are Singaporean women more likely  to  shun

these "high-tech" occupations by choice or by preference?  Do we

need to change this mindset?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Reproductive role. To fulfil this role, women are

required, at one time or another, to consider discontinuity  and

subsequent reintegration in their jobs.  Effectively,  they  are

prevented  from full integration at their jobs.   The  resultant

effect   is  that  they  renounce  their  ambitions  and  resign

themselves to those lesser employment prospects than what  their

qualification would warrant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it should be a worthwhile exercise to study and

ascertain these elements within the Singapore context.  I  would

like  to suggest that the Ministry of Manpower do this and  help

us  overcome  some of our shortcomings and enable the  Singapore

woman  realise  her  true and rightful place  in  the  Singapore

economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in this cut, I was

originally going to ask the Minister for Manpower to help reduce

the  cost  of  hiring  skilled foreign  workers,  basically  the

foreign worker levy to $100.  I am glad to note that I was  pre-empted  and  the Minister has announced that this  is  going  to

happen very soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure this will go a long way in helping the

manufacturing  and  service  sectors reduce  the  labour-related

cost.   I  hope that this will apply to foreign workers  of  all

nationalities and not restricted to certain nationalities only.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



However, I would like to still ask the Minister to consider some

temporary  measures for all existing foreign workers,  including

unskilled  workers.   This  request is  to  help  companies  get

through the tough times expected in the next two years or so.  I

would  like  to  suggest that the Minister consider  temporarily

reducing the levy for all foreign workers to $100 for the next 1-2  years.  And with the understanding that it would be raised to

the original levels once things stabilise in our economy.  I  am

sure this will help our businesses survive the tough time in the

next few years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to

address  the  problem  of run away foreign workers  and  foreign

maids.  I would like to suggest imposing a security bond on  all

foreign  workers  and foreign maids, as one way  to  tackle  the

problem of run away foreign workers and missing maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, the Minister for Home Affairs announced

that  such  a security bond would be imposed on foreign  workers

from two foreign countries.  I see no reason why this should not

apply to foreign workers and maids from other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, I would suggest that the foreign workers and

foreign  maids  can be asked to contribute 20% of their  monthly

income  to  a  foreign  labour fund to be  administered  by  the

Manpower  Ministry.   This  is  to  make  all  foreign   workers

themselves  responsible  for  their  good  behaviour  while   in

Singapore.   Upon completion of their contract in  Singapore  or

upon  the  cancellation of their work permit, their contribution

will  then  be returned to them when they pack up and  go  home,

perhaps with some interest earned, similar to the CPF fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign labour fund can be deemed as some kind of a

good  behaviour  bond.   By running away or  committing  serious

offences,  foreign workers would put their foreign  labour  fund

savings  in  jeopardy.  This could deter many  from  misbehaving

while in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, irregardless of whether an employer is at fault

when a work permit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



holder  goes missing and cannot be traced, the security bond  of

the  employer  is  forfeited.  I would like to suggest  that  in

cases  where it can be established that an employer  is  not  at

fault,  then  the  security  bond  or  deposit  should  not   be

forfeited.   Of  course, the burden of proof should  be  on  the

employer.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, still on the issue of

foreign  maids.   The Ministry of Labour announced  in  November

last  year that the foreign domestic worker levy would go up  by

$15  a  month  with effect from 1st April 1998, ie, next  month.

This  is  to  be followed by small annual revisions  thereafter.

The objective of the foreign domestic worker levy, according  to

the  Ministry,  is  to  regulate  demand  for  foreign  domestic

workers,  and  to  discourage Singaporeans from becoming  overly

reliant on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a working couple trying to juggle between babies,

housework,  career and upgrading their skills  and  studies  are

already  finding  their lives very stressful.   Thus,  it  would

appear to me that even if the Government continues to raise  the

foreign  domestic  worker levy, the demand  will  remain  fairly

inelastic.  For those in this category having a maid  is  really

not an option.  The concern over the levy increase lies not only

in  the higher costs to households, especially for young working

couples,  but more importantly, the availability of alternatives

such as childcare centres.  There are also those who are in need

of  a maid to look after their beloved elderly while they are at

work.  Having a maid for this group is a necessity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must not be seen to be sending confusing

signals.   If  Singapore  wants its women  to  come  forward  to

contribute economically, then there must be assurance that their

children  are  not deprived of proper and dedicated  care.   The

question then is how the Ministry could ensure that the measures

taken  to  increase the maid levy really meet its  objective  in

terms of controlling the numbers while at the same time ensuring

that  those  really in need of a maid service are not  deprived.

In the wake of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



current   economic   downturn,  will  the  Minister   reconsider

deferring the increase of the foreign domestic worker levy until

the situation improves, as it may adversely impact those who are

affected  by  the current economic conditions, but at  the  same

time  are  still  dependent on the services of foreign  domestic

maids.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have to remind Members that the

"guillotine" time is at 1.55 pm and we seem to have still  quite

a long list of speakers.  Mr Chuang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

First,  I would like to declare my interest as a Director  of  a

construction company. However, I have no pecuniary  interest  in

the subject matter that I will be speaking on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, more than 90% of the workers in the

construction  industry  are foreign  workers.   At  present,  an

employer  has  to pay foreign worker levy to the  Government  at

$200 for each skilled worker and $440 for each unskilled worker.

The  difference of $240 is to encourage the employers to  engage

more  skilled  workers in order to improve productivity  in  the

construction industry. This policy is correct and encouraging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry is a very competitive industry.

Since  the  Government's announcement of the adjustment  to  the

foreign  worker levy at the end of last year, many  construction

companies  have  been  trying very hard to secure  more  skilled

workers to replace the unskilled workers, in order to cut cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the Singapore Government's

Construction  Industry  Training School has  been  flooded  with

applications from many construction companies for their  workers

to   be   trained  and  to  sit  for  the  skills  certification

examination.  The response was so overwhelming that  the  school

is  finding  it difficult to cope.  Obviously, this strategy  to

actively encourage the workers to increase their skill level  is

like  "sending burning charcoal in a snowing weather".  It is  a

timely help to the industry, and is significantly effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the original purpose of the foreign workers

levy is to increase the cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



of employing foreign workers so as to prevent the employers from

employing  cheap foreign workers to replace the  more  expensive

local  workers.  However, after years of implementation of  this

policy,  and the levy being raised year after year,  the  number

of  local  workers  entering the construction industry  has  not

increased, but has actually reduced.  Even the supervisory-level

work,  which  was  formerly dominated by  Singaporeans,  is  now

gradually   taken  over  by  engineers  employed  from   foreign

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, construction work has not much attraction for

Singaporeans.    Unless  the Government thoroughly  changes  its

policy,   like  last  year's  large-scale  incentives  for   the

employers  to  employ skilled workers, it will not  be  easy  to

change  the local workers' present attitude of fighting  shy  of

the  construction  industry.  At the same  time,  the  levy  for

unskilled  workers will be raised to $470 with effect  from  1st

April.  Other than increasing the construction cost, it will not

have much encouraging effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that when the Government was formulating this

policy it was considering the need to attain budget neutrality.

However, from 1st April onwards,  when the new rates take

effect, so long as the number of skilled workers is lower than

15% of the total number of construction workers, the

Government's income in foreign worker levy will be increased,

and not neutral.  According to the statistics of the

Construction Industry Development Board  (CIDB), at the moment,

skilled foreign workers who are paying the foreign worker levy

account for approximately 10% of the total number of foreign

construction workers in Singapore.  Since the new policy on

foreign worker levy was announced at the end of last year, and

although the Singapore Construction Industry Training School has

increased the number of its  courses, it will be impossible to

rapidly raise the percentage within a short period of time.  In

any event,  so long as the Government's income is increased,

then the wool must still come from the back of the sheep - the

cost in the property sector will surely go up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this present economic turmoil where business is bad, all

the  trades and industries are asking for reduction in taxes and

rents,  and  the construction industry is also hoping  for  some

concessions.   All  these  years,   the  Government   has   been

collecting   more  than  $100 million a year  from  the  foreign

workers  levy.  However, there are more and more foreign workers

coming to Singapore.  This merely indicates an  increase in  the

Government's revenue from the foreign worker levy, and  not  the

best  plan to improve productivity.   I hope that the Government

would  respond  to  the public's request  not  to  increase  the

foreign worker levy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the Government and the

construction  companies are actively advocating the  concept  of

"builderbility".  In the past two to three years,  this  concept

has  been  extensively affirmed.  The concept of "builderbility"

is  mainly to encourage the top-level people in the construction

industry,  such  as   the  developers  and  the  architects,  to

actively consider, during the project design concept stage,  the

various problems of "builderbility" at the construction stage in

order  that  the contractors may effectively make  use  of  more

machines and less workers to complete the project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government speeds up the legislation process to

promote this concept of "builderbility", coupled with the slight

revision to the foreign workers levy,  I believe productivity in

the  construction industry can be significantly improved in  the

near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second topic is on foreign domestic maids. At the

present   moment,  the  Government's  policy  is  to   encourage

housewives to rejoin the workforce.  The Ministry of Labour  has

specially formulated a "back-to-work" scheme, with the hope that

more housewives would receive some training on the latest skills

and  some  psychological  preparation  before  they  rejoin  the

workforce.   I  fully  agree with this  policy.   However,  with

effect from 1st  April, the levy on foreign domestic maids  will

be increased once again.  Does this not run contradictory to the

above policy?  At the moment, with the economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



slowdown,  wages are not increased but the expenses will  surely

go  up  with the upward adjustment of loan interests and charges

from  the various departments.  For example, instalment payments

for  housing and vehicle loans, and utilities charges have  gone

up.  Although the additional $15 on the foreign maid levy can be

offset  by  cutting down on sundry consumption  expenses,   this

will affect the entire retail industry, causing the market to be

even more depressed.  Moreover, the Government has announced the

extension of retirement age, and now it is going to increase the

foreign  maid  levy.    The Government intends  to  improve  the

quality   of  childcare  centres.    This  will  not   only   be

ineffective,  but  may even end up with a blunder,  causing  the

psychological burden of the people to be heavier  at  this  time

when everyone is on tenterhooks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can be circumspect and farsighted,

and  not to further  increase the unskilled foreign workers levy

and the foreign maid levy after 1st April.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

also wish to talk about the run away of foreign maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some voters came to me to seek assistance in

appealing  against the forfeiture of  security bonds  for  their

foreign maids or workers who had run away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family employed a foreign maid to help look after their

aged parents and parents-in-law at home.  When the couple came

home from work, they found that their maid was missing.  They

could not get help from anywhere. Even the police would not help

them because the police do not deal with such matters unless the

absconded maid has overstayed in Singapore.  Even if the

employer knows the whereabouts of the maid, there is no

organisation  he can turn to to get the maid home. With the maid

running away, the employer has to apply for no-pay leave to look

after his aged parents and parent-in-law.  The moment the

Immigration Department comes to know about it, the employer will

be asked to surrender the maid to the authority for

repatriation,  failing which the security bond of $5,000 will be

forfeited.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the newly formed Ministry of Manpower will render

some  assistance to these employers.  Give them a  grace  period

before  forfeiting their security bond of $5,000,  unless  there

are compelling reasons why the grace period cannot be granted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there

is  a  Chinese fable which runs like this.  There was a mountain

in  front  of the house where an old man was living.  It  caused

the  old man a lot of inconvenience because every time he wanted

to  go  to town, he had to go round the mountain.  One  day,  he

decided  that  this mountain had to be removed.  His  neighbours

asked  him, "Is it possible? The mountain is so high."  The  old

man  replied, "Yes.  Although the mountain is high, it does  not

grow  any  higher. So long as  my children, their  children  and

their  children's  children persevere,  this  mountain  will  be

removed  one day".  The moral of this story is, "if there  is  a

will, there is a way."    This old man may not be clever, but he

is certainly not stupid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may ask, "What has this got to do with our topic

today?"    Well, the unemployment problem is just the  mountain.

If  we  want  to achieve full employment, we have to remove  the

obstacle, this mountain.  The  difference is: once the  mountain

is removed, it will not come back, but unemployment will.   Full

employment is difficult to achieve.  To sustain it is even  more

difficult.   As economic reform gathers momentum,  job  creation

alone cannot guarantee that the state of full employment will be

sustained.   In  this  regard, MTI  alone  cannot  shoulder  the

responsibility  all by itself.  It will have to work  in  tandem

with the new Ministry of Manpower to upgrade the skill level  of

the  workforce.   Challenges are plenty.  We  have  to  get  our

priorities right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three recommendations for the consideration of the

Ministry of Manpower.  Firstly, enhance the workers'

employability; secondly, remove all prejudices against the older

workers; and thirdly, enhance the competitiveness of the

professionals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>First  Priority:  Three groups of workers need  to  enhance

their employability</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the industrial and commercial restructuring, the

basic  skill  requirements of the workers  are  gradually  being

raised.  Workers with a primary educational level and below  are

already  facing  the threat of being eliminated.   In  the  next

three  to five years' time, if they do not upgrade the level  of

their  skills, they will be structurally unemployable.  This  is

the first group of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group of workers are those with Secondary 4

education,  who  are  either  unskilled  or  semi-skilled.    As

companies   are  accelerating  their  process  of  restructuring

because  of  competition, there will be more  opportunities  for

promotion. If the workers do not upgrade their skills, they will

miss  these promotion opportunities.  On the other hand, certain

industries will be short of skilled workers and  have to be over-dependent  on  foreign workers, resulting in  structural  under-employment.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our low value-added industry has contracted and thousands

of  workers in this industry are being laid off.  On  the  other

hand,  the high value-added industry is booming, but it is faced

with a shortage of workers.  If we fail to enable our workers to

upgrade  their skills and to move them from the low  value-added

industry  to  the high value-added industry, then they  will  be

faced  with the situation of structural  unemployment.  This  is

the third group of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these three situations become a reality, it would imply

that we have not fully utilised the potential of our workers  in

Singapore.   The tripartite cooperation among labour, management

and  the  Government should try their best  to  avoid  paying  a

higher price in these situations.

<br><br><i>Second Priority: Remove all prejudices against the older workers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aging of our population is an unavoidable fact. The

number of our workers who are above the age of  40 has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



now  exceeded 750,000.  A fortnight ago, within one  week  there

were  330 recruitment advertisements and half of them stipulated

that  the  maximum age for eligible candidates was 35, and  one-third of them wanted only people who were not more than 40 years

of  age.  In other words, 85% of the companies would accept only

applicants  who were below 40 years old.  If we do  not  correct

such  prejudice against the older workers, a vicious cycle  will

emerge and it can  become a serious social problem.

<br><br><i>Third Priority: Enhancing the competitiveness of our professionals</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value chain of our economic activities can be divided

into   upper,  upper-middle,  lower-middle  and  lower  streams.

"Upper  stream"  refers  to R&D; "lower  stream"  covers  market

development; "upper-middle" calls for creativity and innovation;

while "lower-middle" refers to mass production.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While pursuing the upper stream activities, such as R&D, we

must   always   emphasise  the  importance  of  creativity   and

innovation and market development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With comprehensive professional capabilities and equal

emphasis on the abovementioned four streams, we will be able  to

build  up  a  world-class workforce and turn  ourselves  into  a

global   hub   for  Asia.   Although  we  have  sound   economic

fundamentals, we have to continue to excel and strive ahead.  If

MTI   and  MOM  could  work  closely  together  to  create  more

opportunities for good jobs, while at the same time upgrade  our

workers' skills and the competitiveness of the professionals, we

will be able to ride out such economic storm and better position

ourselves for the next century in Asia as well as the world.  We

believe  we will be able to find an economic niche for ourselves

in the next century.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, according to the

latest Labour Force Survey, there are about 53,000 married women

who  have  indicated that they want to go  back  to  work.   The

majority have young children.  This is the major reason why they

could  not take up normal, full-time jobs.  Unlike the situation

in most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



developed countries, our women do not re-enter the workforce  in

their  later  years, after their child-rearing years  are  over.

The participation rate for women aged 40 to 50 years is only 52%

compared  to  71%  in Japan, 76% in US, and 70%  in  the  United

Kingdom.   For  those  aged 50 years and  above,  only  41%  are

economically active in Singapore compared to 66% in  Japan,  57%

in the US and 52% in the UK.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a huge pool to tap from, it is a great pity that

we are still relying heavily on foreign workers.  And now we are

talking about attracting more foreign talents.  It is time  that

we  took stock of our own existing resources and see how best we

could  develop them.  We must try to do much more  not  only  to

attract  such  women into the workforce but also try  to  retain

those who are already in the workforce.  If we look at countries

with  high female labour force participation rates, we will also

find that there are many flexible work arrangements that are  in

place  to help women balance work and family.  I think  they  do

not want to depend on foreign maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key element of these work arrangements is flexibility.

This  comes  in the form of flexible working time,  job-sharing,

part-time  work or home-based work, or work located  near  their

homes.  With the vast improvements in telecommunications,  there

is  no  need even for women to leave their homes.  With a little

planning,  many  jobs  can  be  converted  to  home-based  work.

Journalism  is one example, as the primary tools of a journalist

are a laptop and a telephone which do not require them to be  in

the office all the time.  Vast opportunities can be created,  if

only  employers are prepared to be flexible and  spend  time  to

redesign  their  jobs.   Singapore Post is  one  example  of  an

employer  who  did  a  marvellous job in bringing  work  to  the

doorsteps  of women.  Instead of depending on male postmen,  now

they have housewives to distribute letters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from flexible work arrangements, we find that where

there   are   adequate  community  facilities   and   pro-family

incentives,  in the form of tax incentives or child care  leave,

the  labour force participation rate increases.  In Sweden,  for

instance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



either  parent  could take up to 15 months of child  care  leave

with  full pay for the first three months and 75% of the  salary

for  the  remaining period.  Whilst I am not suggesting that  we

follow  the  Swedish  example,  it nevertheless  highlights  the

importance  attached  to child caring and the  reason  why  many

Swedish  women could go back to work after their leave is  over.

We  could  perhaps adopt more modest measures.  Employers  could

consider  allowing women to take unpaid leave, after their  paid

maternity  leave  is  over, for another six months.   Presently,

this scheme is found only in the public sector which gives up to

one  year's  leave, but is almost non-existent  in  the  private

sector.  Employers who provide pro-family benefits could even be

given  tax  incentives  and subsidised assistance  from  PSB  to

redesign jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many women also need training, both in raising their skill

level  and  developing  their self-confidence  to  re-enter  the

workforce.    With  the  new  Ministry  of  Manpower,   a   more

coordinated  strategy for the development, training and  funding

of  such programmes would hopefully be in place.  At the end  of

the  day,  what  we  hope  to achieve  is  to  help  women  lead

meaningful lives and contribute to society by allowing  them  to

balance family and work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I continue with my amendment on CPF?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Yu-Foo, I think the Minister would like

to reply now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, allow me to, first, reply to the

points raised by the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin, Dr Lily Neo.

She has observed that according to the Department of Statistics'

data, the income ratio between male and female declined from 73%

in  1990  to  59% in 1995.  I would like to point out  that  the

Department of Statistics' findings reflected the income  of  the

total  workforce, which included all the foreign  workers.   The

statistics,  therefore,  has  been  somewhat  distorted  by  the

increasing number of lowly-paid female foreign domestic  workers

over the years.  To better reflect the trend, we should look  at

the  wage  data  of  our  resident workforce.   These  data  are

captured in the occupational wages survey, CPF Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



earnings data and Labour Force Survey data.  These data are  for

resident workforce and they have, in fact, shown a narrowing  of

the  overall  wage  gap between resident males  and  females  in

Singapore  over the years.  For instance, based on CPF  records,

the average monthly earning of resident females rose from 68% in

1987  to  76% in 1997.  So, in fact, the gap is actually getting

narrower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors which could account for the wage gap include the

differences  in job nature and job level, as well  as  years  of

service,  working experience and educational attainment  of  the

jobholders.   Statistics  from the latest  Labour  Force  Survey

showed  that female labour force participation peaked  at  82.4%

for the 25 to 29 age group, and thereafter declined, as was also

observed  yesterday by Mdm Claire Chiang.  These data, in  fact,

suggest  that  women  tend to drop out of  the  workforce  after

marriage  to  take  care  of the family  responsibility.   As  a

result,  the  average years of service and experience  of  women

remaining in the workforce will naturally be shorter compared to

their male counterparts, consequently their wage levels will  be

lowered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, discrimination in employment exists only when persons

of  equal capability doing the same jobs are paid differently by

the  same  employer  on factors unrelated to their  performance.

Hence,   we   must  understand  the  basis  for   the   national

occupational wage data and not conclude that there is  indeed  a

discrimination on basis of gender or that women, in general, are

being disadvantaged.  This is because the occupational wage data

are  based on the aggregate of similar jobs, regardless  of  the

level  of  authority,  job complexity,  responsibility  or  work

experience.  In Singapore, women who do the same job as men  are

paid  the same wages as men.  This is clearly reflected  in  the

practice  of  the public sector when men and women in  the  same

position,  with  the  same years of service,  receive  the  same

remuneration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin has also raised many

other  issues  relating to the difficulties  of  the  challenges

facing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



women in employment, including the difficulty of balancing  work

with  family  responsibility and also  the  general  mindset  of

employers  with  regard to the role of women in  the  workplace.

These  are  relevant  issues.  These will  have  to  be  studied

further.   Yesterday  I mentioned that my Ministry  had  already

appointed  an Advisory Committee to our Back-to-Work  programme,

and this Committee would, in fact, look at some of these issues.

And  I  will  certainly  convey the  Member's  concerns  to  the

Committee so that they could be considered in totality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a tight labour market, as what we have been

experiencing all these years, employers have to be innovative in

order to recruit the workers that they need, and they should not

omit the potential of recruiting more women workers to join  the

workforce.    I  think  we  can  satisfy  some  of  our   labour

requirements if we make a special effort to recruit more of  the

women  who  are  presently not working to rejoin the  workforce.

And, in fact, this is the main thrust and target of our Back-to-Work  programme.   The  Ministry of Manpower  will  continue  to

develop this programme to enlarge its outreach, so that it  will

be more effective in getting the women back into the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to the Members who spoke on foreign

workers,  in  particular  the foreign worker  levy.   First,  Mr

Inderjit  Singh has asked whether the lower levy  which  we  are

granting to skilled workers, with effect from 1st April, will be

extended  to  workers from all sources.  Yes, I  would  like  to

assure  Mr  Singh that, in fact, the lower levy  which  will  be

pegged at $100 per month will be extended to foreign workers  in

all sectors and from all sources, including skilled workers from

the non-traditional sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to address the point raised by Mr Magad

and  Mr  Chuang  on reducing the foreign worker levy.   Firstly,

both  Mr  Magad and Mr Chuang have suggested to defer  the  levy

increase for foreign domestic workers.  This was the increase of

$15  which  we  announced in November last year.  It  will  take

effect  on  1st  April.   Sir, I want  to  point  out  that  the

adjustment is on account of changes in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



income  levels  of  Singaporean employers  of  foreign  domestic

workers,  and  also because of the increase in foreign  domestic

workers, since the last levy revision in 1995. The levy increase

is  necessary  to  ensure that the cost of employing  a  foreign

domestic   worker  keeps  pace  with  the  rise  in  income   of

Singaporeans.  Otherwise, the number will continue  to  increase

and it will reach unmanageable proportions.  As it stands, there

are  already  more  than  100,000 foreign  domestic  workers  in

Singapore.   If  we  do  not implement any measure  to  moderate

demand, the number could increase much drastically.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, real income level, as measured by the average monthly

income  for Singaporeans, rose by 9% cumulatively for  1995  and

1996.   And  if  you  compare this to the proposed  increase  in

foreign domestic levy which is only 4�% increase, this seems  to

be  totally reasonable.  In fact, it means even if income growth

were to be slower this year because of the slow economic growth,

the foreign domestic workers have already become relatively more

affordable compared to 1995 when the levy was last revised.   If

we  defer the levy increase this year, it will hamper efforts to

control or to moderate the rising demand.  As the  intention  is

to  increase the levy to keep pace with rising income, we should

make  this  adjustment regularly so that it is a small increase,

small  steps,  along the way, rather than defer  it  for  a  few

years.   Then a few years down the road, we would have to  bring

in  a  very  hefty  increase  which  would  lead  to  even  more

unhappiness and greater difficulties for the families to adjust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Chuang's call to defer the increase in levy for

the  unskilled  foreign construction workers, I  would  like  to

point out to the Member that, despite the economic slowdown  and

the  Ministry's announcement of the impending levy increase, the

demand  for  work  permit  applications  for  unskilled  foreign

construction  workers is still very strong.   And  we  are  also

seeing an increasing number of these foreign workers being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



deployed  to  work  illegally in other  sectors,  such  as  food

establishments and cleansing work.  This has obviously distorted

the demand for construction workers.  The levy increase, coupled

with  enforcement  measures and the new work  permit  allocation

system,  is  necessary to curb the rising  number  of  unskilled

foreign  construction  workers and  to  tackle  the  problem  of

construction workers working illegally in other sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foreign construction workers have contributed, as Mr

Chuang  pointed out, to the bulk of our construction  workforce.

In  fact,  foreign construction workers also contribute  to  the

bulk  of the increase in foreign workers, from more than 350,000

in  early  1996  to more than 450,000 currently.   Most  of  the

increase  came from the unskilled foreign construction  workers.

The  heavy dependence on unskilled foreign construction  workers

is  not sustainable economically and socially in the long run if

we want to remain competitive.  The negative productivity growth

in  the  construction  sector for the last three  years  clearly

illustrates how the heavy dependence on foreign unskilled labour

had  retarded the growth of the industry.  One indicator of  the

low level of the construction industry here in Singapore is seen

in  the  fact  that only 14% of the workforce are considered  as

skilled  workers.  In other words, they are on the  current  low

levy  scheme  for skilled workers.  In other countries,  with  a

much  more productive and efficient construction industry, there

are  many  more  skilled workers.  For instance,  in  Australia,

skilled workers represent 40% of the construction workforce;  in

Finland, 60% of the construction workforce.  They have  so  many

more  skilled workers.  They are so much more productive.   They

need  in  total  fewer  workers  to  meet  the  demand  of   the

construction industry there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I also want to point out that having a low

level  and  unproductive construction industry totally dependent

on   large  numbers  of  unskilled  and  inexperienced   foreign

construction  workers  has  also  resulted  in  high  rates   of

accidents at construction sites.  These people come to Singapore

to work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



without  any  experience and training and very often,  they  are

involved in unnecessary work site accident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have provided an alternative to contractors. If they

have  difficulty  meeting the higher levy from  1st  April  this

year,  they  should  make  greater efforts  to  recruit  skilled

workers or send the existing workers for some training and trade

testing  so that they can qualify for the lower levy,  which  is

$100.   I  have to stress that the levy saving for each  skilled

worker  is more than 12 times the levy increase for an unskilled

worker.  So it is well worth the while of the contractor to make

a  special effort to bring in a skilled worker or to upgrade the

skills of the existing workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our announcement since November last year had already

started  to take effect.  Since the announcement, we  have  been

seeing  more contractors sending their workers for training  and

trade  testing at the construction industry training  institute.

This  is  a  very good trend.  It should be encouraged.   If  we

defer the levy increase, the trend might reverse itself and  the

contractors  could  well  go  back  to  the  past  practice   of

recruiting  more  and  more unskilled  workers.   Therefore,  my

Ministry  has decided to proceed with the levy increase  on  1st

April.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to the Member that in fact in

reviewing the foreign worker policy, budget neutrality is really

not  a  factor.   Overall, our revision of  the  foreign  worker

policy that was announced in November last year, will result  in

a  levy  saving to employers of more than $200 million  a  year,

both   in   the   manufacturing  sector,  service   sector   and

construction  industry.  There is a potential to  have  enormous

levy  savings.  And in fact, if contractors move to recruit more

skilled  workers  and  put them on a lower  levy  of  $100,  the

savings  would be far more than the $200 million  that  we  have

estimated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Goh Choon Kang and Mr Ong Ah Heng both spoke on the

problems  faced by employers of foreign domestic  workers  whose

domestic workers run away from their homes.  I think all Members

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



aware  and  the employers of foreign domestic workers  are  also

aware  that they have to post a security bond, which is  $5,000.

The  security  bond is a safeguard to ensure that the  employers

take  full  responsibility for their foreign workers,  including

foreign domestic workers, and that they repatriate these foreign

workers  when  their  contract or  work  permit  expires.   This

condition  is made very clear to each and every applicant  of  a

foreign  worker,  including the applicants of  foreign  domestic

workers.   It is the responsibility that the employers  have  to

factor  into  their  decision  in employing  a  foreign  worker.

Without the security bond, the employers may not exercise proper

management and supervision on their foreign workers resulting in

more  missing foreign workers and creating more social problems.

Furthermore,  we may even see the emergence of another  problem,

namely,  employers  wilfully abandoning their  foreign  workers.

Because  if they have no obligation to repatriate their  foreign

workers, if they do not have to post a security bond or  if  the

security bond will not be forfeited, then they may just  abandon

their  workers to their own devices and say, "You find your  own

way around."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of cases of missing foreign domestic workers is

small,  considering  that there are more than  100,000  of  them

working in Singapore currently.  To date, the cumulative  number

of  foreign domestic workers who have gone missing is only about

500  compared  to the several hundred thousand foreign  domestic

workers  who have worked in Singapore over the last 20 years  or

so.   So on balance, we should retain the system of the security

bond.   There  is no reason for us to change the  security  bond

requirement.   It has worked well.  It has kept  the  number  of

such cases and abuses of foreign workers down to a minimum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked what assistance or advice my Ministry

would give to employers when their domestic workers go AWOL.   I

would  like  to  advise employers to promptly  inform  the  Work

Permit  Department when their foreign workers run away from  the

homes.  They can also seek assistance from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



employment agency which brought in the foreign domestic  workers

in the first instance and also check with the respective Embassy

because,  very  often, these domestic workers would  go  to  the

Embassy to complain or to report their grievances they may  have

with   the   employers.   When  they  inform  the  Work   Permit

Department,  we  will allow the employers  to  cancel  the  work

permit  and give them time to locate the foreign workers without

having to pay the foreign worker levy during the interim.   They

can  in  fact  also  apply  for a new  foreign  domestic  worker

thereafter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will exercise flexibility with regard to the bonds. We

are  not going to forfeit the bond immediately.  In general,  we

will  give  the employers a grace period of up to a month  after

the cancellation of the work permit to try to locate the foreign

workers.   Even  after the security bond has been  forfeited,  a

refund  can  still  be  considered if  some  months  later,  the

employer can provide some information or assistance which  leads

towards the repatriation of the run away domestic worker.  So we

are  fairly generous and we understand the difficulties of  some

of the employers and we will try to help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang suggested a foreign labour fund. He

suggested that 20% of the workers' wages should go towards  this

fund  which  would  then be paid back to the workers  when  they

leave the country.  I would like to point out that, as it stands

today, there is nothing to stop an employer of a foreign worker,

whether  he is a worker in the construction sector or a  foreign

domestic worker, to strike up a contract with the foreign worker

that  if  he  completes his term of contract for two  years,  or

whatever  it  is, he will be paid a contract gratuity  and  this

contract  gratuity will represent so many percent of  the  wages

that he earns over a period of time.  This is entirely possible.

But  I would advise employers that if they want to do this,  the

contract  gratuity should be clearly spelt out in their contract

of  service with the foreign worker so that in future there will

be  no  argument about unlawful salary deduction  or  retention.

This  would  meet the objectives spelt out by Mr Goh.   It  will

ensure that the foreign worker stays on to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



the  end  of  the contract, completes the contract properly  and

then  collects  his  contract  gratuity  before  he  leaves  the

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say raised several points about ensuring

employability,  particularly of the lower educated  workers  and

problems  faced with reskilling the lower skilled  workers,  and

also the need to look at the redeployment of workers as they get

dislocated  from  one sector, for instance, manufacturing,  into

another  sector.   I  would say that I agree entirely  with  the

views  of Mr Lim.  I think these are valid issues which must  be

considered and we must not take the full employment that we have

enjoyed  since  the  1970s for granted.  I think  we  were  very

fortunate  that  we  had  been able to achieve  steady  economic

growth  and to maintain full employment over such a long period.

Our  current economic slowdown is in fact a timely reminder that

we  cannot  take full employment and steady economic growth  for

granted.  It is also a timely reminder that the problems of  our

neighbours can very well become our problems too.  As  a  result

of  the currency crisis and the economic slowdown in the region,

we  are  likely to see slower growth this year and retrenchments

are  likely to rise as the regional crisis takes its  toll.   So

the  Ministry will adopt a proactive approach to quickly address

the  threat of structural unemployment or retrenched workers  as

well as the long-term employability issue mentioned by Mr Lim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I have already explained the roles,

responsibilities and priorities of the Ministry of Manpower come

April  this year.  I will not repeat these points other than  to

emphasise  that  MOM  will  work  closely  with  our  tripartite

partners to achieve our vision of a world class workforce and to

ensure that Singaporeans gain a higher level of skills to remain

employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think ensuring lifelong employability for our workers

will  have to be a key priority of the new Ministry.   We  would

have  to  work  on new initiatives and invest more resources  in

order  to  achieve this level of skills training and retraining.

So MOM will endeavour to put in place a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



system  for  continuing  education  and  training  for  all  our

workers,  whether they are young or old, unskilled  or  skilled,

including  even  those  who are better educated.   Every  worker

needs  to continuously upgrade his skills to be relevant to  the

changing needs of the industries.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to the Member for Bukit Timah, Mrs Yu-Foo

Yee Shoon, who commented on the need to promote flexible or part-time  work, particularly for women who have to balance the needs

of the family and their career.  Sir, the promotion of part-time

and  flexible arrangement is very important, given our objective

to increase the labour force participation of married women aged

30  to  54, because this is the age group of women where we  are

seeing   a   very   rapidly  declining   female   labour   force

participation rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part-time flexible work and teleworking, which has

been  mentioned by the Member, are all viable options that would

enable  women to balance their family needs with a  career.   In

the  1997  Labour Force Survey, half of the 37,700  economically

inactive  persons,  who  indicated  that  they  wanted  to  seek

employment  within the next two years, said that they  preferred

part-time work.  I think that was why in 1996, we formulated the

part-time   employees  regulations  to  provide  a   legislative

framework   to   facilitate  the  creation  of  more   part-time

employment.   These  regulations  spell  out  the   rights   and

obligations  of employers and part-time employees,  and  provide

flexibility  in  terms of encashing certain statutory  benefits.

However,   part-time  employment  is  still  not  prevalent   in

Singapore  and  constitutes only 3% of employment in  Singapore.

So there is still a lot of room for improvement and we will make

greater  efforts in order to promote this idea  of  having  more

part-time  jobs  or  flexible work schedules,  particularly  for

women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity and Standards Board is, in fact, planning

a job redesign programme.  This job redesign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



programme will provide a framework for organisations to  enhance

productivity in continuous work process improvement  and  skills

upgrading, as well as to help organisations address the issue of

manpower  shortage and an aging workforce.  Under the programme,

basic job redesign models will be developed by consultants hired

for  this purpose.  And once the models are developed,  we  will

share  them  with employers so that they can help  employers  to

restructure  the  jobs  in  their workplace.   The  models  will

certainly  include options for part-time employment  and  flexi-work  arrangements.  The Ministry of Manpower will work  closely

with PSB in order to promote this programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah also mentioned the example of

Sweden  where  many women are able to work.  In  fact,  Sweden's

female  labour force participation rate is almost equal  to  the

male  labour  force participation rate through the  various  age

groups,  suggesting that Swedish women do not withdraw from  the

workforce  upon reaching marriage or child bearing  age,  unlike

women  in Singapore.  Swedish women are able to enjoy, what  the

Member described, an excellent set of benefits to enable them to

stay  in  employment while at the same time  raising  a  family.

This support system, I must point out, is sustained by very high

tax  rates.  Therefore, the model s not wholly relevant  to  us.

And  for  Members'  interest, the level of  social  and  welfare

support  provided  by the Swedish government requires  extremely

high  tax revenues.  90% of the employees pay approximately  30%

of  their  salary in income tax, and the remaining  10%  of  the

employees pay more than 30% of their salary as taxes.  And  that

is  not the main source of the revenue for the state.  The  main

source of revenue for the state is, in fact, the 25% value-added

tax,  which  every  consumer pays.   With  such  high  rates  of

taxation,  they can afford to redistribute to all these  welfare

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, in Singapore, only 30% of individuals pay

income  tax.  70% do not pay income tax. According to the Inland

Revenue Authority of Singapore, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



effective tax rate in Singapore is only about 8.1% in 1997, 8.2%

in  1995  and  our  GST is only 3%.  So we are  looking  at  two

totally  different  systems.  While  they  may  have  some  good

points,  we should be careful about which are the ones  that  we

want to adopt and modify for our application in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that one

of  the problems facing women who want to take on part-time jobs

is  that employers do not have the right attitude towards  part-time  workers.  Very often, employers consider part-time workers

as  being  less  committed and less reliable.   They  see  their

employment  as being supplementary and transient in nature,  and

hence many employers are not prepared to hire part-time workers.

And if they do hire, they are not prepared to invest in training

or  upgrading  the skills of their part-time workers.   I  think

this mindset has to change, if we want to promote part-time  and

flexible  work  arrangements.  Employers have to be  more  open,

more innovative, as I said earlier on, with regard to attracting

workers, particularly women, back into the workforce.  They have

to  accept  that some women would only want to take on part-time

jobs  and they will be equally committed, equally dedicated  and

equally reliable compared to  full-time workers.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Sir, I want to touch on CPF policy.

My  concern  is  that CPF originally started off  as  a  pension

scheme  catering for the retirement needs of Singaporeans.   But

today,  we  use it for housing, medical care and even education.

More  recently, CPF could even be used for investments in stocks

and  shares.   I  would like to ask the Minister  what  are  the

average  balances  in  the  ordinary  and  special  accounts  of

members,  and  whether  the  Ministry  considers  such   amounts

sufficient  to  meet  the  needs of  the  average  workers  upon

retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is that, lately, we also give the

flexibility for CPF members to invest their CPF funds.  I  would

like to say that there is a need to educate CPF members who  are

ignorant of the mechanism of the stock market.  There should  be

more safeguards so that CPF savings are not excessively exposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, Mrs Yu-Foo is concerned whether CPF

savings are adequate, especially for the older CPF members.  I

would like to quickly point out that low CPF balances of older

CPF members is the result of low wages and low CPF contribution

rate in past years.  While this may be inevitable and actually

reflects the gradual growth of our economy, we, as  a

Government, have launched various efforts to help older CPF

members to build up their CPF savings.  Examples are the CPF Top-Up Scheme, Pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme and Minimum Sum Top-Up

Scheme for both spouse and parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the net CPF savings have

actually  been  increasing over the years.   For  instance,  the

median  net balance, which is the total CPF savings less savings

committed for investments in property or stocks and shares,  for

those  who turned 55 in 1995 was about $45,000.   For those  who

turned  55  in  1997,  the median net balance  had  gone  up  to

$52,000, an increase of about $7,000 over the two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I also want to point out that all of a

member's  CPF  assets  including the cash in  the  CPF  account,

property, insurance and investments are available for  old  age,

not just the cash component.  We cannot just look at what is the

net  balance and say, "Is this adequate?"  We must look  at  the

total  CPF portfolio.  For instance, investments under  the  CPF

investment  scheme  can  be easily converted  into  cash.    The

shares  can  be liquidated or sold and the cash can be  used  to

meet  the needs of the retired members.  Furthermore, a  retired

CPF  member can also sell off, for instance, a 5-room  flat  and

then  move to a smaller 3-room flat to free up cash to meet  his

needs  for  daily  expenses.  And if we look  at  the  regrossed

balance  of  members who turned 55 in 1997, 70% of them  already

have balances which exceed the current minimum sum of $50,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Younger CPF members should be able to save up sufficiently

to  meet their basic needs when they retire.  For instance,  the

median net balance in the ordinary and special accounts for  the

younger workers between 45 and 55 years is already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



$47,000.   And  the regrossed balance is, in fact, much  higher,

about $100,000 for CPF members in the same age group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by the year 2003, when the minimum sum scheme will

reach  its target of $80,000 with $40,000 in the cash component,

about  80% of the active CPF members would be able to  meet  the

minimum sum requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked about the CPF investment scheme.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the latest measures announced by the Minister

on  ERP are much to be welcomed.  The Government announced  five

principles  which  will be the basis for the new  vehicular  tax

structure.  These five principles are: first, charging  on  road

usage;   second, charging based on three factors -  charging  on

the  use of road space, damage to the road and the progressivity

factor;  third,  tax  concession to taxis and  scheduled  buses;

fourth,  rationalise existing structure; and, fifth, to maintain

revenue neutrality globally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to examine the new charge system for motorcycles,

which  I  think is not very fair.  We are told that a motorcycle

is 0.5 pcu (passenger car unit), when a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



normal  private car is 1, similar for a taxi and a  light  goods

vehicle.   A bus, for example, has a pcu of between  1.5-2.    A

car entering the gantry at the East Coast Parkway from 1st April

1998 will have to pay $1 from 7.30 am to 8.00 am, compared to  a

fee  of 50 cents for the two-wheel motorcycle, which has  a  pcu

rating  of  0.5.   A  two-wheel vehicle, such as  a  motorcycle,

should  proportionally cause less damage to the  road,  compared

with  a four-wheel vehicle, in addition to the fact that it  is,

of  course, half the size.  Should not the rate for a  two-wheel

vehicle  be less than 25 cents?  At that rate, it would  be  the

same  as  a  light goods vehicle which is charged at  25  cents.

Also, presumably because they are used for business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorcyclists also go to town a lot in the course of

business.  And if we were to factor in the progressivity element

and  rank  the ordinal scale of charge, I would put it  at  less

than  that  of  a LGV, and definitely less than that  of  taxis.

However, in the present scheme as proposed, the charges for  the

motorcyclists  are  higher than the taxis and  the  light  goods

vehicles,  at  off peak and peak hours.  I think this  is  quite

unfair.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I must commend the

Minister for Communications for  the implementation of  the  ERP

system.  I think the ground has been well prepared and also  the

justification for ERP has been made fairly well known.   I  have

no   complaints  about  the  charges  and  there  have  been  no

criticisms  of  the ERP charges that will be  implemented.   The

charge  proposed for cars from 7.30 am to 8.00 am is  $1.   From

<br>8.00 am to 9.00 am, it is a $2 charge, a doubling of the charge.

From 9.00 am to 9.30 am, it is $1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this very large jump from 8.00 am onwards will lead to

an  uneven and non-smooth flow of traffic.  We all know  of  the

current  CBD  and ECP charges.  When there is a charge,  drivers

slow  down  in  order  to avoid paying the  charge.    And  some

drivers  actually park their cars by the side  of  the  road  in

order to make sure that they  get in at the correct time.  So if

we  have  this jump from $1 to $2 at 8 o'clock, then the drivers

will slow down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



their cars and traffic becomes uneven.  And marginally, the  few

minutes  before eight o'clock, what will happen  is  that  there

will  be  very light traffic because cars will not be sure  that

they  will meet the eight o'clock deadline.  There will be  very

few  cars  going  in just before eight o'clock.   So  those  few

minutes  before eight o'clock will be quite crucial when drivers

will slow down.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the system is electronic, I suggest to the Minister

that he should look into the smoothening of the charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, let me give an illustration. If there are

intermediate  charges before 8 am and there are  more  intervals

for  charges,  traffic  will smoothen out.   There  could  be  a

compromise of the peak charge.  Instead of 8 am, maybe it  could

be  delayed  to, say, 8.15 am.  So we may have a  charge  system

like  7.30  am to 7.45 am, $1 charge; 7.45 am to 8 am,  say,  at

$1.25; 8 am to 8.15 am, $1.50; 8.15 am to 9 am, a peak charge of

$2 or some combination of these charges.  If we can do that, the

traffic  flow would be much smoother.  Since the system has  not

been  implemented  yet,  I urge the Minister  to  consider  this

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I have to make on the ERP is that the

process  of  planning for ERP has been going on for  nearly  two

years  and what we see as a result in the implementation of  the

ERP  is that there are several gantry points sprouting all  over

Singapore  island.  Although a lot of tests have  been  done  on

this  system,  we have looked at the functional  aspects  and  I

think  we  miss out on form.  The archways look very  unsightly,

and  to  make it worse, at the CBD gantry points, we  have  more

than  one gantry steel structure.  Is it not possible to combine

the CBD and ERP gantry points?  They look so unsightly.  This is

especially  so  in  the case of the CBD  as  this  is  the  main

approach to our city centre.  Visitors coming to Singapore  will

not  understand  why a nice and beautiful city  has  these  very

unsightly steel structures.

<br><br><!-- Mr R Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the ERP

scheme,  the first of its kind in the world, reflects  not  only

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



Government's  ability  to  create a  world-class  transportation

infrastructure,  but  also its ability to set  world  standards.

But  in every conquest, in every pinnacle of achievement,  there

will inevitably be teething implementation problems that need to

be resolved and the ERP is no exception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, for the normal motorists, the Ministry

intends  to allow the use of Cashcard but not the NETS  card  or

the  credit  card  for  ERP payment.  Presumably,  the  argument

against  allowing  the  use of NETS  or  credit  cards  is  that

confidential information about the motorist and the  whereabouts

of his car could be tracked by the authority and, therefore, the

public could be unhappy about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think, this may be a fallacy. Let me explain.

There  are  a number of problems that can occur with  Cashcards.

For  example,  the  drivers can end up with  fines  because  the

Cashcards, as luck might have it, may not be topped up  in  time

with  sufficient cash.  I can say with confidence that, using  a

rule  of  thumb, 80% to 90% of the drivers would prefer  to  use

their  NETS  or credit cards for ERP payments as  it  would  not

really matter to most of them if the authorities do track  their

movements.   In  fact, Sir, the truth is, many  members  of  the

public have the perception that their movements would be tracked

anyway  even  with the use of Cashcards.  Sir, I  know  this  is

untrue  but that is a separate point.  My point, Sir,  is  maybe

less  than  10%  or 20% of the road users may prefer  to  ensure

confidentiality of their travels because they either attempt  to

cheat  their companies with false transport claims or  they  are

trying to cheat their spouse with false claim of where they went

or  for  some  other reasons of their own.   So  it  is  only  a

minority.   I would like to urge the LTA, particularly  the  LTA

officials,  the civil servants, to give motorists an  option  to

use the Cashcard or the NETS or credit cards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the day and age of e-commerce, which is central to our

national project, Singapore One, confidential information  would

be transferred through NETS and credit card transactions through

the Internet.  It is certainly the way we are heading towards.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether it is

technically  possible  for ERP gantry booths  and  IU  units  to

incorporate  the use of NETS or credit cards and,  if  so,  what

would  be the additional costs.  Would it be so exorbitant  that

the e-commerce through the NETS cannot handle?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also urge the Minister to consider

this  point.   The  Minister  is a  very  gentle  Minister.   He

listens,  so  does  his  MOS but I am not  sure  about  the  LTA

officials.   Just to make my point, last year  I  made  a  hard-hitting speech on the civil servants in the Environment Ministry

and their lack of effort in training the DREs.  After my speech,

a  lot of headway was made in the last one year, and today, I am

happy  that some of the senior civil servants in the Environment

Ministry  want  to  be  a  model Ministry  in  labour-management

relations.   I would be happy to nominate ENV for an LMR  Award.

So  the  scene  has changed, and I do not want to make  a  hard-hitting  speech  on  the  civil  servants  in  the  Ministry  of

Communications, but I hope  they will take this  in  a  positive

light.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the LTA officials to go to the

NETS  and  credit card companies with an open mind so that  ways

can  be  found  for motorists to use the roads with  a  peaceful

frame  of mind.  Sir, motorists would like to have a smooth  and

fine road journey without the fear of being fined.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like to

congratulate  the Minister for a very well thought-out  plan  on

road  management as represented by the Electronic  Road  Pricing

Scheme   and  the  accompanying  rebate  and  road  tax   reform

programme.   I would also like to congratulate the Minister  for

having  spent  much  time  and  effort  in  explaining  all  the

ramifications  of  the  plan  and  answering  all  the   various

questions  that  have  arisen, privately, publicly  and  in  the

media.   My  colleagues  and I on the GPC (Communications)  have

also  made  many queries and suggestions which the Minister  and

his  staff have forbearingly and patiently tolerated.   I  thank

the Minister for this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would forbear one more time for a

simple request.  There has been some anxiety about the safety of

the  in-vehicle unit used to pay ERP charges.  There  have  also

been  requests  to  reveal the details  of  the  tests  and  the

conditions  in  which they have been conducted.  I  suppose  the

people who have asked want to evaluate for themselves whether it

is  indeed  safe or not.  Above all, there have been queries  on

many  aspects  of  implementation and on the  operation  of  the

system.   As  these have appeared in various media and  fora  in

dribs and drabs at different times and different places, can the

Minister  consider  putting  these and  other  frequently  asked

questions (in Internet jargon, it is the FAQs) on their  website

or  some other websites dedicated to this topic and give us  the

URL, the address of this website, and then for those who are not

Internet  ready, to have these answers compiled and disseminated

in  hard  copy  brochures  and booklets  in  the  four  official

languages?  We would all be very grateful if the Minister  could

oblige.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my cut is on

Electronic  Road Pricing.  It was reported that  the  Electronic

Road Pricing system cameras erected in the ECP, the highways and

other  roads have shown to be very efficient in detecting  those

vehicles that cross the gantries.  The cameras there can produce

very  clear pictures of those vehicles who pass that way without

an  in-vehicle unit or Cashcard.  In fact, the system  has  been

described as foolproof by Mr Chin Kian Keong, LTA's Manager  for

Road Pricing.  This means that the Government shall have another

efficient  means  of collecting revenue.  In  the  eyes  of  the

Government,  the ERP system is to control vehicle use  but  from

the public's point of view, it is viewed more as a device set up

by  the Government to collect more revenue.  The Government  has

already set up a quota system.  When this quota system was first

implemented, it was touted as the ultimate system to control the

number  of cars on the roads.  This means that traffic jams  are

cut to a minimum and a desired number of cars is only allowed to

be used on the roads.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have an additional system to regulate the number of

vehicles   which  is  only  allowed  to  pass  certain   points,

purportedly which will not cause traffic jams.  But in the first

place,  we have already a system whereby the number of  vehicles

is  controlled to prevent or to cut down traffic jams.   So  the

question is: Will the quota system be eventually scrapped  since

we  have a new system? Otherwise, the quota system does not make

sense  at  all.  In the first place, you control the  number  of

cars and the Government says that this is the ultimate number of

cars  allowed  on  the roads.  Then you have another  system  to

control this number of cars which is supposedly allowed  on  the

roads  in  the first place.  So we either use one or  the  other

system, otherwise it does not make sense at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think I

can  tell Mr Chiam See Tong that the Government will not abolish

the  COE  because the COE is a steady source of income  for  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government claims that the purpose of implementing the

ERP is to ease the congestion on our roads.  It will also switch

from a fixed road tax system which taxes on ownership to that of

a  road  pricing system which taxes on usage.  Road tax  rebates

will  be  provided for the next five years,  and the  Government

claims  that  the  implementation of ERP will not  increase  its

revenue.   But  what will happen five years later when  no  more

road  tax  rebates  will be given?  With higher  ERP  fees,  the

Government's revenue will surely go up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing that we should know, that is, with

the  ERP system, whenever we use the road  we will have  to  pay

for  it,  like  GST.  You cannot escape from it.  On  the  other

hand, the Government is assured of a steady income, irrespective

of the economic situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the reason for the Government to

revise  the  various  tax  structures was  to  ensure  that  the

Government  will have a steady tax revenue irrespective  of  the

economic situation.  In recent years,  taxes on  motor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



vehicles  have  become an important source of  revenue  for  the

Government. For example, in last year's budget,  the  Government

expected  to collect more than $4 billion from COE, import  tax,

ARF, and  road tax.  However, apart from the road tax which is a

fixed income, revenues from the other taxes were affected by the

economic  downturn and the number of COEs the  Government  could

issue.    For  the financial year 1st April 1996 to  31st  March

1997,  the  Government's income from COE was $120  million  less

than  the  expected  amount.   On  ARF,  the  revenue  was  $174

million  less  than the expected amount.  For this  reason,  the

Government  says  it  is allowing more people  to  own  cars  by

issuing more COEs.  This would make up for the loss in the above

revenue.   At the same time, apart from the fixed road tax,  the

Government  is  now implementing the ERP system to  ensure  they

have a steady income.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the ERP will be

implemented  soon.   The implementation  of  the  ERP  has  been

explained very clearly.  And as we all know, the ERP is meant to

dissuade  excessive usage of the roads in the  areas  which  are

very  heavily  congested with traffic,  for  example,  CBD.   In

general, I do support the concept of the ERP.  There are certain

advantages  and disadvantages.  For myself and others  like  me,

who  have  to  use the CBD or CTE, I would say  that  it  is  an

advantage.  At the present moment, if you want to go there,  you

have  either  to  choose  between a daily  or  a  monthly  pass.

Therefore  you  have  to  make a detour  to  a  post  office  or

somewhere  which sells monthly pass and buy the pass.   If  not,

every  day,  you have to scout around for a booth, stop  by  the

booth  and buy the pass.  Sometimes, in a hurry, you may  forget

and  then you enter these areas inadvertently and end up with  a

fine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these people, who are probably the large majority of

those  who  use  these areas, I think things  have  become  more

convenient where you do not have to make a detour or you do  not

have  to  stop by a booth to buy your passes, but you  can  just

enter these areas as long as you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



have  the  Cashcard and the IU. And some of us, like myself  who

buy  a  monthly  pass, the number of times I  actually  use  the

gantry points at the permitted times would be probably less than

10 a month, but I buy a monthly pass because of its convenience.

So  for  those  of us who are in this category, we will  benefit

from these changes.  In fact, we will pay less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, I think the Ministry has explained to us that

the  intention  is  not  to earn revenue.   However,  there  are

certain areas in which the Ministry can further improve upon  to

reassure  the  majority of us that that is not their  intention.

As  announced, the cost of the ERP charges will be levied  on  a

per entry basis.  Therefore, vehicles will be charged every time

they  pass through the ERP gantry.  I think we want to alleviate

the burden on the motorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we may want to relook at the boundaries carefully,

especially the CBD boundaries, so that those who work within the

CBD  and  have to travel from one point to another  in  the  CBD

should be able to return back to their office without having  to

go  in  and  out of the ERP gantry points and incur  unnecessary

cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry may want to consider a rebate system

or  a diminishing charge for a motorist who has to make multiple

passes  during a single day.  I believe that those who  have  to

make multiple passes through the CBD every day have to do so not

because they really want to do so, but because they have  to  do

so.   I  do  not see any great attraction in the CBD that  would

attract  people to make multiple trips into the CBD.   Some  who

are  in the sales line or the delivery services may have to make

multiple trips into the CBD as part of their business.  I  think

the aim is to dissuade people from using the CBD.  However, as I

said, if they have to make multiple trips, it is usually because

of business reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the Ministry should have a system where

people  who  make multiple trips, say, three to five trips  into

the CBD or pass through the gantry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



several  times, they may want to either give them  a  rebate  or

reduce the charges during the repeated entries, so as not to add

unnecessarily to the cost of business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry will reconsider these comments.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister and his team

have  struck  a  fine balance between the need to  move  towards

usage  based charges, rationalise tax structures and  ensure  an

element  of progressivity in the system.  I would just  like  to

highlight three points for the Minister and his team to consider

in implementing the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it must be administered flexibly. The changes are

wide-ranging  and  the system is complex.  Road  users  and  the

industry  need  time  to digest and adjust to  the  system  and,

therefore,  I  think  the  Ministry  needs  to  be  flexible  in

responding to any unanticipated issues or problems.  The  recent

response to bring forward some of the reduction in charges  was,

I think, a case in point where the Ministry responded flexibly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need to closely monitor the impact of

ERP  on  public transportation.  The question is how  this  cost

will  be  transferred  or  passed on  to  the  users  of  public

transport.   This  is  particularly important  now  because  the

Minister has, in conjunction with this ERP initiative, announced

the deregulation of taxi fares.  In Singapore, we have less than

a  handful of taxi operators and in such an oligopolistic market

structure,  the  scope  for cartel-like  behaviour  does  exist.

Sir,  I  fully  support  the principle of deregulation  and  its

attendant benefits.  But I do believe there remains the need for

Government  to retain a residual anti-trust type of function  to

ensure  and  protect against non-competitive practices  such  as

price fixing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, the move towards ERP and other usage based

charges  must be matched by a commensurate improvement  in  road

services.   It  is  gratifying to see the underpasses,  tunnels,

flyovers, which improve traffic flow.  The most recent  addition

to this series has been the EMAS (Expressway Monitoring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



and  Advisory  System).  Some motorists  are  still  puzzled  or

uncertain  as to the value that this system adds to the  traffic

management.   In  part, Sir, this is due to some confusion  over

the  name.  Some think it is a MINDEF initiative, that it stands

for  Emergency Mobilisation Announcement System.  And others who

are  more  mischievous point out that EMAS  is the  word  "same"

spelt backwards, meaning traffic condition remains unaltered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need obviously to explain clearly to

motorists  what is the value that this system brings, especially

since  a  lot  of  it  already is provided through  radios.   In

addition,  I would appreciate it if the Minister could elaborate

what further use is envisaged for this EMAS system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just

now,  the  Member for Hougang told the Member for  Potong  Pasir

that the COE is a source of revenue for the Government.  We  all

agree  that  taxes are meant to be sources of  revenue  for  the

Government.  But this is not a one-way traffic, but  a   two-way

traffic.   When the Government  collects taxes from the  people,

they  spend  them  on improving the standard of  living  of  the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this year's budget of the Ministry of

Communications, there is a breakthrough.  There is   finally   a

reduction on diesel tax.  Under the new vehicle tax system,  the

taxi  diesel  tax  will  be reduced from  $6,600  to  $5,100,  a

reduction of $1,500.  In a dialogue between Minister Mah and the

taxi drivers, he said that this is an angpow to them.  According

to  LTA's  calculation, with the reduction in taxi  diesel  tax,

after offsetting the slightly increased road tax, there will  be

a  tax  saving of $109 million for the taxi operators  over  the

next seven years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to show appreciation to the taxi drivers'

contribution to public transportation, LTA will discuss with the

taxi  drivers'  association and the taxi  companies  on  how  to

allow the taxi drivers to enjoy a share in this rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last debate on the Ministry of Communications'

budget, my Parliamentary colleague, Mr Ong Ah Heng, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



I  suggested  that if there were any rebate on the  taxi  diesel

tax, it should be channelled to the Medisave account of the taxi

drivers.   I  hope that this would be done.  This has  been  the

common wish of the taxi drivers all these years, because in this

way,  they will not have to pay from their own pocket to top  up

the  Medisave account for the self-employed persons. I  am  very

glad  to  note  that  the  three taxi  operator  companies  have

indicated that they will be discussing with the taxi drivers  on

how to share the savings on taxi diesel tax with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my question to the Minister for Communications is:

What  is  the long term policy on diesel tax?  From the  present

$5,100,  will the diesel tax be further reduced every  year  and

eventually be completely abolished?  Or will the taxi diesel tax

be reduced to a certain amount and remain stagnant there?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although LTA has indicated that they will monitor the taxi

mileage  and  said, "If taxi mileage comes down  further,  there

will  be  scope to further reduce the diesel tax.", I feel  that

the  Government's  transparency in this matter  can  be  further

enhanced.   Why  can  a decision not be made now  to  completely

abolish  the diesel tax by a certain time?  Then, when they  are

discussing  on  how to share the savings with the taxi  drivers,

they would have a better idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new vehicle tax system seeks to shift from taxing on

ownership  to taxing on the usage.  In other words,  "use  more,

tax  more".   So  during the peak hours,  the  charges  will  be

higher.   Diesel  tax is a product of the old transport  system.

It does not fit into the new principle of taxing on usage.  This

is  also the complaint of the taxi drivers all these years.  Why

do  we  not  solve  this  old problem  simultaneously  with  the

implementation of a new tax system?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Sir, the Minister has

announced a package of vehicle tax changes.  The rationalisation

exercise has been a comprehensive one.  I welcome the changes as

they are fair and rational.  Except for the motorcyclists and  a

minority few who are adversely affected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



by  the  changes, most motorists could benefit from the new  tax

structure as the emphasis is shifted from ownership restraint to

usage restraint.  The package of rebates has also been carefully

formulated  so  as  to  lighten  the  burden  of  the  motorists

subsequent to the introduction of ERP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go on, I must declare my interest as a

director of Comfort Group Limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in formulating the tax changes, the Ministry had held

consultations with various groups, including the taxi  operators

and  taxi  drivers.   During  the  dialogue  session,  the  taxi

operators  and  drivers  have put forward  several  suggestions,

which  would  accord taxis with some concessions, in recognition

of their public transport role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two specific requests which I would like to

highlight:  first, is to reduce the taxi diesel tax,  the  point

already  raised by Mr Seng Han Thong.  The other is to phase  in

ERP charges for taxis gradually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad the Ministry has taken these requests into

consideration and has agreed to reduce taxi diesel tax  as  well

as  to  phase  in the ERP charges over a period of three  years.

The  reduction of this taxi diesel tax came as a relief  to  the

taxi  drivers  and  operators who  have  long  lobbied  for  it.

However,  the  Ministry has also decided, at the same  time,  to

raise  the ARF imposed on taxis to bring it on par with  private

vehicles.  This will raise the upfront cost of purchasing a taxi

substantially.   For new and replacement taxis,  therefore,  the

savings  in  diesel tax will be largely offset by the  increased

vehicle  taxes.   The actual cost savings to the taxi  operators

would,  therefore, come only from the existing  fleet  of  taxis

which  were subject to the old tax regime.  Nevertheless,  there

are  sizable  savings  which could be  passed  on  to  the  taxi

drivers.   And  I  have no doubt that the taxi  companies  would

discuss with the taxi driver representatives on ways to pass the

benefits  of cost savings to the drivers in a fair and equitable

manner.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in speaking on this amendment, I do not intend to pose

specific  questions to the Minister.  I just wish to offer  some

comments on this subject and commend the Minister for consulting

and  seeking the views of the various interest groups, including

the  taxi operators and drivers, while formulating the  new  tax

structure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, first, I would like

to  declare  my  interest in the subject  as  President  of  the

Automobile Association of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the responses to the forthcoming vehicle tax changes

has  been  a  tremendous disappointment in the 10% reduction  in

ARF.  There has been an expectancy of a much larger reduction in

the ARF and some people even look forward to the day when ARF is

reduced to zero.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that any reduction in ARF would be more than

offset by an increase in COE price.  When the ARF was reduced to

150%,  the  increase in COE more than made up for the reduction.

But  then again that was when COEs were transferable and  people

were  not familiar with the mechanism.  No one expected  COE  to

ever  fall  in price.  When the COEs were made non-transferable,

except for the Open Category, COE prices went for a tumble.



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, COEs in recent months have been on a downtrend. There

was  even  a  freak  result of $50 for one  of  the  categories.

People  are getting wise to the fact that a vehicle  is  not  an

investment  and  that  the  COE is  a  cost  factor  not  to  be

speculated in.  It can rise or fall.  There is no doubt that the

immediate impact of a reduction in ARF would lead to an increase

in  COE  prices.  Some dealers will package the deal  where  any

saving in ARF would be thrown into the bidding price for a  COE.

Although  the  overall  package price for  a  vehicle  would  be

lowered the savings would not reflect the reduction in ARF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the ARF would be reducing a fixed cost and

transferring it, to some extent, to the variable cost.  The  COE

is  a  variable  cost and one which the consumer can  influence.

This would no doubt pose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



some  problem  for the finance company.  With a larger  variable

cost,  they  will have to compute carefully the  limit  for  the

financing  of  a vehicle because the value would fall  when  COE

prices fall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in principle, ARF should be removed. It was

introduced to increase the cost of owning a vehicle.  It  is  an

ownership  control  mechanism to discourage  vehicle  ownership.

When  it  failed  to  achieve  the  desired  effect,  COEs  were

introduced to cap the vehicle population and ARF was reduced  to

150%.   Now  with  the introduction of ERP, the  ARF  should  be

quickly reduced to 100% and eventually be removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that it is undesirable to suddenly remove ARF.

The  market must be given time to adjust to the change otherwise

COE  prices may swing wildly upwards.  An acceptable annual rate

for  reducing  ARF  to zero would be 25% per annum.   This  way,

equilibrium  in  COE prices can be maintained  and  fluctuations

would  merely  reflect the economic outlook and  the  consumers'

purchasing power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, a common complaint of the ordinary

motorcycle owners is that the COEs for motorcycles are much  too

high.  A buyer of an ordinary motorcycle, 200 cc and lower,  has

to  bid  high  to secure a COE because of competition  from  the

buyers of the large capacity bikes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of 1997, 76.7% of bikes have engine capacities

of 200 cc and lower.  It was 81.5% at the end of 1991.  Although

the  percentage  fell by 4.8%, the numbers grew from  98,783  to

100,949, an increase of 2.2%.  In contrast, at the end of  1997,

23.3%  of bikes have engine capacities of above 200 cc.  It  was

18.5%  at  the  end  of 1991.  The number of bikes  with  engine

capacities above 200 cc grew from 22,381 to 30,642, an  increase

of  36.9%.   The biggest increase was for the very large  bikes,

those  with engine capacities above 500 cc  from 3,220 units  in

1991 to 6,526 units in 1997, an increase of 102.7%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The on-the-road price of a bike with engine capacities of

below  200 cc ranges from $5,000 to $8,000.  In fact, the  price

of  a  bike  with engine capacity of below 100 cc is  less  than

$5,000.   On  the other hand, the on-the-road prices of  popular

large  bikes can go as high as $34,000.  Thus, the  buyer  of  a

bike  costing less than $5,000 has to compete with a buyer of  a

bike costing $34,000 for the COE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of social equity, Sir, there is a need to

create  at  least  two  categories of  COE  for  the  buyers  of

motorcycles.  I would suggest one category for bikes with engine

capacities of 200 cc and lower, and another category  for  those

bikes with engine capacities above 200 cc.  It is even desirable

to consider a separate category for bikes with engine capacities

of  100  cc  and  lower.   Just as it is desirable  to  maintain

different  categories of COEs for motorcars, it is desirable  to

create  different categories of COEs for motorcycles.  The  same

principle of social equity surely must apply here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I want to urge the Minister to

consider  extending the statutory lifespan of a  car  beyond  10

years  by revising the PARF scheme and also the validity  period

of COEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, there is a graduated PARF benefit scheme

calculated  on the basis of percentage of the open market  value

of  cars  from 80% to 130% for cars registered on or  after  1st

November  1990.   Sir,  the PARF is an incentive  given  to  car

owners to change their cars before the 10-year period.  However,

given  the improvements in car technology since the PARF  scheme

was  introduced more than 22 years ago and the compulsory annual

inspection  of  older cars, the PARF scheme can be  modified  to

extend  the 10-year lifespan of a car.  New car models are  also

more  fuel efficient, the engine more robust and they break down

less  frequently  than their counterparts 20  years  ago.   With

regular  maintenance  and  inspection,  most  of  the  cars   on

Singapore roads can be roadworthy beyond the 10-year limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to propose that the Government consider

extending the PARF incentive for cars from the current 10



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



years  to, say, 12 years.  The PARF for a car which is 11  years

old can be 10% lower than those of a 10-year old car, ie, 70% of

the open market value, and a 12-year old car, 20% less, that is,

60% of the OMV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very wasteful for a well-maintained 10-year old

car  to be scrapped just because it has become uneconomical  for

the  owner  to pay for a new COE and at the same time  lose  the

residual PARF value of the car.  Moreover, with the introduction

of  ERP, motorists are likely to minimise the use of their  cars

which is what the ERP is meant to achieve.  Relatively speaking,

these  cars are likely to be roadworthy for a longer  period  of

time.  It would therefore be appropriate to extend the statutory

lifespan  of a car in Singapore to 12 years.  With the extension

of  the  PARF benefits to 12 years, I think COEs should also  be

valid for 12 years with the option to extend for another five or

10 years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Certificate of Entitlement (COE)

is  a key component of our road management system and acts as  a

control mechanism on the car population.  Hence, with the recent

announcement  on  the  changes in road  tax  structure  and  the

implementation of the ERP, I think an announcement  on  the  COE

should  have  been  made at the same time.  No announcement  was

made on what the COE policy would be like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this has not been done, I wish the Minister to

also consider making some basic changes to the COE.  We have now

rationalised that a motorcycle is equivalent to half  a  car  on

the  road.   This  being the case Sir, then  all  cars  must  be

treated as the same, whether it is a large car or small capacity

car.   The  amount of road space taken up or used is  the  same.

Moreover,  it  can also be argued that we do not have  different

sizes of car park lots.  All car park lots are drawn in the same

manner   and  they  are  of  the  same  size.   In   fact,   the

motorcyclists  may even argue that although their motorcycle  is

equivalent  to  half a car, actually in terms of parking  space,

one  car  park lot may be equivalent to three or four motorcycle

parking lots.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since cars are all the same, perhaps we should relook

at  how the COE categories may be removed.  There may have  been

sociological   or   political  reasons  for   having   different

categories  of  cars in the quota system.  But as  a  result  of

supply and demand, there have been occasions when in fact a  COE

for  a  small  car is higher than that of a large capacity  car.

This  rationalisation of putting all the COEs as one class, when

put  in place, may mean lower COE cost.  One cannot assume  that

even  those  who can afford a large car may not wish  to  own  a

small car from the viewpoint of economy.  Presently, an affluent

person who wishes to own a small car has no choice but to  place

a  bid in the small car category.  If it is a wrong timing,  the

aberration  happens and there may be a bigger demand  for  small

cars and the COE becomes more expensive than the large cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an intermediate measure, I like the Minister to

consider  removing the categories in the COEs and make  it  only

one   class.   But  for  sociological  and  other  reasons  like

discouraging  large car ownership, maybe we can have  a  premium

set  for  different type of cars.  At the end of the day,  since

all  cars  are equal, I think we should only have one  class  of

cars in the COE.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, listening to Mr Chng

Hee Kok, I am surprised that we think alike.  Because I too want

to  point  out  the problems with the current systems.   We  all

remember  the  $50 COE and my colleague, Mr Gerard  Ee,  already

said  it  was a freak result and, to me, it was also a fluke  of

the  system.  Based on the prevailing COE quota premium, in that

particular exercise, the loss of COE revenue was probably of the

order of $15 million.  So in a way, Sir, it is like distributing

this  amount of money to the 300-odd people who were  successful

in  that particular bid.  So it is like tikam tikam.  It  was  a

lucky  draw for them.  It does not truly serve the system  well.

All  these years, the Government has been very careful  when  it

comes to spending public money.  Similarly, it is also true that

we  should be very careful in collecting public revenue.  So  if

we were to have a system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



that allows freak results like this to happen, I think it is not

a good system.  It should be reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, similar to Mr Chng, after seeing the quota system

being   in  operation  for  several  years,  there  are  several

peculiarities of the COE system that I am not satisfied with.  I

refer  here  to  the successful bids of the various  categories.

One  would  expect to see that the bigger the  car,  the  higher

would  be  the  COE.   What  happens  is  that  the  incremental

increase,  as you go up to the higher category is  smaller.   At

certain  times, a COE for a large car is in fact more  expensive

than a COE for a luxury car.  I would also project that when the

ARF  is  reduced  from  150%  to 140%,  the  reduction  will  be

transferred to COE.  But the amount transferred will be  smaller

in  the large car category and larger in the small car category.

In  that sense, it would definitely benefit the large car  users

more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road tax system announced recently by the Minister

embodied within it a progressivity formula.  And I would like to

see  the  same progressivity in the COE prices.  One  can  argue

that  we  cannot really control that in the current COE  system.

But  my  response  would be that perhaps the  number  of  quotas

allocated  to each category is not appropriate with  respect  to

this desire to achieve progressivitiy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the current COE system has also an

element  of built-in bias of favouring big cars and luxury  cars

and,  that  is, we actually created a category called  the  Open

COEs.   And most Open COE quotas have been used to register  big

and  luxury cars.  Very few, I believe, have been used for other

categories.  Probably, none for small cars.  So therefore, there

is  a built-in bias in the COE system with this Open category by

allowing  buyers  of luxury cars and big cars to  use  the  Open

category to register their vehicles.  Therefore, in essence, the

luxury car and big car categories have a larger number of quotas

than  what we have allocated.  In my view, it is also the reason

why  the COE prices level off at the high end of the car market.

To overcome the shortcoming I mentioned, one proposal is what Mr

Chng



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



has  said,  to merge all the COE categories into one.   In  this

way,  the  number of quotas allocated to the COE  pool  will  be

larger  and it will be very unlikely that a similar freak result

like  the  $50 COE would happen.  I think it is time for  us  to

review  the  COE system.  I would like the Minister to  consider

this suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, may I take my two amendments

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the LTA has recently opened some new

flyovers   and   three-tier   road   systems   such    as    the

Queensway/Farrer  Road junction and the Bukit Timah  Road/Farrer

Road  junction.  There are more to come, I believe, such as  the

one at the Braddell Road/Upper Serangoon Road junction.  I would

like  to  ask  the  Minister  to enlighten  this  House  on  the

principles, such as cost benefit analysis, which are  considered

when  the LTA decides on where such three-tier junctions are  to

be built, whether there will be more of these, whether they have

been  found to be effective so far, and the respective  cost  of

building a flyover as against an underground vehicular  pass  or

tunnel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, I would like to speak on the deregulation of the

taxi  industry.   The Minister has announced to this House  that

the LTA will be recommending to the Public Transport Council  to

deregulate  taxi fares in Singapore.  There are only three  taxi

operators  in  Singapore currently.  Members of the  public  are

worried  that the three operators will get together  to  form  a

cartel  to  fix  prices.   If  the  prices  are  fixed   at   an

unreasonably high level, commuters will suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say cartel, Sir, I am also referring to the

situation where the parties may not officially be a cartel,  but

would  informally  match  each  other's  rates  in  an  unspoken

arrangement,  such  as  what  we suspect  is  happening  in  the

petroleum  industry.  Would the LTA or PTC  be  monitoring  this

situation?   To  prevent this, it might  be  important  to  also

liberalise  taxi services so that more companies can  enter  the

market to provide competition if they so desire.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



Further, if taxi services are to be deregulated and irrespective

of  whether more entrants are allowed, there must be  a  minimum

service  standard  of quality, so that free  market  competition

will not descend to unacceptable levels and tarnish the image of

the  world-class transportation system that we are building.   I

would  urge the PTC to set such quality of service standards  in

future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Sir, once again, I wish to declare my

interest as a director of the Comfort group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has announced that the LTA will be

recommending to the Public Transport Council to deregulate  taxi

fares  when  the new vehicular tax structure and the  electronic

road pricing system are implemented on 1st September 1998.  This

will  allow taxi operators to set their own fares so  that  they

will better meet the requirements of the various market segments

and deploy their resources to best meet the demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the deregulation, the onus of setting taxi fares

rests  with the taxi operators and not the regulator, as is  the

case now.  In setting the fares, the operator would have to take

into  consideration the market conditions, the supply and demand

for  taxis,  the  cost  of providing the service  and  what  the

commuters  are  prepared  to pay.  Competition  among  the  taxi

operators  would also place a lead on fare increases,  as  those

who  charge higher fares risk losing their customers.  The  fear

among  the commuters is: with the deregulation, would  the  taxi

operators  raise  fares  arbitrarily?  Would  operators  form  a

cartel  to fix fares, and this is a point which has been  raised

by Mr Iswaran and Dr Toh See Kiat?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my view is that our taxi commuters are sensitive to

fare  increases.  While one cannot rule out the possibility  and

justification for fare revision in the future, it is  a  fallacy

to  believe  that  the taxi operators can just raise  the  fares

arbitrarily without due regard to the commuters' ability to pay.

The demand for taxis is price elastic.  The commuters can easily

switch to other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



forms  of public transport, like buses and MRT, if they consider

the  taxi fares to be unreasonably high.  And we already  had  a

previous  experience  in the mid-80s.  In 1985,  when  the  taxi

fares were raised substantially, the demand dropped drastically,

as   a   result  of  which  the  taxi  drivers  suffered  badly.

Consequently,  the fares had to be lowered to a  more  realistic

level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In setting taxi fares, therefore, the operators cannot

ignore  the  market conditions.  Most of our taxi drivers  could

still  remember  the unpleasant experience  which  I  have  just

mentioned.   They  themselves,  not  just  the  commuters,   are

apprehensive of the consequences of fare increases.  They  would

rather  not  raise fares for fear of losing their  customers  if

their  operating  cost could be contained and remain  unchanged.

The  taxi company too would rather not raise the rental rate for

fear  of  losing their drivers if the costs of doing business  - the COE, ALS, financing cost and others  - do not go up.  But in

real  life,  things  do  not remain constant.   There  are  many

variables.    There  are  many economic  factors  at  play  and,

finally,  it  is  the  market forces which would  determine  the

supply and demand and price of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With deregulation, the taxi fares would reflect more

accurately the state of supply and demand.  For instance,  there

is  a strong demand for taxis during peak hours.  But during off

peak  hours, empty cruising of taxis is a common sight.  We  can

try  to  address  this  problem through differential  pricing  - differential pricing according to the hour of the day  and  even

by day of the week.  In some of the cities in the United States,

even the bus fares are discounted on Sundays in order to attract

ridership.   There  is  no  reason why  the  same  principle  of

differential pricing cannot be applied here either for buses  or

taxis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deregulation would also enable the taxi operators to

introduce more differentiated and innovative service to suit the

special  needs of the customers.  We already have  Mercedes  and

London cabs on our roads to cater for those who are prepared  to

pay  more to travel in style and comfort.  One day we might have

Kancil and Daihatsu



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



taxis  to cater to the budget-conscious commuters, provided  the

vehicles  meet  LTA's  conditions.   The  end  result   of   the

deregulation  exercise is that we would have a  more  efficient,

competitive and responsive taxi service which would better serve

the interest and needs of the commuting public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the deregulation exercise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the taxi service

has  improved considerably, when we compare to the taxi  service

of  the  60s  and when pirate taxis were a feature in Singapore.

We  have  come a long way.  But, unfortunately, during the  peak

periods, it is difficult to get a taxi, unless we book  one.   I

think  the Government has to think of ways and means to minimise

this problem, because it costs $3.20 to book a taxi and not many

people  in Singapore  I am not speaking of all of us  can afford

this and so they have to queue for a taxi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also improve the training for taxi drivers.

They  are the first people the tourists meet.  They should  know

some  basic  facts  about  Singapore.  They  should  be  smartly

dressed  and  perhaps they should be persuaded  not  to  grumble

about Singapore's ills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the SZ cars. I am glad that the tax for

SZ  cars  is  being  revised.  I would urge  the  Government  to

consider  other  means by which it would be economical  for  the

people  to use SZ cars.   As a matter of fact, the other  day  I

met  a professional who is actually driving an SZ car on a long-term  basis.   In  order to support the SZ  car  companies,  the

Government  must look at the contribution that this group  would

make  in minimising congestion on our roads.  While doing so,  I

do  not want to give the impression that the market force has to

be  abandoned  .   But sometimes, the market  force  has  to  be

manipulated  in  order to serve the community better,  and  this

would  be  one  way.  I hope the Government  would  not  be  too

orthodox in its approach and see wherever they could help the SZ

car industry to grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that I would like to applaud the Government

is the move to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



support the car cooperative.   This is something which we should

encourage    and,    wherever   possible,   with    Government's

encouragement and help,  this scheme will help us in  minimising

car ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take my other cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, we cannot run away from the fact

that   we   are  a  small  city  state.   The  land   for   road

transportation  is  limited.  The matter is further  complicated

because  we have a built-up city.  The public has to acknowledge

that  the  Government has spent huge sums of money in  improving

our roads and the land transportation system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know I am going to be a voice in the wilderness,

because everybody who has spoken before me, has been asking  for

car ownership to grow, but I am going to speak against it.  Sir,

I am going to be a minority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most young Singaporeans aspire to own a car. There is

nothing wrong in their dreams, but we have to be realistic.   If

every  graduate decides to own a car within the first two  years

of  his  working  career, our roads will be  clogged.   It  will

affect our economic life.  We will be like the other cities  and

I do not think we want to do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes I think the Government is trying to please

the car owners more than the public transport commuters who are,

in  fact,  the  majority of the taxpayers.   May  I  urge  young

Singaporeans to save their money initially and put  their  money

in  other forms of investment, and postpone the buying of a  car

to  a  later stage.  On the other hand, those families with two,

three  or even four cars should think of minimising, or at least

give up one car.  I know it is a difficult proposition.  Some of

us  may be affected.  But in the interest of the motorcar-owning

class, I think we may have to consider the proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I relate an anecdote, Sir. I know of a friend who,

instead of buying a car, bought a terrace house and he was  very

fortunate.   He upgraded and he now owns a bungalow  in  a  good

location and it  is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



now  worth a few million dollars.  Now, he has a car.  Since  he

has  a  very  big  family, he has SZ cars as  well.   I  am  not

suggesting  that  all  those who save could become  millionaires

overnight.  But I am saying that they should get their  priority

right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other thing I am going to suggest is rather

radical.   I have suggested it to a Select Committee  and  I  am

going  to suggest it again.  I think that each car owner  should

be  made  to  pay  a levy of $50.  Of course,  they  should  get

something  in return.   They could be given a free ride  on  the

MRT  and buses.  This is only for the car owners but not members

of  their  family.  In this way, I think they will  be persuaded

to  use  the buses and taxis more often, because they know  they

are  going  to pay $50.  And if they do not use it,  of  course,

they  lose the benefit of a free MRT ride.  It is a very radical

suggestion but I want the Minister to give some consideration to

my suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got another cut. I wonder whether you would

allow me to take it now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will give other Members a chance. Mr

Jeyaretnam.



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, my

subject  is,  of  course, the problem which  the  Government  is

attempting to tackle through electronic road pricing  and  other

measures.   The problem of keeping our roads from being  clogged

up  which results in a loss of hours which may be put to  better

use.   No one disputes that we should do whatever we can to keep

our  roads unclogged.  The question is: how do we do this?   The

simplest  thing  is to ban every car off the  road  for  certain

periods of time.  The second thing is perhaps, which is what the

Government seems to be favouring, to raise the price for the use

of the road.  This is a monetarist policy.  But this policy does

not take into account, as I have tried to say earlier last week,

those who have to use the car not just to get to work and home



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



but  who  have  to use the car or the motorcycle to  earn  their

livelihood.   And if you are going to tax them every  time  they

use the road, then it would mean a lessening of their income,  a

greater increase in their expense, and so they suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, those who do not really need to use the

car  or  to  use that part of the road with their cars,  because

they have the necessary means, ie, the money to pay for it, have

free  access to that road or stretch.  This is why my Party says

the  arrangements are discriminatory.  Like most  PAP  policies,

they tend to favour the rich and the privileged and they do  not

take  into account the needs of those who need to use  the  road

and  who are perhaps not that well-off to afford the charges and

fees that are being imposed for the use of the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time that the Ministry considered other

solutions, non-monetary solutions, to this problem.   Have  they

at  all considered taking a census of people who need to use the

road for their livelihood, as I keep saying, the tradesman,  the

doctor,  or  others who need to use the cars or the motorcycles,

and  those who just use the car to drive to work in the town and

then leave it there, and then drive back?  Is it not possible to

categorise  the  users into "essential users" and "non-essential

users"?   And then restrict the use of that road to  those  non-essential  users  for  some period of the  day,  and  allow  the

essential users the unrestricted use of that road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was in Johor during the Japanese military

occupation.   And  when they had this problem, not  because  the

roads  were  clogged  but because they  were  running  short  of

petrol,  they  did  not resort to a monetarist  policy  of  just

charging  people  more  and more for  use  of  the  road.   They

categorised  users into "essential" and "non-essential".   Those

who  needed  to use their cars and motorcycles were given  black

labels  and they could use the car at all times.  Those who  did

not  really need the car for the livelihood but only  wanted  to

get to the market or to send their children to school or get  to

work,  they  were given red labels, which meant that they  could

use the car for two hours in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



morning and two hours in the evening.  For the rest of the  day,

they  were  kept off the roads.  And in that way, they  achieved

what they wanted - lesser use of the petrol.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would ask the Ministry whether they would consider non-monetary solutions to this problem and not just pick one which

is  the  easiest, and that is, to raise the prices so  that  you

discriminate  against those who are unable  to  pay  and  favour

those who are able to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I finish, may I also point out what would appear

to be some incongruities.  The Minister was saying the other day

that  now  with the introduction of the ERP, the Government  can

issue  more COEs.  In other words, he says the Government  would

be  quite happy to see more cars on the roads used by people who

are able to pay for this and can also pay for the COE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I do not understand why it is necessary to

subject the taxi drivers and the taxi owners to paying the heavy

diesel tax and the other ERP charges and what-not, for using the

roads.   They  are  public  service  vehicles  and  surely   the

objective must be to encourage people to use the public  service

vehicles rather than their own cars.  They can only do  that  if

you  bring  down the cost of the public service transport.   And

you  do  not do that, if you pile on the taxi drivers all  these

charges,  heavy diesel tax charge, and then the  ERP  and  other

charges.   So  would the Ministry please give  some  thought  to

other solutions to this problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the break now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head I (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, in

the  Committee of Supply in July last year, I announced that  my

Ministry  would undertake a comprehensive review of the  vehicle

tax structure in conjunction with the implementation of ERP.  We

had  two  objectives  in mind.  One, was  to  achieve  a  better

ownership  between ownership and usage in managing our  traffic,

in  better controlling traffic congestion; and, two, was to have

a fairer, a more rational and a more consistent basis for taxing

vehicles on the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new vehicle tax structure announced last week on 4th

March should not be seen in isolation.  It has to be taken as  a

total  package,  in  other words, taken together  with  the  ERP

implementation plan as well as the package of road tax  rebates.

Just to give a very quick summary and the bottom line of the new

tax  package,  a  majority or 70% of vehicle owners,  especially

companies and businesses, will benefit from savings in road tax.

The  remaining 30% will see an increase in their road tax mainly

because they have been paying a disproportionately low road  tax

relative to other vehicles when you consider the amount of  road

space they use or the amount of wear and tear they cause on  our

roads.   However, to help them adjust, the Government has phased

in the road tax increase over three years.  We should take it as

a  total package, ie, the new tax structure, the phasing in  and

also  the road tax rebates which all vehicle owners will  enjoy.

Many of these vehicle owners, especially motorcyclists, will end

up paying lower or no road tax in the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reactions to the new tax structure have been generally

positive and I would like to take this opportunity to express my

appreciation  to  all those who have given  their  comments  and

feedback in the consultation exercise that my Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



conducted  last  year.  I would also like to thank  Members  for

their  support  of  the new vehicle tax structure  and  the  ERP

implementation plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a few dissenting voices on the ERP which I

would  like to deal with before I address the specific  concerns

that were raised by Members.  Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, in particular,

questioned the principle of charging for road usage.   He  asked

whether it is fair to charge for the use of the roads.  For many

years,  most  countries, if not all countries, operated  on  the

principle that all motorists just need to pay a lump sum for the

use  of  the  roads and thereafter, the use of  roads  would  be

virtually free.  So irrespective of how many times they drove or

how  much  congestion or how much pollution  they  cause,  there

would be no incremental cost involved in using the roads.   This

was  well  and good, until more and more people wanted  to  also

enjoy this free usage, and as more and more people wanted to use

these  same  roads at the same time, the roads became  more  and

more congested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classic solution for many countries then was to build

more  roads,  ie,  not enough roads, roads are being  congested,

just  build  some more.  If there is not enough land,  you  just

build  over,  double-decker and triple-decker roads.   But  many

cities  are finding out today that their citizens are no  longer

prepared  to have the road builders come along and rip up  their

country  side or to see their cityscape destroyed by  all  these

ugly  concrete flyovers all over the place, and having all these

cars polluting the country side or the city that they are living

in.  Why suffer all this in order to allow motorists to come and

drive on the roads and pollute the environment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reality today is that people are now coming around

to  the  idea that road space is a scarce resource, as scarce  a

resource  like water, oil, or any other commodity  which  is  in

short supply.  So when Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam said that he does  not

oppose the idea of unclogging our roads, that it is a good idea,

I was very happy to hear that because I think it is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



first  time  that  he  has  accepted that  roads  are  a  scarce

resource.  So now we are getting somewhere in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he does not favour the idea of charging. He says that

if  we charge for this road usage, this scarce resource, we  are

being  unfair.   He prefers to ration.  He prefers  to  allocate

this  scarce  resource by fiat.  He decides, or  the  Government

decides,  or the civil servant decides who gets to use the  road

and  who does not - black labels, red labels, no label, I guess,

that  would be the third category.  So who gets the black label?

Who  gets the red label?  It reminds me of some brand of whisky.

But  who  are  we to decide who is more deserving of  using  the

road?  The  housewife  who is driving a  child  to  school,  the

businessman who needs a car to attend an important meeting,  the

salesman   who  has  to  take  the  car  around  to  drive   for

appointments?   Mr  Jeyaretnam  says  salesmen,   black   label;

doctors, black label; housewife with kids, red label; those  who

go to work, no label, because you have no right to be driving to

work.  I must say I sympathise with that point of view.  But who

are we to decide or to tell people that you cannot drive to work

and  that if you use your car just to drive to work, you get  no

label?   Is it not better for us to give the choice back to  the

motorist to let him decide what he wants to do through a  system

of  charging a  fair price for the use of the roads?  Is it  not

better for us to reduce the upfront cost of owning a vehicle, as

we  have done with the road tax rationalisation, to give back to

the  motorist a certain sum of money, not an inconsiderable  sum

of  money,  and  then  to let the motorist  decide  for  himself

whether he wants to give this money back to the LTA?

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many cities are coming around to this harsh reality that,

first  of  all,  road space is a scarce resource and,  secondly,

that  the  best  way of allocating this scarce  resource  is  to

charge  a  certain  price for using it, like  any  other  scarce

resource, whether it is water, land, oil, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we faced up to this harsh reality many years

ago when we introduced road pricing in 1975, when we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



introduced the Area Licensing Scheme.  At that time, the CBD was

becoming  congested.  There were only so many  roads  you  could

build  in  the  CBD and yet there were more jobs  in  the  city.

There  were  more people wanting to drive into the  CBD.   There

were more offices, more meetings being held, more people wanting

to drive their vehicles in.  What do we do?  We charge $3 if you

want  to  drive in.  If you have no business to be in there,  do

not  pay  the  $3.  That is one car less.  And the motorist  who

pays  the $3 suddenly realises, "Hey, I've got a little bit more

space to move.  My car moves a little bit faster.  I get to that

meeting  a little bit earlier.  I save time."  And surely  to  a

businessman, time means money.  So at the end of the day, the $3

that  he spends is more than recovered by the amount of time  he

has saved, by the amount of hassle he has forgone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only so much land. There are so many competing

uses for our land.  We have to make optimal use of our land  for

housing,  for  catchment areas, for factories, for  playgrounds,

for  schools, etc.  And among these competing uses, we  have  to

build roads.  Today, we already have 12% of our land devoted  to

roads.   How much more land should we give up in order to  build

roads?  We cannot be building more roads.  So we manage the  use

of  existing road space.  We encourage people not to  use  their

cars  if they do not really need to.  But how do we define need?

Who  are  we  to  say that your need is greater  than  the  next

person's  need?   We  do not wish to define that.   We  let  the

motorist decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we make better use of the land set aside for roads?

We  give  priority to buses.  Why?  Because buses make the  most

effective  use of road space.  And Mr Rai is absolutely  correct

and  I  am  glad  that, although he is in the minority,  he  has

spoken up for the bus commuters, because this is also the reason

why we are introducing ERP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduce ERP to encourage people to use our roads

wisely.  We say that pricing is the most efficient mechanism  to

allocate  this  scarce resource.  At the  end  of  the  day,  we

collect revenue from people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



using  this scarce resource.  Mr Low Thia Khiang says that  this

is  a  revenue  collecting mechanism.   Yes,  it  is  a  revenue

collecting mechanism, and I am not ashamed to say that it  is  a

revenue  collecting  mechanism.  But what do  we  do  with  this

money?  When we collect the revenues from people who voluntarily

decide  to  use  the  roads, we take the  money,  which  is  the

property of all Singaporeans, and we put it to good use, whether

it is for public transport infrastructure, education or housing.

It  goes  into consolidated revenue which is then used  for  the

public good.  And what is wrong with that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam then suggests that ERP is unfair because it

only  affects  the  poor, while the rich will  not  be  affected

because they can afford to pay.  Has he not forgotten something?

Most  Singaporeans do not drive to work.  They take the bus  and

the MRT.  They will not be affected by the ERP.  And, indeed, if

we  can  make the roads clearer for the buses, then surely  that

must  be welcomed by bus commuters if they can actually  get  to

work  on  time and get to work faster.  So, rather  than  saying

that the ERP is actually discriminating against the poor, he has

forgotten that actually there is a very large group of people in

Singapore  who  will  be  benefiting,  directly  through  faster

travel,  and  indirectly through the  revenues that  we  collect

from ERP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam See Tong made the comment

that  ERP  is a revenue collecting mechanism.  I have  addressed

that point earlier. Mr  Chiam further asked whether COEs will be

scrapped  as a result of the ERP.  Mr Low has already given  him

the reply, right answer but wrong working.  I think he gets half

mark  for that.  The right answer is that we cannot scrap  COEs.

We have to keep COEs, at the same time that we have to introduce

ERP, because the two must go hand in hand.  If we just carry  on

with COEs, we end up in a situation where it is very inflexible.

We  cannot  continue to keep adding COEs.  We  are  now  talking

about a 3% increase every year.  Our land does not expand by  3%

every  year ad infinitum.  At which point in time do we have  to

start to scale back on COEs?  20



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



years'  time, 30 years' time, if we were to depend on just  this

mechanism alone? But if we also have in tandem a mechanism which

regulates the usage of roads, which encourages people to use the

roads  more judiciously and if we put the two together, then  we

have  two  very  powerful  levers to allow  us  to  manage  road

congestion  but,  at  the  same time, to  allow  for  a  regular

increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, which  is  part

and parcel of managing aspirations, managing people's desire  to

own  cars.  No, we cannot have ERP alone, we cannot scrap  COEs,

but neither can we have COEs alone without the ERP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a revenue collecting mechanism? I say, yes. But we

do it in a way that  gives the motorists the choice whether they

want  to  pay that fee for using the roads or not.  The  upfront

taxes have already been reduced, slashed in some cases.  The ERP

revenue  is an estimate.  If the system is successful, there  is

really  no reason why we should be collecting more revenue  than

what we are collecting today.  On that basis, we have decided to

make  those  tax  changes on a revenue neutral  basis  today  by

giving  rebates,  by reducing taxes.  The tax reductions  alone,

including  the estimate of increased ERP revenue over  the  next

five  years, is going to cost the Government something like $1.2

billion, over five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens after five years, Mr Low asked. The rebates

will  run  out.   By that time, people would have  had  time  to

adjust to the new ERP infrastructure.  And in five years'  time,

if  people  continue  to drive as they do today,  if  businesses

continue to operate as they do today, in spite of the fact  that

now they will be charged for the use of the roads, that now they

are going to be charged per pass, I would be very surprised.   I

expect that there will be changes and, in fact, this is what  we

hope will be achieved when we introduce the ERP, that we hope to

change  people's  driving  habits.  And  if  motorists'  driving

habits are changed in such a way that they do not have to pay so

much  for ERP, so be it.  That is the purpose of the ERP system.

If  they decide that they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



going to drive irrespective of ERP charges, then we will collect

the revenue, because the motorist willingly has decided that  he

is going to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the revenue situation be like five years from now?

I  do not know.  All I know is that we have a mechanism in place

which  puts  the  responsibility firmly  in  the  hands  of  the

motoring  public.  And that, I think, is a fairer way  of  doing

things.  It  is  more  rational  and,  I  believe,  it  is  more

effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to some of the specific concerns of

Members.  Mr Chay expressed some concern that motorcyclists  are

paying high ERP charges than taxis, and he felt that it was  not

fair.  Dr Michael Lim also suggested that we should consider low

ERP  charges for those who use the roads more frequently.   Sir,

the  principle  of shifting upfront cost to the  usage  cost  is

really  one of the fundamental principles of the ERP  policy  or

strategy  to  manage  demand for road space.   Why?   Because  a

vehicle  owner  who  has paid a lot of  money  for  his  car  or

motorbike and pays very little or nothing for its use would have

very  little incentive to cut down on usage.  So this is why  in

the  new tax structure, we have reduced upfront taxes.  We  have

cut  registration fee.  We have cut ARF and we have shifted more

of the cost to usage, mainly through the ERP charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERP is a pay per pass system. The more you use, the

more  you  pay.    It  is  fairer and it is  more  effective  in

encouraging road users to cut down on their usage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on this basis, it is not possible to accede to Dr

Michael Lim's suggestion that we levy a lower fee on those  who,

for  one  reason or another, need to use the roads  more  often.

This is not fair to those who do not use the roads more often or

who have managed to change their pattern in such a way that they

do  not  use  the  roads more often.  If we did that,  it  would

defeat  the  purpose of the ERP.  However, as Members  would  be

well aware, we have recognised that this is a  sudden change  in

the  system.  To the heavy users, it will come as a very  sudden

shock. To accommodate that, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



decided  that  we will phase in the changes over three  or  four

years for taxis and commercial vehicles.  And this is the reason

why  Mr Chay observed that motorcycles will be paying lower  ERP

charges than taxis, because we are phasing in taxi charges  over

three  years.   Of course, this only applies in  the  first  few

years.   However, when the phasing-in period is over, ERP  rates

for taxis will be exactly the same as for private cars, by which

time his concern is no longer valid.



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok made some suggestions on road pricing.

Yes,  we  decided  to introduce the concept of shoulder  pricing

because  of  this  phenomenon of "peak within  the  peak"  where

everybody tries to jam into that particular stretch of  road  at

that  particular time.  So we have decided that we will try  and

spread  out  that  peak  load by levying lower  charges  in  the

shoulder periods.  However, "shoulder" pricing is a new concept,

and  I  think we should start off with a more simple  structure.

Therefore,  we  have decided to have a peak  price,  a  shoulder

price  and  an off-peak price.  It is a little bit  discreet,  I

agree.   But  let us try the simple structure first and,  if  it

works, we will extend it to other congestion points, and we will

also  look  at  varying the pricing to suit the traffic  pattern

more accurately, as suggested by Mr Chng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng has some comments on gantries. Very quickly, I

just  wish  to  clarify that there are two  gantries.   Separate

gantries for CBD and ERP are only a temporary problem.  Come 1st

September, there will only be one gantry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location of gantries - Dr Michael Lim suggested that we

review  the  locations  of gantries so that  motorists  are  not

charged  unnecessarily.  Yes, I agree.  With the present system,

we  already have some problems like that.  So, with ERP, we will

take  the opportunity to review.  But at the end of the  day,  I

would  advise  all motorists to continue to plan their  journeys

well in advance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran had a few queries about flexibility. We will be

flexible, in terms of implementation and enforcement.  But we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



hope  that  motorists will take the time and effort  to  get  to

understand the system, to use it and to be familiar with it,  so

that  there  are  very little user-related  problems,  come  1st

April.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about EMAS, what is EMAS. Basically, it is an

early warning system, to put it very clearly.  I am not familiar

with the MINDEF jargon, but I can assure him that it is an early

warning system, just like MINDEF has early warning systems,  and

equally  useful for motorists once they get used to  it.   There

has  been  a  rather  protracted period  of  testing  which  has

confused  some people and attracted some rather snide  comments.

But I would like to suggest that we give it a try when it starts

and, if it works as well as planners feel, I think it will be  a

great  boon  to motorists.  Incidentally, this is not  something

new.   Such  systems are well accepted in Europe and Japan.   If

you travel on highways in Japan, for example, you will see these

numbers on the expressways which give you times.  Those are  the

times  which  tell  you how much congestion  there  is  on  that

stretch of highway.  So 50 minutes mean that you expect to reach

the  next junction in 50 minutes; please, if you can, avoid that

junction.  That is basically what those signs mean.  But,  as  I

said,  it  is  something new, give it a try,  and  you  will  be

pleasantly surprised at how useful it can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat expressed concern about safety and

reliability of the IU.  I understand his concern because I think

this  is  a  matter  which  concerns  every  motorist,  and  for

motorists to see a foreign object staring at him in the face  in

the  car can be rather unnerving.  But I have the assurance from

the  consortium which has tendered and is supplying the IU.   It

is  an  international  consortium (Philips,  Mitsubishi,  Mitsui

Electronics,  CEI  Systems  in Singapore)  and  they  have  been

awarded   the   contract.   We  have   drawn   up   very   rigid

specifications  for them to carry out very rigorous  tests.   In

fact, the testing in the laboratory and the testing in the field

took  something  like 18 months, longer than most  new  products

which  go to market.  We had to be more than careful.  We  could

have  done the acceptance tests in a much shorter time.  But  we

were dealing with 680,000 vehicles



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



throughout  Singapore  and we wanted this  system  to  last,  we

wanted  the reliability of the system to be as high as possible,

and we could not take chances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason why the testing took longer than usual.

It  is another reason why it cannot be miniaturised.  The answer

is  that testing started off 18 months ago and during that time,

many  things had happened.  But the suppliers assure us that  it

is  safe.   They have consulted, as far as they can, with  motor

manufacturers  on  where it should be located.   The  installers

have also been trained to install it in such a way that the unit

would not be dislodged.  All in all, I think we have to take the

results  of the tests as reliable and we will implement it  come

1st  April, with the assurances that it will be safe and it will

be reliable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will take Dr Toh's suggestion to put some of these

details in the LTA Webpage, the Internet Website, eg, the  FAQs,

as  he  called  it,  on the IU and the ERP systems.   If  he  is

interested,  the  website address is "www.lta.gov.sg".   If  you

cannot  access that one, you can also go through the AA  website

which  is "www.aas.com.sg", and this is hyperlinked to  the  LTA

website.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were other concerns raised by Mr Sinnakaruppan. He

is  suggesting that we use other forms of payment for ERP,  like

NETS,  cash,  and  credit card.   When  we  first  drew  up  the

specifications,  we had to decide whether we  wanted  to  use  a

passive  system,  in other words, a centralised  billing  system

whereby   we  will  send  you  a  bill  every  month,   and   Mr

Sinnakaruppan would go and check his bill and see where  he  has

been for the last month, and he would decide whether the bill is

correct or not.  That was one option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other option was an active system, a smart card based

system where you get deduction every time you pass through.   No

record  is  kept,  no  bills are sent to your  house.   We  have

decided  to  go  for the smart card system for several  reasons.

First  of  all,  in  this  way  we do  not  need  a  centralised

accounting and billing system,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>



which is a very costly and very massive exercise.  Secondly,  by

charging per pass, the moment you pass through a point and  hear

a  beep,  and you realise that your cash card balance  has  gone

down  by  X  dollars, you become more conscious of the  cost  of

motoring.   You become more conscious of the fact that  you  are

actually passing through an ERP control point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, by using smart cards, we can also help to move

towards a cashless society.  Smart cards are an important way of

commercial transactions.  They can become more important  if  we

can  encourage more people to use it.  I believe  that  the  ERP

will  provide one of these "killer" applications, as  they  call

it, for smart cards in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, last but not least, there is a question of

privacy that I alluded to you earlier.  Privacy is an issue  for

some  motorists.  In fact, I believe Mr Sinnakaruppan  may  have

understated the concerns of motorists about privacy.   It  is  a

concern.   If  you  recall, when Hong Kong was  looking  at  the

electronic  road  pricing system some years  back,  one  of  the

reasons  why  they  dropped it was because of  this  concern  of

privacy.   And  at that time the only system available  was  the

centralised billing system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would not rule out this concern about privacy. But

that  is  not the major reason why we chose the Cashcard system.

As  I  said,  there were many other reasons.  Nevertheless,  his

suggestion is a valid one because if we can do it, it does  help

to  make  the  system more convenient.  It  is  a  direct  debit

system.   It  is almost a Giro system.  It is like  the  transit

link  card  system where you do not have to top up your  transit

link  card.  Every time it falls below a certain balance, as  it

goes  through the MRT turnstiles, it automatically tops  up  for

you.   So it is possible to be done.  It is convenient.  And  we

will look into that.  But, again, considering the complexity  of

the  system as it is today, I would like to take it step-by-step

and see whether the system works first.  And then later on, once

motorists are more familiar with the system and are more assured

of the reliability, safety and effectiveness of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



the  system, then we can consider further refinements,  such  as

those suggested by Mr Sinnakaruppan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang suggested that the statutory lifespan of

cars   be   extended   to  12  years  and  the   PARF   benefits

correspondingly.  Sir, just let me point out that  private  cars

do  not have a statutory lifespan.  In other words, you can keep

your private car for as long as you want, so long as you pay the

requisite taxes and so long as you pay the COE when it  expires.

So  you  can keep your car indefinitely, unlike taxis where  you

have to scrap the taxi after seven years, unlike buses where you

have to scrap it after 15 years now, unlike rental cars, tuition

cars,  and so on.  Private cars have no statutory lifespan.   So

the  question of extending the statutory lifespan does not apply

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you can introduce an extended PARF scheme. But here I

would  be  cautious because what we have tried to  do  with  our

vehicle  population is to try and keep it  young.   We  have  an

aging  population problem with cars too, because the age of  the

car  population is actually getting older and older every  year.

And  today, about 25% of our cars on the road, one in four  cars

on  the road, is more than 10 years old.  So if we were to relax

on this policy, I think we will see a much greater proliferation

of  old  cars.  And no matter how you look at it, no matter  how

well  you  keep  your  car, there is no  doubt  that,  generally

speaking,  older  cars  are  more likely  to  break  down.   Our

statistics  at the LTA inspection centres show that.   The  AA's

statistics  on  breakdowns on the roads show that.   There  will

always be exceptions.  Many people can keep their old cars very,

very  well.  But the exceptions do not prove the rule.  The rule

is that generally old cars tend to break down more often.  So  I

would hesitate to tinker with this policy because I think it has

served us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, extension of COEs. First of all, we want to

keep the population young.  But I just want to highlight that if

you  extend your COE by two years, chances are that you are just

going to bump up the COE prices, because the life of the COE has

gone  up  by 20%, people are going to factor that in  when  they

next bid.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee suggested that we should lower the ARF

further.  The reason why the Ministry decided not to do this was

because of the very significant knock-on effects of such a move.

As  he realises, when we made the change in 1991, we reduced ARF

from  175%  to 150% at that time.  Very quickly the  COE  prices

rose  in  tandem.  So it is also going to happen this time.   Of

course, people may ask what is wrong with that.  When COE prices

go  up, the prevailing quota premium (PQP) also goes up and that

has an impact on all those who want to renew their COE after  it

has  expired.  So we have decided to err on the side of  caution

as  far  as  this is concerned.  We will reduce, if  any,  on  a

gradual  basis.  For this time, we have decided that a  moderate

10% reduction is sufficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee also made a point about COEs for

motorcycles.  COE prices for motorcycles have fallen  in  recent

months.   In  the  past six months, about 90% of  the  quota  of

motorcycle COEs are actually used to register small bikes, those

engine  capacities of less than 500 cc.  90% of motor bike  COEs

are  actually  used  for small bikes.  So  there  is  really  no

problem  about  small  motorcycle  owners  getting  their  bikes

registered or COEs registered.  In fact, they are the  ones  who

are really determining the price of the COEs, if anything.  So I

do not see any need at this juncture to do the separation.  But,

in  principle, I must say that there is a case to  be  made  for

just  one category for all vehicles.  That is from the transport

point  of view.  We just look at it from that point of view,  we

do  not  need  to  have Categories 1 to 4 for  cars.   But  land

transport tax structure, COEs, is not a straightforward matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we implemented the COE system, we divided it into four

categories because we realised that, at that time, if buyers  of

small cars competed with buyers of large cars, there would be  a

general  sense of unfairness.  For that reason, we have had  the

COE  system of today where there are four categories  and  where

the  price of each category is determined by how many  COEs  are

there  and how much demand there is for each one.  Each category

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



COE  price reflects the price that the motorist in that category

is  prepared to pay.  It is not the Government that decides what

price it is.  It is the buyer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a point that both Dr Wang and Mr Chng Hee Kok

have  made  which I think is valid.  We have had the COE  system

since  1990.   It is timely for us to do a review from  time  to

time.   I agree that we should do a comprehensive review of  the

Vehicle  Quota System this time round.  In so far as  timing  is

concerned,  I think the appropriate time would be when  the  new

vehicle  tax changes are implemented and when the system settles

down a little bit.  Then I think we should do this comprehensive

review  and  when  we  do  that, I would  welcome  any  and  all

suggestions on how we should rationalise the COE system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, I would like to make an announcement

on the COE quota for the quota year May 1998 to April 1999.  The

new   tax  structure  that  was  introduced  together  with  ERP

implementation  as well as the road tax package  will  not  only

allow us to control traffic congestion more effectively but,  as

I  have  repeated,  it  will also give us  this  opportunity  to

increase   the   number  of  COEs  if   traffic  congestion   is

controlled.   I  have announced previously that  we  will  issue

about  15,000  to 20,000 more COEs over the next three  to  four

years  depending on the progress and effectiveness of  ERP.   If

you may recall, we released about 5,500 additional COEs for this

quota  year ending this month, when we extended the Road Pricing

Scheme  to  the  two Expressways, and that was  last  year.   In

conjunction  with  the widening of the Road Pricing  Scheme,  we

released the additional COEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the coming quota year, which is from May 1998 to April

1999,  we  will monitor the traffic patterns after the  ERP  has

been  implemented in the CBD - when we have extended it  to  the

CBD and other RPS points on 1st September - before we decide  on

the  appropriate number of extra COEs to be injected.  Based  on

the current formula for computing COE quota, the total number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



COEs for the next quota year is 47,885 which is higher than  the

current  quota  of 44,813 which included the extra  5,500  COEs.

The  LTA will release details of the quota of the individual COE

categories shortly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the taxi industry. I would like to

thank Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Goh Chee Wee for their support of

the  new  vehicle tax structure.  Mr Seng's concern was how  the

new  structure can be translated to benefit taxi companies, taxi

drivers as well as passengers.  First of all, under the new  tax

structure, all existing taxis will enjoy the reduction in annual

diesel  tax.  The annual diesel tax will be reduced from  $6,600

to  $5,100.   LTA  will  meet the taxi companies  and  the  Taxi

Drivers' Association to work out the details on how taxi drivers

can benefit equitably from these savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I met the taxi drivers in a dialogue session.

They suggested that the savings be used to top up their Medisave

accounts.    I  will  ask  the  taxi  drivers,  taxi  operators,

companies  as well as the Association to put their proposals  to

the LTA and we will discuss together on how this can be done.  I

think it is a good idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng also asked about the future policy of diesel tax.

Will  it  be removed?  First of all, to answer that question,  I

think we must go back to the history of the diesel tax.  What is

the  diesel  tax?   Very simply, it is a  tax  to  equalise  the

difference between tax on diesel and tax on petrol.  The tax  on

diesel  is  very much lower than the tax on petrol at the  pump.

There are many reasons for this.  But that is a fact.  So we try

to make the cost platform for taxis and private cars more equal.

This  is where Mr Jeyaretnam just now asked, why do we tax  taxi

drivers  so high, why do we not just remove the diesel tax,  why

do we not tax it on the same basis as public transport.  Yes, we

are  taxing  taxis  as  public transport  but  not  mass  public

transport  like  buses.   Taxis  are  a  personalised  form   of

transport.   It  is not a substitute for cars and  therefore  it

cannot  be  taxed in the way that Mr Jeyaretnam suggested,  like

public transport, so that we allow everybody to take taxis.  Why

are we making it so expensive for people to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



take taxis?  Taxis are not subsitutes for cars.  But they are  a

form of public transport at the very high end and therefore they

should, on the one hand, pay taxes similar to a car but, on  the

other  hand, be given some concessions in recognition  of  their

public  transport  role.   This we have  done  in  the  new  tax

structure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to impose the diesel tax to equalise this. We

did this many years ago, calculated based on the average mileage

travelled  by taxis.  With ERP, I would expect that the  average

mileage incurred by taxis will go down.  Empty cruising will  be

reduced.    Taxi  drivers  will  be  discouraged  from   driving

unnecessarily  looking for passengers as they  do  today.   They

will  probably have to depend more on radio phones, radio  calls

or  they will have to find some means of pooling their resources

or  whatever.   The fact is that they will have to change  their

mode  of  operation in the same way that other  industries  will

have  to.   If  they  do that effectively  and  if  the  mileage

incurred goes down, then the basis of charging diesel tax, which

is  based  on mileage, also suggests that diesel tax will  trend

downwards.   But  this is really up to the taxi  operators,  how

they drive, how they react to the ERP system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of taxi cartels came up from both Dr Toh See

Kiat  and Mr Iswaran who were concerned that taxi companies  may

form  themselves  into  a  cartel.   Sir,  under  the  new   tax

structure, all taxis receive reduction in diesel tax.  They will

all  receive  road tax rebates.  We design the tax structure  so

that  taxes for taxis, as I said earlier, will be comparable  to

taxes  for  private cars.  The new tax structure also  has  been

configured in such a way that the total cost of registering  and

running a taxi after the new taxes are implemented will  not  be

more  than  what  it is today.  So there is no reason  for  taxi

fares  to  increase  suddenly when they are deregulated  on  1st

September.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect that taxi operators, as Mr Goh Chee Wee has stated

in  this  House  just now, will set their fares sensibly.   They

will  have  to see what the demand is like.  They will  have  to

match supply with demand.  If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>



they  price  their services too high, taxi commuters have  other

choices.   They have got bus and the MRT.  They can opt  not  to

take  a taxi.  If they set their prices too low, then of course,

there  will be overwhelming demand and they will have to  decide

what  is the correct level.  It is a difficult task for the  PTC

to  have to sit in judgement and to decide and arbitrate on taxi

fare  increases every time the taxi operators come  to  the  PTC

with  their  fare increase.  They are not the ones who  run  the

taxi  companies.   They are not the ones who  drive  the  taxis.

They  have to look after the interest of the commuters.  But  in

doing  so, in looking after the interest of the commuters,  they

also  have  to  balance  the need to provide the taxi  companies

with a reasonable return and the taxi operators and drivers with

a  reasonable livelihood.  This is a very difficult  task.   And

every time they sit to arbitrate and decide on this, there is  a

lot  of argument and at the end of the day, nobody is happy with

the result.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is appropriate now that we have set the tax platforms

and   the   tax   structure  correctly,  that  we  return   this

responsibility to the taxi operators and the taxi companies.  Of

course,  I  would  expect taxi operators to be  responsible,  to

recognise their public transport role and the service  to  their

customers in return for the freedom to set their own fares.  The

PTC   will   continue  to  monitor  the  taxi   industry   after

deregulation.   It  will  need to set guidelines  on  taxi  fare

revisions which taxi operators must observe and it will have  to

ensure  that  commuters are given adequate information  to  make

informed choices.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also asked the industry to set minimum standards.

Yes,  the LTA has introduced this performance evaluation  scheme

based   on  several  criteria,  and  it  will  set  the  minimum

performance standards for all taxi operators.  We will watch and

see   what  the  situation  is  like,  how  it  develops   after

deregulation.   We  will observe how the taxi companies  behave,

whether in fact,  they are going to form a cartel to exploit the

customer.    If  necessary,  we  will  further  deregulate   the

industry, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



Dr  Toh  has  suggested, to allow new entrants  to  come  in  to

increase competition, and to let the market decide on the supply

of taxis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai posed the question whether we can make

taxis and car rental companies more attractive as an alternative

to  private cars.  This is, in a way, what we have done with the

new  tax structure.  We have re-looked at SZ cars and taxis  and

made  all  their operating costs roughly more or less the  same.

For  example,  for  new  rental  cars,  we  have  increased  the

statutory  life span from seven years to 10 years.    Taxes  for

taxis,  we  have  treated them more like cars.   Fares  will  be

deregulated.  So the stage is really set for all these different

modes of transport to compete for customers in the way that they

know  best, to offer better service, more comfortable rides,  or

cheaper  fares  on weekdays, Sundays, as Mr Goh  mentioned  just

now.   It  is really up to the taxi companies now and  they  are

free to do so after deregulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tax changes, we are now, in a way, offering more

choices.  We are saying to those people who wish to continue  to

drive a car, here is a new tax package for you, slight reduction

in  upfront taxes, more weightage on usage, you decide what your

lifestyle  is like, which one suits you best.  If you  want  the

door-to-door convenience of a car, you want the reassurance of a

car  whenever you need it, you will buy a car.  If you  want  to

trade  off some of that convenience for savings, you can  either

choose  public  transport  or you can choose  a  combination  of

public transport and private transport.  You can choose to  rent

a car, you can take a cab or you can join a car cooperative.  So

the choice is really up to you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also mentioned that we should convince Singaporeans,

especially  graduates, that it is not possible  to  allow  every

graduate to own a car.  I would like to assure Mr Rai that  this

is what we have been trying to do all these years.  It is not an

easy  dilemma that we have to resolve.  It is a tough  challenge

because, on the one hand, with progress and development,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



rising  expectations invariably mean a demand for cars;  on  the

other hand, a growing demand for travel overall.  So we have  to

resolve this dilemma.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always stressed that cars are not like

HDB flats.  They are a luxury, albeit a legitimate luxury, as  a

recent   Straits   Times  editorial  put  it,   but   a   luxury

nevertheless.   So,  while  the  Government  can  provide  every

household  with  a HDB flat, it cannot guarantee that  everybody

will  own a car.  This is the reason why we have put in so  much

effort  into  building  up public transport, not just  a  public

transport  system that is so-so or can do, but we hope  that  we

will  improve the public transport such that it becomes a viable

alternative to a car for most people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to try and resolve this dilemma. We will

continue  to convince people that public transport is  a  viable

alternative.  But, at the same time, we will continue to try and

meet  this  aspiration for people to own a  car.   That  is  the

reason  why  we  have ERP, because with ERP we  can  allow  more

people to own a car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam said just now that he cannot understand why

we want to issue more COEs.  I could not understand why he could

not  understand  that.  If he has been on the ground  and  going

around  from house to house and talking to people,  I  think  he

will  understand the strong desire of people to want  to  own  a

car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example of how we can meet this aspiration is to

try  and  introduce  what  I  call more  personalised  transport

services.   Under this category, I refer to taxis,  rental  cars

and, recently, to the car cooperative scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is just one last point that I have not

addressed yet, and this is on Dr Toh See Kiat's question on  the

cost   effectiveness   of  underground   roads   and   flyovers.

Basically,  we  have  to build underground  roads  and  flyovers

because  of limited land.  There are many junctions in Singapore

today  which are very heavily used.  It is no longer  sufficient

to  just  have  a two-tier flyover.  We need to have  three-tier

flyovers,  because  of  the  heavy  flow  of  traffic   in   all

directions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about criteria. We have to take into account

traffic volumes and traffic flows.  We have to take into account

the  site  constraints.   We  have  to  take  into  account  the

topography.  We have to take into account the value of the  land

in  the  area,  whether we go over or under, and so  on  and  so

forth.   These are some of the considerations that  have  to  be

taken  into  account.  The Holland Road three-tier  interchange,

for  example,  was  selected  after taking  these  factors  into

consideration.   Design  studies were  made,  evaluated  against

various  criteria and the final choice was made.  Basically,  we

needed  more three-tier interchanges because we have to  relieve

the  existing traffic congestion at these junctions, and because

it  is  part and parcel of our plan to optimise the use  of  our

roads.  Junctions are where bottlenecks occur.  So when we  have

major  traffic  arteries,  we  have  to  make  sure  that  those

bottlenecks are removed.  Otherwise, we are under-utilising  our

roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me just conclude by taking this opportunity to

remind  Members that our land transport policy is not  just  ERP

alone.   Over  the last so many minutes, I have  been  answering

queries  about  ERP, but it is not just ERP.  It is  about  more

choices for the public in terms of good public transport.  It is

about  expanding the road  network.  It is about building three-tier  interchanges.  It is about managing our roads  to  relieve

congestion.   It is about issuing more COEs so that more  people

can  aspire  to own cars.  Since we debated the White  Paper  on

Land  Transport in this House in 1996, we have achieved  a  lot,

but  a  lot  more needs to be done.  I am confident that  as  we

press  on  with the implementation of the various  policies  and

schemes  that have been mapped out in this White Paper, we  will

achieve  our vision of a world-class land transport  system  for

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, last year, I raised the question of

community-based bus services.  I would like to  raise  it  again

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC, in the recent Government announcement, has

liberalised many features of public transport including taxi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>



regulations.   I hope this is a step in the right direction  and

more  such deregulation and control can be given for efforts  to

improve community bus services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, bus services in housing estates and so

on  feeding to the main routes, trunk routes and MRT routes  are

done  on a restricted feeder bus service.  Very often, residents

find that feeder bus services over a period of time diminish and

disappear,  leaving many residents rather unhappy.   Because  of

the PTC's regulatory regime, it is difficult for anybody just on

his  own to come up with some idea or entrepreneurial effort  to

organise or to form companies for bus services.  But I  hope  it

can be considered within this context that communities which are

interested  in  providing  better services  for  their  members,

residents, families and children going to school can,  on  their

own  initiative with entrepreneurial effort and perhaps  private

entrepreneurial capital, be given this chance to run  this  kind

of  service  within their community.  With that, it  can  really

answer  the needs of that community of people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope

the Ministry of Communications will consider this.

<br>4.42 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the work of the Public Transport

Council  is important, in that it sets the tone for bus services

as   well   as   taxis.   I  am  glad  that  the  Minister   has

comprehensively covered taxis, and I will not take  the  House's

time on that.  But I would like to highlight one aspect of PTC's

work, ie, bus services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think at the last Budget sitting, two Members of this

House,  Dr  Michael Lim and Mr Chay, spoke on  this  issue.   My

concern is: why is PTC so rigid in maintaining 40% of the  buses

should  be non-air-conditioned service?  With growing affluence,

I  think more people want to have air-conditioned buses and  the

ratio should be changed, maybe to 70:30 or even 80:20.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern is on Scheme B buses. Maybe the

Government  wants to make a study to see whether they  could  be

organised into a cooperative or some close-knit group.   Because

they are providing a valuable service for the bus commuters.   I

think we should appreciate and we should encourage them to  form

cooperatives.   I  remember years back in  the  70s,  a  lot  of

Chinese  bus companies were amalgamated.  I know these are  one-man  and two-men operations, but some economic incentives  could

be given to them.  They could then serve a very useful purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I totally agree with the Minister that we have to

depend  on public transport.  But the question that we  have  to

ask ourselves is that until we have improved  and I must concede

that  we  have improved  when are we going to come to the  stage

when  the  people who are using taxis and cars will be persuaded

to  switch.   On the MRT, I already notice that members  of  the

public  take  a trip on the MRT during the lunch hour.   I  have

seen MPs, senior civil servants, and bankers, but I have yet  to

see  somebody taking the bus.  Maybe it is too long a  distance.

Now,  we  have  bus  shelters,  but  the  time  factor  is  also

important.   For some bus services, the wait is  more  than  7-8

minutes, and the MRT is about 3-4 minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PTC could work out a scheme whereby it ensures a

minimum   service,  I  think  the  public  would  change   their

travelling  pattern.   The  PTC  should  also  consult  the  bus

commuters and get feedback from them.  It should listen  to  the

taxi  operators.   They are an organised group.   Unfortunately,

the   bus   and   MRT   commuters  are  not  organised   groups.

Nevertheless, the PTC should carry out a survey and get feedback

to find out what are their needs, and whether the fare structure

they  are  going  to  set is actually one  that  will  meet  the

public's  expectations.   Of  course,  the  public  wants  cheap

travel,  but  it  cannot be so, because the  economic  necessity

dictates that economic forces work.  What I am suggesting to the

Minister is that he should organise with PTC.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other complaint I have against the composition of PTC

is  that I do not think any of the members of the PTC comes from

the bus commuters.  They all look like the car-owning class.   I

would  suggest that they should at least put one or two  members

who depend on public transport.  And I suppose this will help in

giving the correct feedback.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, my topic is on

construction of pedestrian crossings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 217 pedestrians were either injured or killed

while  using  zebra  and signalised pedestrian  crossings.   The

common  causes of these accidents are failure to  look  out  and

failure of vehicles giving way to pedestrians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zebra crossings, which used to be a safe mode of crossing

for   pedestrians,  have  become  a  potential  accident   spot.

Sometimes  the  crossings  create  bottlenecks  in  our  traffic

system.  The following are some observations at zebra crossings:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Pedestrians simply assume "absolute right of way" without

due regard to their own safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Some take their own sweet time to cross the zebra crossing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) At certain zebra crossings, the stream of pedestrians is

almost  non-stop, thus making it impossible for any  traffic  to

pass through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) At night, it is difficult for motorists to see pedestrians

at some of these crossings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above situations cause congestion on our roads, and

also traffic accidents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Ministry has been closely

monitoring the situation and has taken various measures.  I hope

the  Minister could update the House on the measures taken.   At

the  same  time, I would urge the Ministry to conduct a thorough

study  to determine the possibility of replacing zebra crossings

with other forms of crossings that are safer to pedestrians.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over the

past two to three years, the Ministry of Communications and  LTA

have vastly improved the transport system in Singapore, and  the

livelihood of the people is thereby improved.   This  is  indeed

commendable.  MRT and LRT are also being developed and a lot  of

above-ground and underground projects have been completed.   Our

bus and taxi services have also improved.  This  can be said  to

be  one  good  news after another.  Whether we drive  along  the

roads  or  commute  by  public transport,  we  cannot  help  but

appreciate all these rapid developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the Government had been

collecting money all the time.   I think he is wrong  in  saying

so.    The  facts show that the Government has been making  good

use  of   the  taxes collected to  improve our living conditions

and social amenities.  The Government has already done all this.

We  have  accumulated  strong  reserves through years of prudent

financial  management to ensure that  we  can  tide  over   this

economic and financial turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, the Ministry of Communications announced

that  they  were  going  to build a new MRT  station  near   the

Singapore  Polytechnic.   This  shows  that  the  Government  is

determined  to  meet the needs in our public  transport.   As  a

labour  MP, I hope that, apart from looking after the  needs  of

students, the Government should also consider the needs  of  the

workers.   In  this regard, I hope that the LTA would   consider

building   MRT stations in the industrial estates.  For example,

we  should  consider  building a MRT station  on  the  Woodlands

extension  line,  near the Sungei Kadut industrial  estate,  for

the benefit of the workers there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the implementation of the ERP system, especially

in   the  CBD,  I  hope that the Ministry of Communications  can

consider   giving  the  environmental  vehicles   some   special

concessions, especially the garbage trucks.  Rebates  should  be

given to them or to allow them to pay a  fixed monthly rate,  so

that  our  environmental workers will not be adversely  affected

because  their companies have to face the rising cost under  the

new system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Sir, I would like to declare my

interest  as  a  director of a construction company.   With  the

impending introduction of ERP system, we are going to see a more

accurate  pricing in road use from a partial shift  of  charging

for car ownership to charging for usage of road.  I use the word

"partial"  because any user of ERP still has to own a  car,  and

that  is,  you  still have to pay for COE, road tax,  ARF,  etc.

Even  when  he  is  not driving, the cost is  still  taken  into

account every minute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the ERP represents the state-of-the-art in

vehicular traffic management and we should unreservedly  commend

LTA for their bold effort to move in that direction.  But I wish

to  point  out  that we already have in place  a  transportation

system  which charges usage even more accurately,  and  that  is

none other than our transit system (MRT).  The users pay for the

MRT  as  taxpayers and they pay as and when they use.   If  they

choose  to  stay at home or walk to work, he bears  no  variable

cost.   And  this concept adheres very closely to the  tenet  of

pricing theory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice this year, other than those already approved

projects, the Budget has no special provision for building  more

MRT  or  LRT  systems.  It is surprising that  a  government  as

shrewd  as the Singapore Government does not recognise the  rare

opportunity  to embark on more MRT and LRT construction  in  the

face of this regional economic slowdown.  The justifications for

building  more  of  these projects are  quite  obvious.   May  I

quickly cover some of these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tremendous slowdown in construction activities

in  East  Asia.  The construction materials are very cheap  now.

Lots  of  equipment  are lying around idle.   Big  international

construction  companies are very hungry for jobs.   The  overall

construction  cost index has dropped 10-20%.  If we  build  now,

our  cost  on investment would be lower and that would  mean  we

would get a higher rate of return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also this substitution effect between road usage

and transit usage.  If our network of transit system is more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>



convenient  and  less costly to use, the commuters  will  switch

from  using  cars to using the transit system.  This  phenomenon

can  be  clearly seen in Hong Kong, New York, London,  etc.   As

more   people switch to the transit system, the economic  return

on  the  transit  system would be better and,  hence,  make  the

system more viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, a more comprehensive transit system

would  benefit the nation as a whole.  We definitely spend  less

foreign  reserves to import cars and petroleum year after  year.

We  also  have  less  air and noise pollution.   Our  population

possibly  will spend less time on the road, suffering less  from

the  stress  of  driving, spending more time  resting,  or  even

reading on the train, etc.  These are the intangibles and softer

factors  that  are  hard  to quantify  but  clearly  beneficial,

especially when we strive to move towards a more civic society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past week, many Members of this House have pointed

out  that  many  of  our  companies are badly  affected  by  the

regional  crisis.  If the Government implements  more  MRT,  LRT

projects  now,  it  will help to prime the economy  and  provide

reliefs  to our companies.  And coupled with the points  I  have

pointed out earlier, it is a win-win proposal for the Government

to  do  more now.  Before I end, I would like to point out  that

not  only  the transit system would use less land for a specific

traffic  volume,  it actually would enhance the  value  of  land

along  the  corridor of the system, and such  enhancement  to  a

large extent will offset the construction cost of the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Sir, I am not calling here for more

construction of MRT and LRT for the sake of economic stimulation

without  regard  to  the long-term viability  of  the  projects.

Singapore has one of the highest density of population per sq km

in  the  world.  Big cities like London or Paris have  a  bigger

cosmopolitan area, lesser high- rise residential buildings,  yet

they  operate  some very efficient transit systems.   I  believe

townships  like  Tampines or Ang Mo Kio have  enough  population

density to justify some viable LRT system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, infrastructure work such as MRT or LRT is an

asset.   It  is  not  an  expenditure  per  se.   Building  this

infrastructure is equivalent to converting cash in  the  balance

sheet  into  a  useful asset.  And I call  on  the  Minister  to

consider  expanding our MRT and LRT network now, so as to  cater

for future increase in demand when the good times return.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are 10 more speakers. "Guillotine"

time is 5.20 pm.  Mr Mah.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, Mr Chay proposed that we allow

private  companies to run their own bus services.  I would  just

like to enlighten him that we have actually been doing that, ie,

allowing  private  bus  operators to operate  scheduled  shuttle

services.   Currently, there are about 28 such services  run  by

Scheme  B  and they supplement the regular services of  SBS  and

TIBS.   But  in  addition to that, there  are  also  19  private

shuttle  services at the moment.  Another 10 will be added  once

developments   are  ready.   And  they  operate   from   private

condominiums, commercial centres linking to MRT stations and bus

interchanges.  They are provided by the management committees of

the  private estates for the use of their residents or  for  the

use  of  their  customers.  On top of that,  there  are  private

factories  which  supply bus services for  their  workers.   All

these  supplementary services play a useful role  in  connecting

services  from  the specific destination to the  main  transport

system.  PTC would welcome any organisation that wishes to apply

to  operate  these services, if they find it feasible  and  cost

effective to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific point about whether they should run feeder

services in HDB estates, if that is what Mr Chay has in mind,  I

would add a word of caution.  At the current fares, many of  the

feeder  services in the housing estates are not profitable  and,

in  fact, they are being cross-subsidised by the trunk services.

So  while PTC may not have anything in principle against  having

such  services  run in the HDB estates, I think there  would  be

very  limited scope or incentive for other operators  to  either

run   fully,  or  on  a  supplemental  basis,  these   services.

Nevertheless, if any grassroots organisation or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>



town  councils wish to run these services within their  estates,

and  if they think that they can make it viable, they can submit

their  proposals to PTC for consideration.  But I would like  to

reiterate  this word of caution - that it is not a  money-making

proposition as such, because it is actually part of  the  bigger

public  transport  network  that  the  scheduled  bus  operators

operate, and there is a fair element of cross-subsidy involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai made some useful comments about the Public Transport

Council.   Let me address them.  On the question of  the  Public

Transport Council being rigid, I think, first of all, he may not

be  aware  that the PTC's limit on air-conditioned  services  is

actually no longer there.  In fact, the lid has been lifted.  It

used  to be 40%.  Now, I think it has been brought down to  20%,

and  eventually probably it will be lifted altogether.  But that

is  in  a  way  reflective of the situation that the  PTC  finds

itself  in.  Because, on the one hand, there is this  school  of

thought that says, "Look, Singapore is a modern society,  it  is

very  hot,  let's  air-condition  all  the  buses.   People  are

prepared  to  pay  for  it."  And on the other  hand,  there  is

another  not  insignificant group which says, "Look,  we  cannot

afford to pay the 10 or 20 cents more for air-conditioned buses.

We  don't mind waiting for a non-airconditioned bus because this

means  a  lot to me, and I cannot afford to pay."  So  there  is

still a small group of people, not insignificant, who would like

to  keep some buses in the fleet non-airconditioned and charging

a  lower  fare.   The PTC has to recognise this  and  take  into

account  this feedback and, therefore, it has had  to  put  this

limit  of 20% on airconditioned buses.  But over time,  I  would

expect  that this limit will be reduced and eventually  it  will

disappear  completely.   But PTC is  not  being  rigid.   It  is

actually  being very sensitive to the different requirements  of

different sectors of the bus commuting public.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there should be a minimum service standard for

buses,  yes,  there is actually a minimum service  standard  for

buses  and  this  minimum service standard is reflected  in  the

minimum waiting times,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>



minimum  headways, maximum distance between bus  stops,  minimum

number of services in an estate, and so on and so forth.   Those

minimum   service  standards  are  already  in  place  and   are

applicable to all our scheduled bus operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the PTC is well-organised to take into account

different  groups of people, I would say that its  members  come

from all walks of life, including the labour movement, academia,

professionals and grassroots organisations.  It includes  people

who  drive to work and people who take public transport to work.

I  can  assure  Mr  Rai that when the Public  Transport  Council

meets,  the Chairman has actually quite a tough time  trying  to

reconcile all the different interest groups represented by those

members in his Council.  And I must say that he is doing a  very

good  job considering the difficulties involved.  But the Public

Transport  Council can always do with more fresh  ideas.   So  I

would  ask  Mr Rai, if he agrees, that perhaps I should  appoint

him  to the Public Transport Council.  Unfortunately, he is  not

here  to give me an answer straightaway.  But I will ask him  in

the Members' Room later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked whether we can consider replacing zebra

crossings  with other safer forms of crossings.   Yes,  the  LTA

tells  me  that there are many different types of crossings  and

they have different users.  Whether you have a zebra crossing or

a  traffic  light crossing or overhead bridge really depends  on

where,  on how much traffic, site constraints, and so on and  so

forth.  So where it is possible and feasible, they will consider

replacing  it.   But  it  is not advisable  to  have  a  blanket

guideline  or ruling to say that we do away with zebra crossings

altogether.  They do serve their purpose.  There is a  need  for

education  to  make sure that pedestrians know how  to  use  the

zebra  crossings safely and motorists also know how to  approach

the zebra crossings safely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about the garbage trucks. He asked

whether we could give garbage trucks some concessions.  I  think

I  have made some comments on that earlier.  Generally speaking,

we apply the ERP charges to all vehicles and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>



we  expect  the vehicle owners to either absorb, adapt  or  find

some  other ways.  Basically, the message to all vehicle owners,

fleet  owners, bus operators, taxi operators is that  they  have

got  to  live with ERP.  They have to get used to it. They  have

got  to  adapt  to  it.   There is  nothing  to  be  afraid  of.

Basically, there are many organisations that have learned how to

adapt and taxi companies for one and I believe others, including

the garbage collectors, will also learn how to adapt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about additional MRT stations. Yes, we are

looking  at  traffic  volumes along all the existing  lines  and

looking at whether we can justify the building of additional MRT

stations  like  what we have done for the Singapore  Polytechnic

station.   The space was allocated to the Singapore  Polytechnic

station  on  the  North-South line but at that time,  the  study

showed  that  the  volume did not justify.   But  now  with  the

polytechnic  fully completed and the student  population  up  to

something like, I believe, 15,000 or thereabouts, it has  become

viable  to  build  and  operate that station  at  the  Singapore

Polytechnic.  That is the reason why after a feasibility  study,

we  have  decided to go ahead to build the Singapore Polytechnic

station.   We will do similar studies for other existing  lines.

We will do it together with other statutory boards, JTC, URA and

HDB.   And  if  the  ridership justifies,  yes,  we  will  build

additional  stations.  But it has to be justified  on  ridership

grounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chuang Shaw Peng suggested that the LTA speed

up  the expansion of the MRT-LRT system, basically to capitalise

on the lower construction cost arising from the current economic

situation.   I  have  said many times in  this  House  that  the

Government is committed to building a world-class land transport

system  based  on a public transport which is very  comfortable,

very  efficient, very cost effective and which can offer a  good

alternative  to  cars.   And  that public  transport  system  is

basically  the  rapid  transit  system,  rail-based  system,  as

opposed to public bus system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we already have a very extensive network of rail-based system. We have about 83 km of track. We carry about 1

million passengers a day.  When we first started the system,  we

were  talking  about  250,000.  Today, we are  talking  about  1

million  passengers  per day.  It is a very  well  used  system,

viable, profitable, well-run, efficient.  So it has attracted  1

million  passengers, many of whom, as Mr Rai  pointed  out  just

now,  are people who are car owners who use the MRT for some  of

their  trips,  and that is as it should be.  So we  will  expand

this   network  further.   We  will  expand  it  as  our   urban

development  expands,  as  more new  towns  are  built,  as  the

downtown area is developed, and as more new centres of work  and

population develop.  That is definitely on the cards.  But every

line  we  build,  every station we build has to be  economically

justified.  It cannot be a luxury.  It has to be justified.  And

that is why in good times and in bad, we are able to justify and

proceed with the building of the MRT or LRT system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the LTA plans to do is to implement an average of one

rapid  transit system a year.  And if we can sustain this  rate,

in 10 years' time, we will be doubling our network from 83 km to

something  like 150 km of rail.  That is a very, very  ambitious

plan,  I must add.  Because we will be doing what many countries

have taken something like 30 to 50 years.  In 10 to 15 years, we

will  be  building what other countries took 30 to 50  years  to

build.  That is the kind of pace that we hope to sustain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Chuang pointed out, yes, the current economic crisis

does present us with opportunities, more competitive prices  for

one.   But  at the same time, we have to factor in the weakening

of  the Singapore dollar because some of the contracts and  some

of  the equipment actually come in US dollars and other European

currencies.  So we will have to do the weighing.  But  LTA  will

monitor the situation very carefully, see what advantages we can

reap from this situation and seize the opportunity where we can.

And  if  we find it advantageous and the sums are in our favour,

yes we will speed up the implementation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Recently, the harbour tug services in

the  port  have been privatised and I hope this is the beginning

of many other downstream services that can be privatised for the

port.  In introducing competition to the port services, this  is

a  good  way to keep the port efficient.  So terminal  handling,

berth  services, even distribution centre services, are examples

of  such  downstream services that we can  do  with  a  dose  of

invigorating competition.  This task is particularly urgent  now

when  the  exchange rates of some of our neighbouring  countries

who have been building ports have been lowered.  We can see that

once  they begin to recover, their competition will become  very

keen.   So I hope that our port services will continue to  raise

their  competitiveness in this respect.  The MPA could  consider

privatising more of the downstream services soon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, first,

I  would  like  to  declare my interest as I  am  working  in  a

logistics and forwarding company, not a local one though.  But I

would  like to ask that more be done to support local  transport

logistics  providers.  I think we can be proud of  our  airport,

our  seaport and world class national airline and shipping line.

We  want  to  be,  and  we are already, a regional  distribution

centre  but  I  feel  that more should be  done  to  help  local

forwarders  to upgrade themselves.  In the last many  years,  if

you look at the top IATA forwarders in Singapore, about 10, only

one  is a Singapore company.  This has been so for the last  few

years and I do not see many changes taking place in the next few

years unless major strategic initiatives are taken to help local

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that unless local companies are

able  to  rise  to  this challenge and to complement  the  solid

infrastructure that we have, we will find ourselves difficult to

meet  the  competition, especially in some regional cities  that

have  expressed interest in wanting to also be a  regional  hub.

It is also not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>



surprising to note that a lot of the local companies  today  are

finding  it  difficult  to  compete  and  meet  with  the  total

logistics  requirements of multi-national companies where  their

requirements have crossed the global and regional span.   So  we

really need to do something about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have got two suggestions. One is to establish strong

alliances between Government-owned and GLCs with local companies

so  that  local  companies have the experience  to  upgrade  and

participate  in bigger contracts.  Secondly, when  PSA  recently

announced  a  joint  venture  with  a  large  German  automotive

logistics firm, I would have thought it be appropriate  to  also

include local companies to be involved and gain some experience.

Thirdly,  maybe  we  could  establish  more  forwarder  linkages

between  Singapore  and other major distribution  centres  where

certain very expensive infrastructure that can be built  by  the

Government  can  be  shared  by  local  companies  who  find  it

extremely prohibitive to set up on their own, especially when we

talk about IT network and all.  Fourthly, perhaps, we could  use

our  strong  bilateral  relations with other  countries  in  the

region  to  have certain exemptions with regard to the  existing

bureaucratic and customs practices that some of the countries in

the  region impose on goods that are transhipped from Singapore.

On  the  whole, I hope we could do a lot more so that the  local

industries can be upgraded.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, again, I will be brief. The question

I    have   is   with   regard    to   the   liberalisation   of

telecommunication  services and the cheaper infrastructure  that

we  could  put in to allow for electronic commerce.  Firstly,  I

would  like  the Minister to give this House an  update  on  the

progress  of  obtaining the third mobile and second  fixed  line

operator,  and whether there are any further plans to liberalise

post and telecommunications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have had complaints about the service standards of

our  Internet service providers and also about the high cost  of

lease line services.  These are costs that people would have  to

bear if they go into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>



electronic commerce.  If we are to become an electronic commerce

hub,   we   need   to  ensure  inexpensive  but   high   quality

telecommunication infrastructure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr John Chen, you have five minutes to reply.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun):</b> Sir, Dr Toh asked when the PSA Corporation will be

privatised.  PSA was corporatised in October 1997.  The Ministry

will monitor the development of the corporatised PSA closely and

decide on when it should be privatised at a later date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked that we introduce more competition in port

services.  Yes, the MPA has already taken steps to open to  more

service  providers.   He mentioned about  the  towage  services.

This was introduced in the beginning of March, and they will  be

doing more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli suggests to the Government how to help the

local logistics companies to compete.  The suggestions given  by

him  are good ones.  In fact, the Government has already started

some  of  these things that he has mentioned.  Let me just  give

you  some examples.  For instance, the Logistics Enhancement and

Applications Programme (LEAP) administered by the TDB.  If he is

interested  about this programme, I will get the  TDB  to  brief

him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On providing linkages to facilitate quick and efficient

movement  of  goods,   TDB, EDB and Customs have  put  in  place

various  IT  systems  to help freight forwarders  and  logistics

service  providers  to  improve their speed  and  efficiency  in

handling goods.  Some examples include TradeNet Plus, which is a

national IT framework to cover the entire international  trading

chain,  from  locating  a  product, compliance  with  regulatory

requirements,  to  the delivery of the product using  electronic

means.  Another example is Spectrum.  It is a national air cargo

community  system  which  enables automated  exchange  of  cargo

information   among  airlines,  cargo  agents   and   Government

agencies, both locally and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>



internationally.  Such a system helps our local companies  track

their  shipments without having to set up their own  IT  network

overseas which, as Mr Zulkifli has mentioned,  is expensive.  So

they can ride on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides upgrading the local companies, the Government is

also  facilitating companies in expanding their  global  network

and  such  efforts  are  targeted  both  at  the  government  to

government level, eg, at ASEAN fora, such as the ASEAN Framework

of  Services,  and  also at the company level,  where  potential

partners and users are matched with local companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh asked about the status of the further liberalisation

of  telecom  services.  The tenders for up to  two  more  public

basic  telecommunication service licences and  up  to  two  more

public cellular mobile telephone service licences were closed on

31st  December 1997.  There were altogether three and  two  pre-qualified tenderers respectively in the two categories.  TAS  is

now  in  the  midst  of the tender evaluation process  and  will

announce the results by mid-1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also asked about the quality of the Internet

service.  The Internet market has been liberalised in Singapore.

The  three  Internet service providers (ISPs) and the  many  re-sellers have launched very competitive price schemes to meet the

needs of different users, depending on their usage requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet service providers are also required to comply

with TAS' strict quality of service standards.  For example,  in

the  last  quarter  of  1997, all the three  ISPs  exceeded  the

quality  of service levels imposed by TAS.  In fact, the quality

of  service  achieved by our ISPs ranks among the  best  in  the

industry.  Our users here, therefore, get good value for  money.

But there could be further improvements for the ISPs such as  in

their  marketing effort and customer relations.   No  doubt  the

ISPs will strive to improve further, considering the competitive

environment they are in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for leased line services, independent reports and

monitoring   by   TAS  suggest  that  our  present   rates   are

competitive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>



Although there were some complaints about high leased line cost,

we  found that in these cases the comparisons were not  made  on

the  same  basis.   According to surveys by Data  Communication,

SingTel   is  already  the  price  leader  when  it   comes   to

international  leased line hubbing in the Asia-Pacific  compared

to   other  carriers  in  traditional  hub  locations  such   as

Australia, Hong Kong and Japan.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody has a view on the property market. At the

right  price, we can be either a seller or a buyer.  Singapore's

home  ownership  policy has made almost  everyone  here  a  home

owner.   Many  non-home  owners today  are  also  aspiring  home

owners.   It is no wonder then that when the property prices  go

up too fast, or come down too fast, we get some people angry and

frustrated, while, at the same time, others may be laughing  all

the way to the bank.  Unfortunately, those who are happy because

they  are  better off are usually silent, while  those  who  are

affected  adversely tend to be very vocal.  They  express  their

views  publicly  and lobby Government officials and  the  media.

Very often, the noise generated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>



and  the perceived vested interests of the lobbies make it  hard

to see the gravity of the real situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not everyone can agree whether the price of the

property market today is high or low or at just the right price,

all  of us agree, I believe, that we need some stability in  the

property   market.    The  property  price  index   of   private

residential  properties  doubled from about  150  in  the  first

quarter  of 1993 to over 300 in the second quarter of 1996,   in

just  over  three  years.  The Government was perceived  by  the

general public then to have been slow in reacting to the runaway

prices then.  Since its peak in the second quarter of 1996, when

anti-speculation measures were introduced by the Government, the

index  has  only dropped about 16.5%.  We are now  back  to  the

first quarter of 1995 levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price stability in the property market is important as it

affects  credit facilities by banks and financial  institutions.

It   influences  sentiments  and  also  the  herd  mentality  of

speculators and investors alike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has a duty to do its utmost to stabilise the

property  market.  The property prices may still  be  considered

high  today relative to the early 1990s.  However, it is  in  no

one's  interest  to  see it crash, as the  consequences  on  the

entire  economy may be disastrous.  The Government  has  already

introduced  several  measures such as deferring  the  Government

land  sales  programme, extending the project completion  period

for  Government land sales sites and suspending the  stamp  duty

surcharge  on contracts for the sale of properties within  three

years of purchase to stabilise the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I would like to ask the Minister is: what

else  does he plan to do to stabilise the market if it goes down

drastically  further?  At the same time, the  Government  should

also  think of measures to prevent the market, after it  bottoms

out,  from running away again, as it did between 1993 and  1996.

What  will the Minister do to prevent this from happening again?

This is important as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>



I  believe  the public expects the Government to be  even-handed

and respond as quickly to an upturn as it had been to a downturn

in the market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I have spoken during the budget

debate  about relaxing the cash downpayment for the purchase  of

private  properties  from 20% to 10%,  to  help  aspiring  young

professionals  to become first-time owners of private  property.

And given the slow down in the property market, this offers them

a good golden opportunity to catch their rainbow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Richard Hu, in his reply, dismissed it when he said that

the  banks cannot over expose themselves to the property sector,

and  that home buyers should not be highly geared.  Dr  Hu  also

turned down Mr Choo Wee Khiang's plea to use CPF savings in lieu

of  cash,  because  the  CPF goes back to  the  buyer  when  the

property is sold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure if Government understands that I am

talking  about a very small pool of young professionals who  are

first-time buyers, maybe 10,000 or much less.  I support all the

anti-speculation  measures the Government has implemented.   But

what  I  am  talking now is for first-time buyers of properties,

and not speculators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Government's answer to meet the aspirations

of  this small group of people has been through the introduction

of   the  Executive  Condominiums  (ECs).   But  we  know   from

experience  that  young professionals prefer private  properties

for  various  reasons.    Even  so, the  Government  could  also

consider  the  relaxation of this 20% rule for  applications  of

ECs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, maybe I am pre-empting the Minister's answer by saying

that  going by his past replies, he could probably say,  "Please

channel  your  request  to the Minister  for  Finance."   He  is

absolutely right.  The plea that I am making to the Minister  is

that   he  is  also the Chairman of the National Youth  Council.

Therefore,  I  would like to appeal to him on  behalf  of  young

professionals  who have a real chance of chasing their  rainbows

now, in this soft market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Chairman of the GPC has just pointed out, the

prices are holding at 1995 prices.  If this proposal is allowed,

these  first-time potential owners may get lower  prices  during

the  soft  market situation.  And it is not a question of  these

professionals  over extending their credit,  as  some  reporters

have  written over the weekend.  They have hard assets, but  not

so much cash, and that is their problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not convinced with Dr Hu's argument that the

relaxation  of  the policy would unduly over expose  the  banks,

because  the number of this target group that I am speaking  for

is very, very small to affect the banks in any big way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister will not dismiss this plea.

I hope that I can persuade him so that he can persuade the other

Ministers in the Cabinet and help these young talents.   And  as

Dr  Lee  Boon  Yang  had said yesterday,  local  talent  is  the

foundation of Singapore and I think we should put more  emphasis

on them before we find more ways of drawing foreign talent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the nexus

between the private property market and public housing is clear.

This is especially so for Singapore where home ownership is more

than  90%.   We  know that the private property prices  have  an

effect on public housing and vice versa.  Thus, the need for the

Government  and  the Ministry of National Development  to  tread

carefully on this plain.  It was, therefore, very reassuring  to

see  how Prime Minister Goh handled the issue of upholding  high

standards  when MP Mr Heng Chiang Meng, the former President  of

REDAS,  was caught in the tricky position about Government  land

sales  and  the  property market.  In the words of  the  Straits

Times editorial, Mr Heng, I quote, "did the honourable thing" by

quitting  as  the  REDAS  President and resigning  as  Executive

Director of Far East Organisation, which is Singapore's  biggest

developer.   PM  Goh, in making public his exchange  of  letters

with  Mr  Heng,  brought relief to many for  it  reinforced  the

belief in the transparency and accountability of our system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister, Sir, what further assurances would

MND  give  to  ensure public confidence in its transparency  and

accountability   would   be   preserved,   if   not,   enhanced?

Specifically,  what are the critical considerations  that  would

determine MND's policy on land sales?  What effect do you expect

land  sales  to  have on current property prices,  both  on  the

private property and public housing?  And finally, if I may  ask

the  Minister, what effect did the Ministry's adjustments to the

private residential policies announced last November have on our

property market?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the property market in land scarce

countries  like Singapore has a direct impact on  the  country's

economy.  As property prices increase steeply, it creates  asset

price inflation, as we have seen in Singapore from 1992 to 1996.

Asset  price  inflation translates to higher rental or  property

purchase costs, so business costs go up.  This increase in  cost

has  to  be  passed  on  to the customers,  so  ultimately,  the

consumers  see  an  increase  in  expenditure.   To  afford  the

increased  expenditure, individuals need to have more  cash  and

hence  need higher wages.  For individuals, they have to  pay  a

higher  price to own or rent a property.  To be able  to  afford

these  higher prices, they need higher wages, so the total  wage

costs  go up.  This creates a direct impact on the cost of doing

business  in Singapore.  Sir, this is a vicious circle  and  the

root cause of the problem is asset price inflation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few days of debate, we have been told many

times that wage cost is the real issue affecting the rising cost

of  doing business here.  I agree with this, but this is,  as  I

have  analysed  earlier, just the symptom of the  real  problem,

which  is  asset  price inflation.  Sir, this  is  one  way  the

property  prices  affect our economy.  On the other  hand,  many

businesses  and individuals have invested heavily in properties.

Should  the property price bubble burst, there will be a  sudden

devaluation  of their assets.  Banks may ask for  repayments  to

bridge  the  loss  of  value or, worse  still,  force  sell  the

properties to recover whatever residual value they can have, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>



the case of very heavy borrowings.  Book value of company assets

would also be much reduced.  As an example, we can look at  what

happened in Japan, about seven years ago, when the bubble burst.

The  economy in Japan is still having problems recovering.   We,

therefore,  must  hope  that  the  bubble  does  not  burst   in

Singapore.   However,  this does not mean that  property  prices

should  not  be  allowed to slide downwards at  a  steady  rate.

Letting  a little air out of the balloon may be a healthy  thing

to do, to reduce the growing tension and strains on the property

market and hence our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the property market, like many sectors of our economy,

is  a cyclical one, we have seen the peak in 1996 and now prices

are coming down, heading towards a trough.  This cyclical effect

is  not  necessarily  bad,  as we have  a  chance  to  make  due

corrections to an inflated market.  However, if we intervene too

early during the downside, we may risk artificially propping the

market  up at unsustainable levels in the long term.  The effect

will  be seen many years from now if we allow a new higher  base

to  be  set now.  In the next upturn, the prices will  start  to

increase  from this higher base when they should have, in  fact,

started  from a more realistic lower level should market  forces

have been allowed to determine the prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been recent calls by certain developer groups to

lift  the measures put in by the Government in May 1996 and also

calls to further stimulate the property sector.  I would like to

request  the Minister for National Development not to  lift  the

measures  that  have  been  very  effective.   It  was  recently

reported  in  the  Straits Times that all the  major  developers

still  expect to make a comfortable margin in their  profits  in

1997,  despite making provisions for losses due to unsold units,

and  this comes after two years of record profits for them.   We

have already seen some of the corporate results in the last  few

days to confirm this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, therefore, should stick to its original

objectives and fundamental strategy to curb speculation  in  the

property  market, whether times are good or bad.   Any  measures

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>



puts  in  place should be long term focused, to give the general

direction  and it should avoid constantly interfering  to  avoid

jerking  the  property  market around with  many  piecemeal  and

seemingly uncoordinated measures, sometimes affecting the demand

and  sometimes affecting the supply, as I have said in my Budget

speech.  So I feel that the Minister should not have changed the

land  sales policy.  In fact, if the market knows the volume  of

land  available  year after year, the market  would  have  taken

these  into  account.  Therefore, in the long term, this  should

not be a major factor affecting property prices.  So I feel that

the land sales should have continued in the last two quarters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other issue I have, with the recent announcement of tax

exemption  for land under development, is that this will  induce

developers  to  develop vacant land that does not enjoy  similar

exemption, thus adding to the supply of private housing  already

available, and this would negate the intended impact of the  new

tax measure, as the developers accelerate the development of the

vacant land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to call on the Minister to

minimise interference in the property market and be involved  in

only setting the long term directions and not to give in to  the

lobbying and the pressure from the developer groups.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, in the Government's sale of land

sites, substantial time and resources are committed by tenderers

in  their  bids  to  secure Government land.   In  an  uncertain

market,  such as what we have today, wide-ranging  bids  may  be

expected, for example, for the Marina South site.  And this is a

landmark site that involves a multi-million dollar investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the poor market sentiments, in this instance, may

invite  bidders  looking for bargain prices and those  tenderers

who  do  not wish to lose out may put up unexpectedly low  bids.

Such   low  bids  may,  in  the  already  weak  market,   be   a

destabilising force.  This will undermine the stability  of  the

property market and, of course, the economy as a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although these low bid prices may eventually be

ascertained  by  the  Chief  Valuer as  below  the  Government's

reserve  price, the detrimental effects on the market will  have

already been done.  Therefore, I am in favour of some form of  a

public  declaration of reserve prices in general land sales,  so

as  not  to affect the market adversely or wasting the  valuable

time of developers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should perhaps apply this approach for a landmark

parcel,  like  the Marina South.  In this instance,  it  may  be

better  to  have a situation where there are no bidders  because

there  is  not enough financial capacity of developers  to  bid,

rather than entertaining a small number of bidders with very low

prices.   Low  prices can shake the confidence of  the  property

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for tenderers who believe that the price should be

lower  than the reserve price, they will not have to waste  time

and  resources in the exercise.  Just as an example, the  tender

for  the  Marina South site requires each tenderer to put  in  a

tender  deposit of at least 10% of the tender sale  price.   The

market  talk  is  that  this land will be  valued  at  about  $1

billion.   10% of $1 billion or up to $1.2 billion is a  deposit

of  some  $100  million.   So  over a  three-month  period,  the

developer  will be committing something like about $100  million

of  his  funds.  Adding professional cost and interest cost  may

mean a tender bid costing something like $3 million.  Sir, these

funds will be locked up for unproductive purposes.  I would urge

the  Minister to perhaps reconsider some form of bidding whereby

reserve  prices are known so that there will not be a  situation

whereby  low  prices affect the property market.   At  the  same

time, developers will not waste time because they know that they

do  not have the financial capacity to do a project of a certain

size.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, my speech

in  the  Budget debate last year I spoke on the same issue.   At

that  time  I  pointed out three points: (1) The Government  has

committed to the long-term objective of achieving a 25%  to  30%

of   private  residential  property  to  be  private.   (2)  The

Government is the largest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>



land  owner in Singapore.  It must take a long term view in land

supply  and  gradually release sufficient land to  realise  this

objective.   The  Government's supply  of  land  should  not  be

affected  by short term fluctuations of property price.   (3)  I

pointed out that the private residential property price then was

too high and beyond the affordable level of the targeted top 30%

income  earners.   In the long term, the 30% target  of  private

residential  property could only be achieved if  the  price  was

settled at a level which was affordable to them.  At that  time,

the reply from the Minister was quite favourable, in particular,

on  the  issue of land price and, I quote, "The Government  will

not  interfere in the private housing market in as far as target

prices are concerned."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the slowdown in the residential market, the

Government in November 1997 announced that the land sale  target

for  the  rest  of 1997 would be deferred to the first  half  of

1998.   And  the 1998 figure would be pushed back to the  second

half  of  1998.  In the recent Budget Statement, it  was  stated

that  land sales for 7,000 units, ie, the combined 1997 deferred

quantity and the targeted 1998 quantity would be reduced to only

2,500  units.  From 7,000 units to 2,500 units is a  substantial

reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is the Government's

long-term  policy  in land supply.  Our private  property  price

affects the Government's land sales.  If so, will the Government

cut  back or stop the land sale from what was announced  if  the

downward  trend in property price continues, until there  is  an

upturn again?  The Government also announced a cut back in  land

allocated  for  Executive Condominiums from  the  planned  3,000

units  to  half, 1,500 units.  The reason given  in  the  Budget

Statement  is that demand has been reduced and that is  why  the

number has been reduced by half.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Executive Condominiums, though related to the private

residential  property, have its own targeted buyers.   It  is  a

sandwich  housing programme for those who cannot afford  private

condominiums but aspire to be in the list of public housing  for

Executive flats and which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>



HDB  has  ceased  taking  in new applicants.   The  Government's

commitment  to  Executive  Condominium  housing  is  to  provide

partial  subsidy  in  land cost.  The first  few  launches  were

exceptionally successful.  All units were taken up.   Thanks  to

the  Government which subsidises the Executive Condominium  when

it  was  then sold at about $410 per sq ft.  The price was  very

much  lower  and  attractive compared to an  equivalent  private

condominium  which was then sold at about $700 per  sq  ft.   As

time goes by, things change.  The price of a private condominium

has  gone all the way down, from $700 per sq ft to $500-plus per

sq  ft, and in a recent case, a project in Woodlands was selling

for  only  $410  per  sq  ft.  On the  contrary,  the  Executive

Condominium price has moved up slowly to $450 per sq ft.  It  is

no  wonder only half the number of units in the recent launch of

the Executive Condominiums were taken up.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must understand that Executive Condominium housing

is  sandwiched  in  between  the private  condominiums  and  HDB

Executive flats.  There are strings attached to the buyer and it

receives  a  Government subsidy.  The project will fail  if  the

price is too close or exceeds that of private condominiums.  The

present dilemma faced by the property developers who tender  for

Executive Condominium lands is the result of misjudgment of  the

price  trend.   We must continue to release land  for  Executive

Condominiums  in  such a way that provides  an  opportunity  for

Executive Condominium price to realign itself in relation to the

private  condominium  price and to find a comfortable  level  at

which  the  targeted sandwich group of buyers would accept.   To

hold up or reduce land sale will deprive the market from finding

its  own  price level.  Any outcome resulting from  the  current

Government measure in the Executive Condominium land price  will

be man-made and artificial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a dream of many Singaporeans to own condominiums

through the path of the Executive Condominium Scheme.  This is a

good  time  for them to enter into the market because the  price

will be right.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>



move  by the Government to cut back its supply will  not be fair

to  them.   The Government should release the land for Executive

Condominiums as previously planned and, subsequently, based on a

realistic  price  and demand, project and determine  the  future

supply.   By gauging the response for a right price but  at  the

wrong  time and arriving at the conclusion that there is a  lack

of public demand might not be a wise move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg the Minister to review this situation and

continue  to  release the land for the original 3,000  units  of

Executive Condominiums and not to cut back to only half.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chng Hee Kok is not speaking. Mr

Zulkifli.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister to refine the Executive Condominium Scheme in  view  of

the  poor demand for such properties.  Not too long ago, one  of

the  main  fears  of  young Singaporeans and  would-be  property

owners  is  that private property ownership would be beyond  the

reach  of many Singaporeans, especially professionals, graduates

and  HDB  upgraders.  The property sector also had a  number  of

imperfections.   One, the gap between prices  of  HDB  Executive

flats  and  private  property  is  so  huge  to  make  upgrading

financially  prohibitive.   What  was  needed  was  to  have   a

continuum   of   housing  options  to  serve   different   price

structures.   A  gradual  and narrower  gap  between  prices  of

different  housing types facilitate mobility and  upgrading  and

give  incentives and motivation for those who aspire to  improve

their standard of housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the EC in August 1995 meets this

objective.   When 2,000 units were brought into  the  market  in

1996  and  4,000  in 1997, the sheer size and  number  of  units

introduced  made  the EC a major factor in  the  local  property

market.   In  fact, it brought about a huge relief  to  the  so-called  "sandwich" class, the first layer of HDB  upgraders  and

first time owners who felt that they have been priced out of the

private residential market



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>



at that time.  Unfortunately, those who have been rescued by the

"sandwich"  class  by the introduction of the EC  still  remains

sandwiched today as prices of residential market have fallen  to

EC  levels.  Some developers now find themselves unable to break

even  if  ECs  are  sold  at current prices.   There  have  been

suggestions that EC should be scrapped.  With prices of  private

residential   properties  falling  buyers  will  not   find   EC

attractive, especially when it comes to restrictions not present

in private properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the contrary, I would argue that the philosophy

and  concept of EC remains relevant today as it was when it  was

first   introduced.   Yes,  the  market  may   have   made   ECs

unattractive and unsaleable today.  But what if the market takes

an  upswing?  A new sandwich class will emerge again.   The  ECs

must  remain relevant in the long run.  It is critical  that  we

have  different housing options to meet the aspirations  of  our

people  at  prices that are gradual to make upgrading  possible.

As  we all know, a flat is more than just a home.  It represents

a hope that many Singaporeans share, that they want to work hard

to buy a property, the biggest that they can possibly afford for

their  own comfort and perhaps leave something behind for future

generations.   But for EC to remain viable and relevant  in  the

future,  it must survive in the short run.  Refinements need  to

be  made  to  the  EC  in  order  to  be  responsive  to  market

conditions.   It  cannot remain rigid in  the  face  of  rapidly

changing economic scenarios.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider some of these

suggestions.   (1) remove or reduce the resale levy  imposed  on

HDB  upgraders  who  purchase ECs.  HDB upgraders  who  purchase

private property need not pay such a levy.  So why not the cases

of  EC?   (2) consider allowing CPF to be used for part  or  the

entire  portion  of the initial 20% for purchase  of  ECs.   (3)

allow preferential interest on loan for the remaining 80% of the

purchase  price, similar to that of purchases of HDB  flat.   If

need be, this can be made available for, say, a five-year period

after  which  purchasers can then obtain  loans  from  banks  at

commercial  rates.  (4) for developers, perhaps  the  Government

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>



allow developers a longer period to complete their projects  and

waive   penalties  imposed  on  developers  for   delaying   the

completion of their projects in view of the current slump in the

property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EC has been a good concept and introduced at a time

when  it  was most needed.  Market conditions, however, made  it

appear   irrelevant  and  unnecessary  today.    However,   with

refinements,  it  can  not only address and  respond  to  market

conditions  but  also  ensure that  the  objective  of  ensuring

mobility  to  meet the aspirations of our people to upgrade  and

improve themselves is still relevant and should be preserved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Upgrading of private residential estates.

The Government has spent billions of dollars so far on upgrading

the  HDB  estates,  both in the Main and the  Interim  Upgrading

Programmes.  I do not think the residents of the private housing

estates begrudge the HDB dwellers of old estates the benefit  of

this  policy  to  prevent old HDB flats from  degenerating  into

slums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is perhaps not as obvious or noticeable to the public

policy makers is that private housing estates which are very old

can  also  degenerate  into slums if no attention  is  similarly

given.  The plan to change the legislation to facilitate the  en

bloc  sales of condominiums may help to alleviate this  problem.

However,  en bloc sales would only be viable in locations  where

plot ratios have been increased significantly.  What about those

without  the  benefit  of  increased  plot  ratios?   Many   old

condominiums have problems getting enough support to embark on a

major upgrading because the residents, many of whom are old  and

retired,  cannot  afford  to contribute  tens  of  thousands  of

dollars required for a major upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he plans to

introduce  any  measure to help old private housing  estates  to

upgrade.   Could  the  Minister  consider,  for  example,   say,

subsidising 20% of the total upgrading costs of old condominiums

above  20  years old, subject to a ceiling of, say, $10,000  per

household?  This should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>



apply  only  to condominiums where en bloc sales are not  viable

because the plot ratio has not been increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the landed private residential estates, some upgrading

is  also taking place in the form of replacement of old pipes by

Singapore  Power.   As  the Minister probably  knows,  Singapore

Power  wants households affected to contribute to the laying  of

new pipes in the common properties, such as the road reserves or

drainage  reserves.  And the cost per household can come  up  to

about  $5,000 to $6,000.  If not enough households are  prepared

to  contribute,  the residents are asked to  abandon  their  old

pipes  and  convert to bottled gas.  This has upset many  landed

property residents of old estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minster is: is it not possible for the

Government to bear the cost of this infrastructural replacement?

After  all, when roads and drains are replaced, for example,  in

the  old  private housing estates, the residents are not  called

upon to shoulder the costs collectively.  Besides, residents  in

the  private housing estates believe that the then PUB had  made

enough money from gas subscribers to build up a sinking fund  to

pay for these infrastructural replacements.  I hope the Minister

can comment on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue related to upgrading here is regarding the

establishment  of  residents associations  (RAs).   In  the  HDB

estates,  we  have RCs while condominiums have their  management

corporations.   Both of these have centres or  clubhouses  where

the  residents can meet to socialise.  I believe we  should  try

the same and establish RAs in landed housing estates in order to

facilitate  and  build neighbourliness among the  people  living

there.   But to facilitate this, they need a small clubhouse  to

use for meetings and social activities.  I would like to ask the

Minister  whether he could consider setting aside some land  for

RAs to establish such a clubhouse.  This will make it easier for

RAs to be established in the landed housing estates.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government

has been  upgrading the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>



older  HDB  estates under the Main Upgrading Programme  and  the

Interim Upgrading Programme,  costing the public a lot of money.

The  Government has announced that it will also  be  doing  some

upgrading work for private estates.  But up to now, no  specific

measure   has   been  announced.   Residents  in   the   private

residential estates are anxious to know when the Government will

commence the upgrading work for them and what will be the extent

of the upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some private residential estates were built many years

ago.   The  roads  are very narrow and parking spaces  are  very

limited.   Right  now,  some families in  the  private  estates,

particularly  the  middle-aged couples, have  grown-up  children

living  together with them, and they own more than one car.   In

most  cases,  there is only parking space for one   car  in  the

compound  of  the house. The other cars will have to  be  parked

outside, along the roadside.  For the rather narrow roads within

the residential estate, the roads become even  narrower with the

cars  being parked along the roadside, and it is very  difficult

for  vehicles  to move around.  The neighbours may  complain  as

they  are inconvenienced, not just occasionally but day  in  and

day out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, in the private residential estates, there

is  usually  very  little open space or public  garden  for  the

residents  to enjoy themselves during their leisure hours.   The

Ministry  of National Development should consider helping  these

private   residential   estates  in   improving   their   living

environment.   For example, the Government can buy  over  a  few

adjoining houses in a highly congested estate, demolish them and

build  a  small  garden  there or  a  small  car  park  for  the

convenience  of the residents to park their cars  and  to  enjoy

their leisure.  Apart from that, there may be other improvements

and upgrading works, such as widening the roads, resurfacing the

roads  or  to  convert the overhanging cables  into  underground

cables and to alter the gradients of the drains to prevent water

stagnation.  All these measures can further improve  the living



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>



environment  of private residential estates.  I  hope  that  the

Minister  for  National  Development can seriously  consider  my

suggestions.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Sir,  this  is supposed to be an austerity year.  I am surprised

to hear such a long wish list from Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address the key issue raised by several

Members,  ie, what is Government's role in the private  property

market.   Mr  Lew  Syn Pau stressed that the  Government  should

strive for stability in the property market.  Mr Inderjit  Singh

asked  that the Government not intervene in the market  and  let

the  free  market settle the private property prices.    Earlier

on, during the debate on the Budget, several Members such as  Mr

Inderjit  Singh, Mr Simon Tay and Mr Chuang felt that there  had

been  too much Government intervention and support given to  the

property sector and property developers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate what the

Government's role in the private property market is.  First, can

the Government adopt a completely hands-off approach and let the

free market reign in the private property market?  The answer is

no.   The  property  market is closely  linked  to  the  overall

economy  and the stability of the financial system.   More  than

90%  of  Singaporeans  own  their  homes.   No  government  can,

therefore,  take a completely hands-off approach to the  private

property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the private property market will go

through the business cycles.  Prices will go up and prices  will

come  down.  The Government has no intention of fixing  property

price levels, nor can it do so.   The Government does not have a

target  price  level  to reach.  However,  the  Government  will

intervene in the property market when it is necessary to prevent

excessive  swings  in  the market.  This  is  because  a  severe

overheating of the property market or a crash will have  serious

ramifications on the real economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why the Government cannot take a completely

hands-off approach is because the Government itself is  involved

in  land  sales.   At  the end of the day, the  Government  must

decide  how  much land to sell, and that will affect the  supply

side of the equation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Government's role in the property market?

First,  the  Government  will monitor the  property  market  and

dampen  excessive  volatility that  can  undermine  the  overall

financial  and economic stability of the country.   Second,  the

Government   will   always  ensure  that  property   loans   for

development and for mortgages are within prudent limits.  Third,

the  Government will release sufficient land to meet the  medium

term   demand.    Finally,  the  Government  encourages   market

transparency  by making clear Government's land  sale  programme

ahead of time and providing timely and comprehensive information

on  property stocks, occupancy and potential supply.  At the end

of  the day, market forces will settle the price levels, not the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which was raised by the MPs is that the

Government  appeared to be passive when the property market  was

rising  a few years ago, and now seem to be actively intervening

when  the  market is declining.  Let me set the record straight.

When  the  market went up sharply in 1993 and 1994, it reflected

the very strong double digit economic growth then.  Furthermore,

the  region  was booming.  Foreign funds flowed into the  region

and into Singapore.  As we all know, the region is now suffering

from the excesses of that period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1987, the Government planned on the basis that

public  housing will constitute 90% of homes in  Singapore.   We

realise that this did not reflect the rising incomes and  rising

expectations  of  Singaporeans.  So  in  1990,  we  announced  a

systematic  Government  land  sales  programme  to  inject  more

private  housing  units into the market.  We  started  off  with

1,500  units in 1990, rising gradually to 3,000 units  in  1993.

When  prices  started  to rise sharply in 1993,  the  Government

stepped up its annual land sales from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>



3,000  units in 1993 to 4,000 units in 1994, and then  to  6,000

units in 1995, to meet the increased demand for private housing.

So  it  is  not possible for the Government to set a fixed  land

sales and expect to operate as an auto pilot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Prof. Low Seow Chay himself argued for more land

sales  when the property prices were going up.  Many MPs did  so

in  1993 and 1994.  So it is not possible when prices are coming

down  to  say that Government stay clear and do nothing at  all.

Similarly,  the Government introduced Executive Condominiums  in

1995  to make private housing more affordable to a certain group

of people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the private property market stabilised for the first

nine  months  in  1995, we thought we had  solved  the  problem.

However,  the property market started to overheat again  at  the

end  of  1995  and in early 1996.  The Government  then  had  to

introduce the anti-speculation measures in May 1996.   This  was

necessary  to  curb   market excesses and prevent  the  property

bubble  from  further ballooning, as this would  have  made  the

subsequent market correction even more drastic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I explained the history is to show that the

Government anticipated the strong demand for private housing, as

early  as  1989.  If the Government did not inject more  private

housing  into  the  market  through the  Government  land  sales

programme,  prices would have gone up much higher in  the  early

1990s.  Again, if the Government did not intervene in May  1996,

the  property  market would also have risen much  higher  and  a

subsequent correction more painful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the markets do go up, people get caught up in it,

and think that prices would not fall.  We can call it exuberance

or  we  can call it euphoria.  Similarly, when markets  do  come

down,  there is gloom and doom.  People stay away.   The  market

declines further and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.   It

is not possible to prevent such cycles.  The Government can only

take limited action to moderate the excesses of such cycles.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the middle of last year, the economic landscape has

changed  substantially.    There is  now  an  excess  supply  of

properties  and  a  contraction of demand due  to  uncertainties

arising  from the regional economic turmoil.  Under the  present

circumstances,  it  will not be prudent for  the  Government  to

continue  with  the  land sales at the same  level  as  previous

years.  This is because releasing more land than the market  can

absorb  will  exacerbate  the downward  swing  of  the  property

market.  The Government has thus decided to suspend the sales of

sites  for 2,500 residential units to the second half  of  1998.

However,  let  me  assure the House that the Government  remains

committed to releasing sufficient land over the medium  term  to

meet   Singaporeans'  aspirations  to  own  private  residential

properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether we have enough units in

the medium term.  As Members have noticed, in the fourth quarter

1997  land  supply  data, we have more than 40,000  units  under

construction, of which more than half are still not sold.  8,000

units,   started  construction,  have  all  the  building   plan

approvals,  launched for sale and not sold.  Another  8,600-over

units  started  construction, not yet launched  for  sale,  also

unsold.   So  you  have  more than 17,000 units  in  the  market

unsold,  ready  for  takers.  The Government  will  continue  to

monitor the economic and property situation carefully, and  will

sell more units when the market recovers

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked the Government not to lift the May

1996  anti-speculation  measures.   I  agree  with  him.   These

measures  will serve us well, both in the upturn as well  as  in

the  downturn.  The Government, therefore, has no plans to  lift

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh was also concerned that the tax exemption

for  land  under  development  and  not  for  vacant  land  will

accelerate  the development and thus add to the housing  supply.

I do not think developers would start development and add to the

oversupply situation simply because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>



the property tax allows them to do so.  Developers will add   to

the  supply only if they think there is a demand and  that  they

can  sell  the  units  for  a profit.  Therefore,  property  tax

exemption  for  land under development will not  exacerbate  the

land supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked whether Government should lower the

upfront  cash payment for housing purchase from 20% to  10%,  to

help  young  first-timers  to  own  private  property.   I  must

reiterate what Dr Richard Hu said, ie, that "Singaporeans should

only  purchase private property only if they can afford it.   It

is  not  advisable  for banks to lend or for  buyers  to  borrow

beyond what is financially prudent for them, especially at  this

time  of  economic  uncertainty."  The 80%  financial  limit  on

mortgage loans in Singapore is still higher compared to  70%  in

Hong  Kong.   If young Singaporeans cannot afford the  20%  cash

outlay, then they should start off with the HDB flat and upgrade

to   private   property  when  they  can   better   afford   it.

Alternatively,  they  can apply for the  Executive  Condominiums

where they will be given a $40,000 CPF housing grant if they are

first-time purchasers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok asked whether the Government will set

reserve prices for land tenders.  I have discussed this with the

Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Law, and they are not in

favour of stipulating reserve prices for the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fairly long time lag between the launch of a

sale  and the closing of the tender.  For example, for the  site

that  Mr Chng mentioned, the Marina South site, there is a five-month  time  lag.   So if the Chief Valuer were  to  announce  a

reserve  price in November last year and we close  in  May  this

year,  I  think his reserve price will be very much out of  sync

with  the market.  Similarly, it is not the market practice  for

private land owners to disclose their reserve prices.  So  I  do

not see why the Government should have a practice different from

the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Mr Chng's comments about the results of the Marina

South tender, I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>



not  want to pre-judge the results.  I agree with him that there

is  a  certain upfront cost in preparing for the tender.  I will

get  URA to examine how to minimise this cost, because it  is  a

large site and we need not tie up a large deposit unnecessarily.

In  any  case, it is not that the developers are tying  up  $100

million.  This takes the form of a banker's guarantee and so  it

is not tying up capital unnecessarily.  We will examine it.  For

large  sites, perhaps we need not have such a big  amount  as  a

deposit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Executive Condominiums. Let me

reiterate the objective of the Executive Condominiums.  As  many

Members have highlighted, it is to satisfy those who want to buy

something more than a HDB flat but yet cannot afford the private

property.   We can either call it a "sandwich housing",  we  can

call it a hybrid between HDB and private housing.  The intention

is  that since HDB now builds and sells 5-room and 4-room flats,

we think that there is a group of Singaporeans who aspire to own

more than HDB flats but cannot quite cross into private housing.

That  is why we introduced the Executive Condominiums.  We think

this concept remains valid in good times or bad, but we have  to

be  realistic.  If private property prices increase,  then  less

people  will be able to afford private property and  the  demand

for Executive Condominiums will go up.  Similarly or conversely,

if  private property prices decrease, then more people would  be

able to afford private property and therefore the demand for ECs

will  drop.  So it is not possible for us to set a fixed  supply

of ECs and not adjust according to the market conditions.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our estimates of what this group of people would

be, we think that out of 25,000 new households per year, between

5%   and  10%  would  be  the  target  group  to  own  Executive

Condominiums.  And therefore between 1,500 and 2,500 units every

year  will be the right number to sell.  We started off in  1996

with 2,000 units because of the sharp prices.  We increased  the

number to 4,000 in 1997.  We have therefore decided to cut  back

in 1998 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>



1,500  units.  As you can see, if you average this out, this  is

more  or  less  the  number that we expect to  be  able  to  buy

Executive Condominiums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the Executive Condominiums has to settle

between  the  HDB prices and the private property prices.   What

the  price would be will have to be determined by the market and

the developers who are building these properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to upgrading of private housing estates. I

take  all the comments of various Members.  Let me just explain.

First,  the  Government  has the intention  to  upgrade  private

housing  estates.   We have said this before and  we  are  still

committed to upgrading private housing estates.  Second, what is

the  scope of this upgrading?  I am a little taken aback by  all

these suggestions about clubhouses.  I think we want to make  it

quite clear that upgrading of private housing estates, as we see

it  today,  will only take place in the public areas.   It  will

take the scope something like the Interim Upgrading Programme of

the  HDB for the public areas.  We are not likely to enter  into

the  common property of the condominiums, neither are we  likely

to  enter into the compound of the landed property.  So I  think

the  scope is limited to the public areas.  The budget  will  be

more or less like the IUP budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question will be when do we implement the project.

We  have  hoped to implement it this year.  But because  of  the

economic  downturn, we have to postpone it.   It  will  be  very

difficult for me to explain how we can cut back on MUP  and  IUP

on  one  hand  and start off another programme  on  the  private

housing  estates  on  the other.  So I think  it  will  be  more

prudent for us to launch this project when the economy recovers.

At  that point, we can reinstate the MUP and IUP programmes  and

at  the  same time launch the programme for the private  housing

estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Mr Lew Syn Pau's specific examples of laying of gas

pipes,  I think we are familiar with that issue.  The bottomline

is: do you implement an upgrading programme when it is not cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>



effective, when the alternative of using bottled gas is so  much

more  cost effective?  Do you need to re-lay pipes for town  gas

when  each household could just make use of bottled gas?  So  it

is  not  just  a  question of upgrading but  also  the  economic

usefulness of expending that sum of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the establishment of RAs, I think we are supportive but

not at the price of having to build a clubhouse for every one of

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered most of the questions. Please

point out any other issues which I have not covered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, the upgrading of HDB estates has been

well received by most HDB residents, even though it involves  an

element  of  cost  sharing.  The only negative feedback  I  have

received is that the contractors for the works tend to take  too

long and hence inconvenience residents for an unduly long period

of time of between two and three years, because they work on too

many  blocks  (about  10 to 15 blocks) at  the  same  time.   My

question to the Minister is: would it not be possible to get the

contractors  to work on a fewer number of blocks  at  one  time,

say, three to five blocks, so that they can shorten the duration

of  the upgrading works to just one to two years, instead of two

to three years?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on upgrading of 1- and 2-room flats. The HDB's upgrading programme has been a success.

Older  flats  were rejuvenated to improve the living environment

of   those   who  have  supported  the  Government's   upgrading

programme.  But due to the criteria for selection, many  of  the

flats  upgraded  are 3-room flats.  Not much has  been  done  to

upgrade 1- and 2-room flats in the HDB estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, there are about 3,200 units of 1- and 2-room

flats  in Singapore.  Most of these flats are rented out to  low

income  families, including older Singaporeans.  Many  of  these

flats  were  built  in  the 70s and 80s and  do  not  have  many

facilities, especially for the senior citizens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I lived in a 1-room flat for six years. I understand

the  plight  of  these  residents.  I  understand  their  living

conditions.    I   am   sure  Singaporeans  will   support   any

Government's  effort to improve the living conditions  of  these

fellow Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would strongly urge the Ministry to consider

implementing upgrading programmes for 1- and 2-room  HDB  flats.

As  these are mainly rented flats, HDB should bear the full cost

of  upgrading,  thus alleviating any financial burden  on  these

residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, upgrading of HDB flats, in

particular  IUP.  The present grant given to IUP is  $6,000  per

household and if lift upgrading is included, the grant is $7,000

per household.  I have the experience of managing two IUPs in my

precinct  in  the Moulmein ward in the last few years.   And  my

conclusion  is  that  the  budget of  $7,000  per  household  is

actually  very, very tight for lift upgrading.  This is because,

firstly,  slab  blocks require two to three lifts  per  upgraded

block  and lift upgrading is a very expensive project  but  very

essential  for residents, especially older residents.  Secondly,

as a result of costly lift upgrading, there is very little money

left  for  other block works and precinct upgrading, some  basic

facilities  for children and other residents.  And even  if  one

spends  very  little amount on these fancy horticultural  works,

there is still not enough for precinct upgrading facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two questions:

First,  whether he can consider increasing the funding  for  the

IUPs that embark on lift upgrading and, if that is not possible,

as  he  said  last  year, can he consider lift  upgrading  as  a

separate  programme, like IUP and MUP?  This question  was  also

being  asked  last  year.  The second question  really  is  that

whether  blocks which are four or five storeys can be considered

for  lift  programme, as Mr Ang Mong Seng had  brought  up  last

year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I welcome the

announcement  that  the  number  of  precincts,  which  will  be

selected  this year for Main Upgrading, has been reduced.   Some

people have questioned whether the Government is going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>



back  on  its promise on upgrading.  But I believe the  downward

adjustment in the MUP schedule is prudent when we consider  this

issue  from  the perspective of flat owners who are  or  may  be

affected by the on-going economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Main Upgrading Programme has

proven  to  be  very popular with HDB flat owners and  they  had

happily voted in favour of the upgrading and shared the cost  of

upgrading during better times.  Under the cost-sharing  formula,

depending  on  the  room-type and the  upgrading  package,  flat

owners  have to pay between 7% and 42% of the cost of upgrading.

For  the Basic Package, a 1-, 2- or 3-room flat owner would have

to  contribute  $2,200  for  the  cost  of  upgrading.   For  an

Executive flat owner under the Standard-Plus Package, the amount

payable is $28,500.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this monetary outlay can prove to be a great

burden,  especially at a difficult time like  this.   We  should

therefore  also  consider  whether,  in  this  present  economic

climate,  it is fair or reasonable to expect the HDB flat  owner

to  spend that kind of money on the upgrading and beautification

of  this  precinct and his flat.  Or, would the  flat  owner  be

better  off investing the money in things which will  bring  him

long  term benefits and returns?  For example, with $2,200 which

the  1-,  2-  or  3-room flat owner has to  pay  for  the  Basic

Package,  he  could buy a Pentium multimedia  computer  for  his

child.   And,  in the case of the Executive flat owner  for  the

Standard-Plus  Package, with $28,500, he  could  see  his  child

through four years of tertiary education in our NUS or NTU.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has announced that with slower economic

growth, the MUP has been adjusted downwards this year.  However,

this  does  not  mean  that residents have  lost  out  on  their

upgrading forever.  The Minister for Finance has assured us that

the pace of the programme is dependent on the size of the budget

surplus.   Therefore, when the economy recovers in  due  course,

perhaps  in  the  year 2000 or 2001, and we have  larger  budget

surpluses  at that time, the number of upgrading precincts  will

correspondingly increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, urge those who question the Government's

decision  to slow down the pace of the Main Upgrading  Programme

at this time to consider whether it is prudent and wiser, in the

light of the present uncertainty and economic climate, for  flat

owners  to  direct  their  resources to  other  more  productive

investments  and uses.  After all, one of the main  reasons  why

Thailand  ran into financial difficulties was that  it  borrowed

and spent too much on non-productive property developments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam See Tong is not here. Mr Zainul.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I agree with Mr Ong that in

these  days  of  austerity  the  rescheduling  of  the  MUP   is

understandable.   But I must say that when Government  announced

that  the MUP schedule will be slowed down to 10 precincts, many

were disappointed.  I think my GRC chief, Mr Lee Yock Suan, will

know  that.   Even  my residents in Punggol  East  were  looking

forward  to their own IUP and MUP.  They were hoping that  their

turn  could  come sooner than later.  As we know, originally  15

precincts were scheduled a year from 1996 to the year 2000.  But

I am sure many will also understand, pending improvements in the

economic outlook of the region, they will have to live with this

new situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the expectations raised earlier, I

wonder, Sir, whether the Minister would continue to monitor  the

economic situation closely and review the MUP schedule  as  soon

as  possible.   In  addition to the question of surpluses,  what

other  criteria  would be used, whether, in fact,  the  economic

growth rates and developments in the region would also be  taken

into consideration to determine the scale of the review.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on lift upgrading. In

land-scarce  Singapore,  the majority of  Singaporeans  have  no

choice but to live in high-rise flats.  As we move into the next

millennium, Singaporeans are more likely to be living in 30-  or

40-storey  flats.  Living in high-rise buildings  can  be  quite

comfortable  provided we have a reliable and safe  lift  system.

If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>



lifts fail frequently, many residents will be inconvenienced and

some  may  be trapped in the lifts.  Thus, it is important  that

lifts  are  maintained,  upgraded and  replaced  accordingly  to

ensure that they function properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the HDB, the recommended replacement cycle of

a lift is 28 years.  However, in practice, most lifts will begin

to  give problems after 15 years of operation.  The average lift

breakdown  rate for HDB flats is 0.3 per lift per  month.   This

means  that  3% of HDB lifts (that is about 3,000  lifts)  break

down  monthly.  This is definitely not acceptable if we were  to

live  in 30-storey buildings.  In the Interim and Main Upgrading

Programmes, lift upgrading is not a standard item of  work.   As

such, some IUP and MUP did not upgrade or replace the lifts  due

to  budget constraint.  It costs about $95,000 to replace a lift

for  a  12-storey  block  with three lift  landings,  while  the

replacement  of  a lift for a 12-storey block with  12  landings

will cost approximately $175,000.



<br>6.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I hope the Government will consider increasing the

grant  for  both  IUP  and  MUP programmes.   In  addition,  the

Ministry  must  specify  lift  upgrading  or  replacement  as  a

standard item of work for all IUP and MUP.  Where possible,  all

upgraded blocks must have lift landing at every floor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the private residential flats, there is presently no

provision  in  the  Land  Titles (Strata)  Act  stipulating  the

percentage of contribution for sinking fund.  As a result,  some

management  corporations, especially the older condominiums,  do

not  make adequate provision for the replacement of their lifts.

The   replacement  of  lifts  is  a  costly  exercise  and  some

management corporations encounter difficulty in raising funds to

carry out such works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Government to consider

providing  a  grant  or  tax incentive  for  owners  of  private

residential flats to upgrade their lifts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, since the last economic downturn in

1985,  Singaporeans have enjoyed more than a decade of  economic

growth.   This has formed the basis on which many families  plan

financially  for their future.  Therefore, it is  understandable

how the present economic downturn has taken many Singaporeans by

surprise  and upset their financial planning.  This is  probably

nowhere  more obvious than in financial plans for one  necessity

close to everyone's heart, and that is housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consistent economic growth over the past decade has led

many  a  Singaporean  to project their ability  to  finance  the

purchase of a home on the basis of assumptions, such as,  first,

a  stable  income.  Until recently, most Singaporeans  can  look

forward  to good annual salary increments year after year  in  a

competitive  job  market.  Second, the  rising  property  market

where  an  investment  in property will almost  certainly  yield

profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder that many applicants for new HDB flats opt

for  the bigger room types.  As at 31st January 1998, 57% of the

131,100 applicants on the HDB waiting list have opted to buy a 5-room  flat.   In 1997, 59% of the new applicants for 4-room  and

bigger  flats have opted for 5-room flats, compared  to  36%  in

1991.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the light of the present economic crisis, these

assumptions are not reliable.  Family income might not  increase

as  projected but could even decline because of retrenchment and

lower bonuses and increments.  HDB flats on the resale market no

longer command the same premium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore urge the HDB to consider the

difficulties  faced by the following three broad  categories  of

HDB  lessees.  The first group are new applicants who are in the

queue for flats which are now beyond their means.  Could the HDB

allow and facilitate this group of applicants to opt for smaller

flats  instead?  If such applicants have to go ahead to complete

their  purchase, they would probably face increasing  difficulty

in  fulfilling their repayment obligations under their  mortgage

loan financing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it would be most helpful at times like these that

such  applicants,  who have miscalculated their  future  earning

capability,  be  permitted to select  smaller  flats  and  hence

lessen their financial burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group are those who have upgraded in the last

two  and  a  half years by buying a larger flat  in  the  resale

market  and  are  now realising that they could  not  afford  to

maintain such a big flat.  Under existing HDB rules, they cannot

dispose  the flat within two-and-a-half years of purchasing  it.

For  such  families  who  are  compelled  by  circumstances   to

downgrade,  could the Minister consider relaxing this  rule  and

permit  them to sell their flats in the open market in order  to

purchase a smaller one again from the open market?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group are existing flat owners who, because of a

change  in  their  financial circumstances arising  out  of  the

current  economic crisis, are not facing difficulties in meeting

the  obligations  under  the mortgage  loan  repayments.   Under

section 56(1)(k) of the Housing and Development Act, the HDB has

the  power  to compulsorily acquire the flat on the ground  that

the lessee is owing the HDB arrears of monthly instalments.  The

HDB has served section 56 Notices in the past for debts as small

as a few thousand dollars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a good year like 1996, of the 407,200 households with

mortgage loan account, four defaulted on their payments and  had

their  flats repossessed by the HDB.  Given the present economic

circumstances,  we can expect this number to increase.   In  the

fourth  quarter  of 1997 alone, 4,278 workers  lost  their  jobs

because of retrenchment.  More workers are likely to be laid off

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be easy for these retrenched workers,

especially  those  who  are  sole breadwinners  of  large  young

families, to face the prospect of losing the family's roof  over

their  heads  because they have difficulties  meeting  the  loan

repayment schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme of things in Singapore, owning a HDB flat

is a heavily protected right.  Commercial creditors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



who  may  be  owed  large  sums of money,  may  institute  legal

proceedings  to enforce their claims and make the HDB  lessee  a

bankrupt, but they cannot take over his flat, they cannot  throw

him out into the streets and take away the roof over his head.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be most ironical for the HDB, whose

mission is to provide Singaporeans with affordable new HDB flats

under  the  Home  Ownership Scheme,  to  evict  the  debtor  and

compulsorily  repossess his flat to enforce  a  debt  of  a  few

thousand dollars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to take this opportunity to

reassure HDB lessees that in difficult times, such as these, the

HDB  would  not  evict  them  but would  view  with  sympathetic

understanding and grant extension of time for repayment to  help

these  affected families tide over their financial  difficulties

arising from this economic crisis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan is not here. Mr Zainul.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, many policies have been

introduced by the HDB since 1992 that have pushed up  prices  of

HDB  flats.  Just now, we heard from the Minister the  milestone

policy that was brought about since the 1990s.  Whether it is  a

market valuation system adopted for mortgage loan financing, the

MUP, SERS, the CPF Housing Grant, I think they all contribute to

higher prices of HDB flats.  However, the introduction of ECs in

July  1996  helped  to  moderate prices.  Similarly,  there  was

further  moderation when the Government announced in April  1997

the revised mortgage financing policy and the revised allocation

of flats policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister how effective are these last two

measures in curbing speculative demand for HDB flats and do they

make  HDB  flats more affordable for the public?  How would  the

Minister  measure that?  I also like to ask what measures  would

the  Minister  introduce  to  make HDB  flats  more  affordable,

especially for the lower income group.  What percentage  of  the

lower  income  group own their own flats and how would  he  make

more of them home owners?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on 19th February

this  year  in  Parliament, I asked the  Minister  for  National

Development  a  few  questions relating to the  sale  price  and

subsidy  of   HDB  flats.   In his written  answer,  the  latest

figures for the fourth quarter of 1997 and the first quarter  of

1998  show that after deducting the construction cost  and  land

cost,  there is a lot of profit to be made from the sale of  the

Sengkang flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Contract N2C27, there are 795 units. From each unit,

the Government makes a profit of $39,221.  After the sale of all

the flats, the total profit may exceed $31 million.  In Contract

N3C1, there are 442 units.  The Government's profit on each unit

is  $29,000, and after selling all the units,  the total  profit

may  exceed   $12 million.   In Contract N2C28,  there  are  444

units and the profit on each unit is $1,016.   After the sale of

all the flats, the total profit will amount to $451,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after selling all these flats in the Sengkang area, the

Government can make a profit of  more than $44 million.  I would

like to ask whether the Government is  subsidizing the flats  in

Sengkang or making a profit from there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the number of

applications received as at January 1998 for HDB flats stands at

47,218  applications for 5-room flats, 39,369 for  4-room  flats

and  2,635  for 3-room flats.  And in Punggol 21, the queue  for

the  period ending 31st January 1998, the number of applications

for  5-room  flats  is 20,300, whereas for 4-room  flats  it  is

12,900.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proportionately high 5-room applicants do not quite

correspond with the demographic nor the economic profile of  the

applicants.  The high number of 5-room flat applications may not

be  a  true reflection of the demand or special requirements  of

the  applicants  nor  necessarily coincides  with  the  economic

ability  to  purchase the flat.  Many apply for the 5-room  flat

thinking  that there is an advantage to apply for a larger  flat

now  instead of upgrading at a later date when the need  arises.

That  is  why  there  is  such a high percentage  of  first-time

applications for this type of flat which means that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>



first,  they not only have to bear a higher purchasing cost  but

also  higher  maintenance  cost,  other  utility  and  upkeeping

expenses.   Worse,  in  times of economic downturn,  they  would

definitely feel the economic strain in acquiring the extra space

that  they do not need, as my colleague, Mr Ong Kian Min, stated

that many have already asked to be downgraded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, from the national point of view, it would be a

tremendous waste of resources because the built-up areas are not

being  used  to  the maximum.  Already in Singapore,  the  ratio

between  the  built-up area and each occupant in  a  residential

unit  is one of the highest in Asia.  I would therefore like  to

ask  the  Minister  in  what way the  Ministry  can  advise  the

applicants  to be more realistic in choosing the  type  of  flat

they  want to apply so that they are more comfortable both  with

the   need  and  the  financial  affordability.   Perhaps   some

guidelines  can  be introduced requesting applicants  of  larger

flats  to  have a minimum number of occupants or set  a  minimum

combined  family  income for those who want to  apply  for  such

larger flats.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in Singapore, 90% of

our  population  live in HDB flats.  Every eligible  family  can

apply  direct  for a flat from the HDB twice in their  lifetime.

In  other  words,  they  can get the subsidies  twice  from  the

Government.   But  single  persons  in  Singapore  cannot  apply

directly  for flats from the HDB.  They have to wait until  they

are  35 years old before they can buy resale flats from the open

market. Otherwise, they will have to team up with a person above

35 years of age to apply for a new HDB flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that the objective of the policy is to

encourage  young  people to get married,  and  start  their  own

families.   But sometimes, marriage can be a matter of  destiny.

To  a girl, once the tender age is past, it may not be easy  for
