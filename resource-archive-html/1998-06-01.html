what  is  the  latest assessment on the adverse  impact  of  the

worsening economic and political situation in Indonesia and  the

prolonged  adverse economic conditions of Japan and other  Asian

countries  on the Singapore economy; (b) whether the possibility

of a sudden economic downturn or recession is much more imminent

now;  and (c) whether there is now an urgency to respond to  the

worsening  regional  economic  crisis  with  various  off-Budget

measures such as the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>

lowering  of  Government taxes and charges and the provision  of

stimulus  in the form of substantial increases in infrastructure

expenditure.



<div align="center"><h4>OFF-BUDGET MEASURES</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Introduction)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether it is now time to introduce more off-Budget measures, in

anticipation of the probable consequences of the economic crisis

in Indonesia and its effect on Singapore's economy.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Finance,

with further economic slowdown, what off-Budget measures will be

implemented by the Government to boost the economy.



<div align="center"><b>REGIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to minimise possible fallout)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b> asked the Minister for

Finance,  in  facing  the  regional  economic  crisis  and   the

recession  predicted  in Japan, what are  Singapore's  immediate

concerns  and what measures the Government will take to minimise

their possible fallout.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Questions 1  to

6 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Tay Beng Chuan

and  Dr  Lee Tsao Yuan have asked about the impact of the recent

developments in Indonesia on the Singapore economy.  Mr Tay  and

Mr Zainul Abidin also wanted to know how the economic conditions

of  Japan and other Asian countries would affect Singapore.  The

effects  of the financial turmoil and developments in  Indonesia

have  yet to be fully played out.  The current outlook  for  the

external  environment is therefore mixed.  While the US  and  EU

economic  growth remains healthy, the Asian economies have  come

under severe downward pressure.  In Japan, there are signs of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>

substantial  slowdown but it will be ameliorated to some  extent

by their recent fiscal stimulus package.  The economic situation

in Thailand and South Korea appears to have stabilised somewhat.

But developments in Indonesia have increased volatility over the

short-term.  The overall picture is still one of uncertainty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee has also asked about the specific impact of the

financial  turmoil on the economic forecast.  MTI's  GDP  growth

forecast  of  2.5-4.5%  for 1998 has factored  in  the  regional

financial turmoil, and its impact on the growth prospects of our

neighbouring  countries.   But  as developments,  especially  in

Indonesia,  have yet to stabilise, nobody can be  certain  about

the  full impact of the financial crisis on our economy at  this

point in time.  However, as the Singapore economy is fairly well

diversified, we are unlikely to slip into negative  growth  this

year  as  growth  will  be supported by the  relatively  healthy

performance in the US and EU economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay, Dr Lee, Mr Chng Hee Kok, Mr Zainul Abidin and Mrs

Yu-Foo Yee Shoon have all asked about the implementation of off-Budget  measures.  As I have mentioned during the Budget debate,

the  Government  will  implement further  measures  if  economic

growth  slows down significantly.  The Government is  monitoring

the  economy  very  closely.   In the  first  quarter  of  1998,

economic  growth  has  slowed to 5.6%.   Growth  in  the  second

quarter  is  expected to moderate further  as  impact  from  the

regional financial turmoil filters through the economy.  Non-oil

domestic  exports  have declined by 1.6% in April.   Preliminary

data  showed  it continued to drop by 6% in May.  We  will  soon

know how sharply the second quarter GDP growth has declined.  We

will  then decide if we should proceed with additional  measures

to help the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Minister for

Finance,  in  his  answer, said that the  Government  will  only

consider  implementing off-Budget measures if the economy  slows

down  significantly.  May I know from the Minister what does  he

mean  by  "significant slowdown"?  What percentage is he looking

at?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> A "significant slowdown" would mean

that it would be down to negative growth, for example.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is it for one quarter?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The standard definition of a

recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister when will the second quarter results be known since the

Minister  did say that off-Budget measures will be decided  only

when the second quarter results are known?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We will not know the full second

quarter results until some time in July, but we do not expect to

have  to  wait quite that long.  I think by the middle  of  this

month or towards the latter part of the month, we will know  the

full May results and that might give us sufficient indication of

the  forward trend.  The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister  for

Defence,  Dr  Tony  Tan,  already indicated  that  we  might  do

something before the full second quarter results are known.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask the Minister whether the number of those retrenched would

be considered as one of the significant factors before more off-Budget measures will be introduced?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes, of course, that would be a

significant indication.  In fact, that reflects the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, will the Minister

explain  what  is  the  time frame by  which  measures  will  be

effective the moment they are implemented?  In other words,  how

long   will  all  these  measures  that  he  has  in  mind,   if

implemented, take effect?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It depends on the nature of the

measures.   A  rebate, for example, will take place immediately.

Infrastructure  spending will take some time to filter  through,

again,  depending on the type of spending which takes place.   A

tax  cut  will not take place until next year.  So  there  is  a

whole package of measures

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>

we  can  consider,  some  of which are  going  to  be  effective

immediately, and some are medium and longer term.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Taking into account the period when

historical data is known and the measures which the Minister has

taken  into  account  in his basket of measures  which  he  will

implement when the economy slows down significantly, there  will

be a certain period of time for measures to take effect.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not quite sure what he means.

But if we do something, for example - I am not promising this  - towards  the end of June or July, as I mentioned, if we announce

the  rebates  they would take place immediately other  than  the

time  for processing.  As for the other measures, it depends  on

the  nature of the actual cuts and the programmes.  So I  cannot

give  him  a precise figure.  But I am sure the Member  realises

that  we went through this experience in 1985/86 and it did  not

take us very long to recover although the circumstances, I would

admit, between now and 1985/86 are completely different.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, with regard to the impact of the

recent turmoil in Indonesia, surely the Minister will agree that

that  impact  would be negative in terms of the  impact  on  the

Singapore  economy.  To the extent that the growth  forecast  of

2.5-4.5%  was  made earlier on this year and  the  situation  in

Indonesia  has since deteriorated, surely that would  mean  that

the growth forecast for Singapore, even if it remains within 2.5-4.5%, would actually hover around the lower end of the range  or

that the forecast range would be lower than 2.5-4.5%.  Would the

Minister agree?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I cannot disagree with her

arguments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, since we have already got

indications that the number of those to be retrenched  would  be

more  than the number retrenched in 1985 when we had very strong

measures  introduced, would it not be better  to  introduce  the

measures  now  rather than wait for the second  quarter  results

where we may end up with a position of too little, too late?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> These are all estimates of what the

retrenchments might be.  I am not certain that in fact  it  will

actually turn out to be more than in 1985/86.  I think the  most

important thing to remember is that we should not over-react  to

monthly  changes in statistics.  We have to ensure that whatever

measures we take are consistent with sound principles.  The last

thing  we  want to do is for the Government to micro-manage  the

economy, ie, when you see one sector falling, suddenly you  have

to  apply  measures to correct the whole economy.  We will  take

whatever  measure is necessary and I am not suggesting  that  we

should  wait  months  or  years for something  to  happen.   All

indications are that it will be sooner than later.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I want to ask

the  Minister  about the growth forecast of  2.5-4.5%.   We  are

looking at the weak regional growth now.  Malaysia has announced

a  negative  growth, so did Hong Kong.  Thailand  and  Indonesia

would not be much better.  On that basis, how can we expect  the

Singapore  economy to be on a positive note?   If so,  would  he

now implement the measures sooner than later?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Even if it should turn out to be

at  the  lower  end of our range, that is not a  recession.   By

international standards, 2.5-3% is excellent performance.  It is

only  when  you look against the whole background of Singapore's

growth  of  7-8% in the past few years that you think  it  is  a

disaster.  In fact, without the exceptional circumstances of the

last  few years, 7-8%, in Singapore's state of present  GDP,  is

unsustainable.   We  have said this many times.   In  fact,  our

medium term forecast for non-inflationary growth is 4-6%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, if you consider the business

sector, it has actually gone into negative growth this year.  If

that is the case, would the Ministry look into some measures  to

be introduced as quickly as possible?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Which negative growth are you

talking about?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> GDP growth.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> No, we will not wait for GDP growth

to  go negative before we do something.  If the trend is clearly

going  to  head in that direction, we will try to do  something.

This is what we have assured the House.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, in short, why are we not

responding quickly?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I have just tried to explain why.

We  would  like  to  look at the May figures  before  we  react.

Surely, it is not too long to wait for a few weeks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister two questions? They

are  not  related.  First of all, the question of  US$5  billion

loan to Indonesia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, your question is not related to

the  Question on the Order Paper.  I will not allow you  to  ask

that  question.  Could you ask questions related to the Question

under discussion?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought we were

discussing the economy and I want to know whether the Government

has  considered reviewing its decision to grant the US$5 billion

loan in view of the present situation in Indonesia.  Is that not

part of it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, there is a Question related to

this topic later on in the Order Paper.  Could you wait for that

Question to be raised?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Sir. Then may I ask the

Minister  about the other question, and that is, the  off-Budget

measures.   May  I  know whether there are any measures  in  the

pipeline  to protect the workers?  Has the Government  heard  of

reports  that  companies  in  Woodlands  are  getting   rid   of

Singaporeans  and taking on board Malaysians because  they  find

them cheaper?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I suggest that when the Member

hears  of  these rumours, please document them and we will  look

into them individually.  As far as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>

Government's  action to help the workers, it is going  to  be  a

comprehensive package, including what we have said before,  that

one of the most important things that we need to do is to ensure

that  our  workers  will  be able to cope  with  new  jobs.   So

training and retraining is going to be a major focus.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether the

Government  is monitoring retrenchment of workers  by  Singapore

companies?  Is the Government monitoring or just turning a blind

eye?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think that is a very silly

question.   Surely, you do not expect the Government  to  be  so

negligent as not to monitor unemployment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Then tell us how you are monitoring it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Please address your question to the

Minister for Manpower.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  for  Finance,  as  and when  off-Budget  measures  are

introduced, besides addressing the issue of lowering the cost of

doing  business in Singapore and stimulating the economy through

infrastructure  projects, whether he will  consider  introducing

some   new   measures  to  encourage  companies  to  build   new

capabilities during this slowdown?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am aware of the Member's

sentiments.  It has appeared in the press and we will  certainly

take it into consideration.  I will discuss with my colleague.

<div align="center"><b>JTC AND HDB RENTALS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Rebates)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether JTC and HDB will grant rebates on  rentals  to

assist  the small and medium industries and shop tenants  during

this period of economic slowdown.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  his  Budget  Speech,  Minister  for  Finance

announced that the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) and the Housing

and  Development  Board  (HDB) would  extend  additional  rental

concessions  to tenants and lessees as part of the  Government's

efforts to moderate cost pressures on businesses.

Both  JTC and HDB have frozen their posted rents of land  leases

until  June next year.  JTC has also frozen the posted rents  of

its factories during this period.  In addition, JTC and HDB have

moderated the annual rental adjustments of their industrial land

and  premises.  About 70% of JTC lessees and 35% of HDB  lessees

who  are  paying at least 85% of market rent will  not  see  any

increase  in  their rents for the next 12 months. The  remaining

lessees  who  are paying rents that are well below market  rates

will have their rental adjustments capped at 4%.  JTC's existing

factory  tenants will also be given a rebate of up  to  half  of

their contracted rent adjustment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1996 and December 1997, HDB implemented a package of

rental  concessions  for its industrial and commercial  tenants.

This included moderating rental adjustments at third renewal  of

tenancies, granting up to 10% rental concession for those paying

above  market  rent,  and  staggering  increases  in  rent   for

subletting  and  assignment cases. About 10,000  commercial  and

industrial tenants (which are almost 50% of HDB's tenants)  have

benefited  from the rental adjustment policy to-date. The  total

impact of HDB's measures was revenue forgone of $220 million.

JTC  and  HDB will pass on to tenants the full 15% property  tax

rebate announced during this year's Budget Statement. They  will

also  make upfront collections of rental payments monthly rather

than quarterly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to monitor economic conditions

closely  and  take further measures, if necessary,  to  moderate

cost pressure on businesses.

together as they are related.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Political change in Indonesia has taken

place  peacefully  and constitutionally.  Political  and  social

unrest  has abated.  Nevertheless, the new Indonesian government

under  President  Habibie  faces  formidable  challenges.    The

Indonesian  economy has been badly damaged.  The rupiah  remains

weak.   Trade  financing for Indonesian exports and imports  has

practically  stopped.  Corporate debt restructuring  negotiation

is  not  yet  completed.  Unemployment is  growing.  Prices  are

rising sharply, including prices of necessities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia's changed political and economic situation does

not affect our commitment to implement practical schemes to help

Indonesia.   We  will proceed with our proposed bilateral  trade

finance guarantee scheme and humanitarian assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has already given the details of the

Bilateral Trade Finance Guarantee (BTFG) scheme  to the House on

20th April this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BTFG will initially provide export credit insurance for

Singapore's domestic exports to Indonesia.  Later, after we have

gained  some  experience with the scheme, it can be expanded  to

cover  retained  imports  from Indonesia  and  also  exports  to

Indonesia through Singapore by countries which do not have their

own  bilateral  export  credit  schemes.   The  scheme  will  be

operated  by  ECICS  Limited  using  Singapore-based  banks  and

designated trade finance banks in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Indonesian officials met on 20th April to

discuss  the  scheme.  After the first meeting,  the  Indonesian

officials  stated  that  they would need  to  study  the  scheme

further. The teams have not yet met again because of the  recent

events  in  Indonesia.  Singapore is ready to resume  discussion

with Indonesia when they are ready.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bilateral trade finance guarantee scheme replaced the

US$5  billion loan which Singapore had pledged in November  last

year  to  Indonesia as a back-up facility to supplement the  IMF

programme.   We  made  this  change  in  March  in  response  to

Indonesian  requests  that  Singapore  launch  a  trade  finance

guarantee scheme on its own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore believes that the bilateral trade finance

guarantee scheme can play a significant catalytic role to unlock

private sector capital to finance Indonesian trade.  The key  is

confidence - in Indonesian banks, exporters and importers.   The

trade finance guarantee scheme, with proper safeguards, can help

to  restore such confidence and encourage foreign banks to  open

or accept letters of credit for Indonesian trade.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On humanitarian assistance, the Singapore Red Cross had

launched  a  campaign  on  24th March this  year  to  raise  S$5

million.   The  money  will  be used to  buy  food  and  medical

supplies for needy Indonesians.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Is the bilateral trade financing scheme

contingent on the IMF resuming its loan to Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, the first priority for Indonesia

is  to  establish political certainty, stability and  confidence

because   these   are  critical  for  economic  recovery.    And

confidence  has to be signalled by international  agencies  like

the IMF and G7.  If there is confidence, then our scheme can  be

of  help.   If  there is no confidence, it is very difficult  to

make an impact.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> I would like

to  ask  the Deputy Prime Minister, in view of the almost  total

collapse  of  the Indonesian banking and financial system,  what

are the risks of the proposed bilateral trade financing scheme.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is one of the

concerns in designing the scheme because while, in principle, we

know  what  we  need to do, in practice, the scheme  has  to  be

crafted  in such a way that it achieves its objectives  and  the

benefits  flow to the targets.  In other words, it is meant  for

our  exports to Indonesia, and later on exports from  Indonesia,

and it is bona fide trade, and this is financing for that trade.

As  a result of the financing, trade will flow and, furthermore,

in due course, the loans will be repaid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a complicated matter to design the scheme to be

effective  as well as to safeguard against possible difficulties

in  implementation.  Trade financing is a very  specialised  and

complex  subject.  We have been consulting the experts in  order

to make sure we achieve our objectives.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask a

supplementary question on the issue of confidence building?   In

addition  to  the  trade  finance  guarantee  scheme,   is   the

Government taking any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>

other  measures  to help, in terms of confidence  building,  for

example,  in our contact with IMF or other agencies, that  would

help in the process of confidence building?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, to be quite candid, the issue of

confidence is something which the Indonesian government  has  to

address.   It  is  not  something which an outside  party,  like

Singapore,  however well-intentioned, can make a big  difference

to.  But the IMF can make a difference if they conclude that the

Indonesian  government  is  indeed  carrying  out  the   correct

measures and they signal that they approve of the measures which

the  Indonesian government is doing.  Perhaps the  great  powers

like  the US, maybe the EU, and perhaps Japan, if they similarly

signal  confidence, it would have some impact.  In the  case  of

Singapore,  I think the demonstration effect might  be  somewhat

less.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> May I ask the Deputy Prime

Minister  whether we have officially informed President  Habibie

that  our  offer  is  still valid, and  what  is  their  initial

response to our offer, if any?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, we have not made such an official

notification.  It is assumed so.  We have met the  officials  on

20th  April.   They have gone back. They are  studying  it.   We

expect  them  to  come back in due course and we  will  consider

their inputs in deciding our scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask whether it is the

Government's view that confidence in the Indonesian economy  can

only  be  restored  if  there  is a total  political  change  in

Indonesia,  and  not  just  replacing  personalities?   Has  the

Government any views on this and has it made any representations

to Indonesia to speed up the political reforms in Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I am aware that the hon. Member

regularly  calls  for total political change  in  Singapore  and

elsewhere.   It is not the practice of the Singapore  Government

to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are you not interested in the economy in

Indonesia?  Do you not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>

think that it would be best for Indonesia's economy if there  is

a total change?  Do you or do you not have any views?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already stated

that economic recovery depends on political certainty, stability

and  confidence.   As  to  whether the government  needs  to  be

changed and who should be the government, these are matters  for

the  Indonesian population and electorate to decide, not for the

Singapore Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> When we made the offer of loan

to  Indonesia, it was made against the background that Indonesia

has  not  defaulted on its sovereign loan.  But in view  of  the

current situation now, there is a possibility that they may  not

also similarly wait for signs of reform and recovery in both its

banking  and  financial  system before proceeding  to  make  any

disbursements.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained,

the  bilateral trade finance guarantee scheme, in fact, replaces

the  $5 billion loan which we had earlier proposed.  When we are

talking  about trade finance, the issue is the specific  parties

involved.   There are specific banks involved, and  the  parties

which  guarantee the banks.  Of course, if all that fails,  then

finally  it  becomes  a  sovereign debt  owed  by  Indonesia  to

Singapore.   That is why we are in the process of designing  the

scheme  so  that it operates with parties which  are  sound  and

which will be able to carry through the deals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development,  in  the  light  of the  slowdown  in  the  economy

resulting  in  the inability of developers to sell  their  newly

launched  properties,  whether  there  is  any  danger  of  some

developers   becoming  insolvent,  and,  if  so,   whether   the

Government  will  be  taking steps to protect  the  interest  of

Singaporeans who have purchased properties from such developers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like other sectors of

the  economy, the real estate industry has been affected by  the

current  economic slowdown. Weak property sales will affect  the

bottom   line  of  developers,  and  we  cannot  rule  out   the

possibility  that some could become insolvent, as in  any  other

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard the interest of property purchasers, the

Housing  Developers (Control and Licensing) Act  requires  every

licensed  developer  to  deposit all  the  sale  proceeds  of  a

building  project  into a project account.  The  moneys  in  the

project account can only be withdrawn for authorised purposes  - such as payment of building works and architect's fees - for the

completion  of  the  project. In the event  that  the  developer

becomes insolvent, all the moneys in the project account will be

deemed  not to form part of the property of the developer.  They

will  instead  be  vested in the official receiver,  trustee  in

bankruptcy  or the liquidator, as the case may be, and  continue

to  be  used only for the authorised purposes for the completion

of  the  project. The Government may also direct  a  company  or

statutory  board to assume control and carry on the  development

of the insolvent developer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I take Questions 16

and 17 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The prices of residential units had

fallen  by 9.1% in first quarter of 1998.  Cumulatively,  prices

had  fallen by 24.2% since the second quarter of 1996.  However,

the  sales  of uncompleted units had increased by 17.3%  in  the

first quarter of 1998 compared to the last quarter of 1997.   As

at  first  quarter  of 1998, there was an accumulated  stock  of

about  8,900  units that had been launched  but  not  sold.   In

addition,  there  were about 11,500 units  that  have  not  been

launched  yet.   The occupancy rate of the completed  units  had

remained fairly stable at about 91%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the regional economic turmoil, it is generally

expected  that  demand for private residential  properties  will

remain  weak.   However,  the success of  some  recent  property

launches  indicates  that there is a pool  of  potential  buyers

willing to enter the market at the right price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government had, in November last year, suspended the

stamp  duty  payable on properties sold within  three  years  of

purchase  and  made  other adjustments to the Government's  land

sales  programme and to the project completion period  specified

for residential land sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not think there is a need to make further refinements

to  the financial rules on residential property transactions  or

to  introduce  other  adjustments at this point  in  time.   The

Government,  however,  will continue to  monitor  the  situation

closely.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry if he will give an update on the impact of the regional

economic  crisis on the cost of living in Singapore and  whether

Singaporeans on the whole experience a lower standard of  living

as a result.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the regional economic

crisis  has not pushed up our cost of living.  In fact, consumer

prices rose by only 1.1% in the first quarter of 1998, down from

1.7%  and  2.3%  in  the  first half and  second  half  of  1997

respectively.

There  are three reasons for the low inflation.  First, although

the  Singapore dollar has depreciated against the US dollar,  it

has  strengthened against the regional currencies.  Overall, the

Singapore  dollar  has remained relatively stable  on  a  trade-weighted  basis.   This  has  kept imported  inflation  at  bay.

Second,  domestic inflationary pressures are low as a result  of

slower  economic activity, weaker consumer sentiments and keener

retail  competition.   Third, commodity  prices  like  oil  have

declined.

Our  standard  of  living has not deteriorated.   Nominal  wages

increased  by  4.8%  in  the first quarter  of  1998.   With  an

inflation rate of 1.1%, real wages have risen by 3.7%, the  same

as in 1997.

<div align="center"><b>ASEAN PLUS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Details)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether he will elaborate on the details of the mechanism in the

proposed early financial warning system, the ASEAN Plus.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for a

regional  surveillance  mechanism within  ASEAN  was  recognised

during  the First ASEAN Finance Ministers' Meeting in Phuket  in

March 1997 before the outbreak of the regional financial crisis.

The  onset of the regional financial crisis gave impetus to this

initiative.   In November 1997, ASEAN central banks  established

the  ASEAN  Central Bank Forum (ACBF), and this was followed  by

the  formation  of the Select Committee of Finance  and  Central

Bank Officials called the ASEAN Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ACBF carries out regional surveillance with the

technical  support  of  the  IMF  and  complements  the   global

surveillance  work  of the IMF. It aims at evaluating  potential

economic  and  financial risks of member countries, highlighting

policy options and implications, and encouraging early action to

minimise  such  risks.  The ACBF recently concluded  its  second

meeting in Jakarta on 8th-9th May 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Early Financial Warning System mentioned in press

reports  refers  to  a proposal to establish an  ASEAN  Economic

Monitoring   Mechanism  (AEMM)  to  support   the   surveillance

initiative.  ASEAN Finance Ministers agreed during their  second

meeting  in Jakarta in February this year to a proposal  by  the

Philippines  that  the  ADB be asked to  provide  technical  and

secretariat  support  for the surveillance  process  during  the

first  two  years,  with a view to the ASEAN Secretariat  taking

over thereafter.  The ADB and the ASEAN Secretariat had proposed

to  establish the AEMM during the ADB Meeting in Geneva in April

this  year.   However, at that meeting, ASEAN Finance  Ministers

have agreed that the proposal requires further careful study.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that arrangements for the establishment

of  the  surveillance  mechanism are primarily  focused  on  the

meeting  of ASEAN's needs, contrary to the impression  given  in

newspapers (and quoted in the above question), about it being an

"ASEAN plus".  ASEAN Finance Ministers have, however, agreed  to

meet  with the Japanese Finance Minister on a regular  basis  to

exchange  views.  The first such meeting was held at the  fringe

of  the  ADB Meeting in Geneva this year.  Japan's Vice-Minister

for  Finance, Dr Eisuke Sakakibara, who represented his Minister

at  the Meeting, had dubbed this meeting "ASEAN Plus", and  that

is how it originated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, on "ASEAN Plus", is the

financial  system in the ASEAN countries transparent  enough  to

make "ASEAN Plus" effective?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The whole idea of this ASEAN

surveillance  mechanism  is,  in fact,  to  produce  a  list  of

statistical data which participating member countries  would  be

prepared to divulge.  Because it is a complex process, therefore

it  is  now being studied very carefully by the deputies of  the

Finance  Ministers  to  ensure  that  the  list  of  statistical

information   required  is  detailed  enough   and   meets   the

requirements for proper surveillance.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> May I ask the Minister: is it

envisaged  that this monitoring system will eventually  lead  to

the  establishment  of  some financial arrangement  or  fund  to

assist  countries deemed to be in distress or where distress  is

anticipated?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Not at all. That is not the

objective at all.  There will be no special fund outside the IMF

arrangements.   All  the  current  arrangements  are   bilateral

agreements.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Could the results of the analysis of the

ASEAN surveillance mechanism be publicised?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Initially, the data would be

exchanged between the participating countries themselves.  I  do

not  think at this point of time it has been considered  whether

the data should be published.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I recall that in the case of Thailand

when  their financial crisis first started, I think IMF had said

that  they actually mentioned to Thailand that there was trouble

but  no  action was taken.  So supposing that in this case,  the

surveillance results do show that there is actually a  potential

problem  in  one of the ASEAN countries, what sort of  follow-up

action will be taken then?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It is envisaged that peer pressure

from the other participating countries would hopefully influence

the government to take some action.  Publicising it or revealing

the  details  to the public at large, I think, really  does  not

solve the problem.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

if he will give an update on the situation of illegal immigrants

from Indonesia since the outbreak of riots in the country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there  has  not been any  influx  of  Indonesian

illegal  immigrants since the outbreak of unrest  in  Indonesia.

Police  arrested only 77 Indonesian illegal immigrants  on  land

and  at sea in May, compared to 258 in April.  Potential illegal

immigrants should know that they will be discovered and punished

for  illegal entry into Singapore.  Intensive police  operations

have also crippled illegal immigrant smuggling activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Coast Guard will continue to be vigilant against

illegals coming by sea.  On land, Police will continue to  mount

operations against illegal immigrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue with our very strict and tough stance

against  all illegal immigrants, their employers and  those  who

harbour  them.   The Police, Immigration and the other  agencies

will spare no effort

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>

to  detect  and  deal firmly with offenders.  We will  take  all

necessary  actions  to  stay on top  of  the  illegal  immigrant

situation,  to ensure that the safety and security of  Singapore

is not compromised.

<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Enforcement action)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Cyrille Tan -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether his Ministry

(i)  is  planning any new measures to stem the flow  of  illegal

immigrants that the country is facing and (ii) has compiled  and

analysed  any statistical data linking this increased inflow  of

illegal immigrants to the crime rates in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Question No. 21, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, since March 1998, the Police has

intensified  its  enforcement action against illegal  immigrants

(IIs).    Police   has  raided  various  II  haunts,   including

construction  sites, workplaces, forested areas,  HDB  flats  as

well  as  lodging  houses.  The Police  Coast  Guard  (PCG)  has

stepped  up  both  sea  and shore patrols to  detect  those  who

attempt to enter by sea.  PCG also uses sophisticated radars  to

detect illegal immigrants attempting to enter Singapore by sea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Immigration and Registration (SIR) has also been

playing its part.  It has stepped up its checks at our air, land

and  sea border entry points to detect the smuggling of IIs into

Singapore  and also turning away suspected illegal  workers  who

try to come to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team's intensified enforcement action so far has

yielded  good  results and kept the II situation under  control.

However,  because of the regional downturn, the risk  of  people

sneaking into Singapore illegally is still high.  We should keep

up  our  guard.  In addition to Police and Singapore Immigration

and  Registration  continuing rigorous  enforcement  action,  my

Ministry  is  amending  the  Immigration  Act  to  enhance   its

deterrent effect of the law against immigration offences.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team has taken several measures to spread the

message  to potential IIs that Singapore is serious in  tackling

the  illegal immigration problem, and that the penalties in  our

laws  are  severe.  Since early April 1998, SIR started  handing

out  notices in the form of flyers to all immigration  offenders

who were repatriated after they have served their sentences,  so

that   they  can  send  the  message  to  potential  immigration

offenders  back  home.   The  notice  carries  messages  on  the

seriousness  of illegal entry and the penalties associated  with

it, and are translated into the four official languages, as well

as  in  Thai, Myanmar and Bangladeshi languages.  SIR  has  also

started  screening  a  video clip on IIs at  Tanah  Merah  Ferry

Terminal,  World  Trade Centre and on board  ferry  boats.   The

video  clip  shows how the Home Team agencies  have  stepped  up

their enforcement efforts to curb the II problem, eg. stepped up

action  by PCG, police raids at construction sites, and  so  on.

The  message  that we convey is that anyone who tries  to  enter

Singapore illegally will be arrested, punished and deported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about crime rates and IIs? The number of IIs arrested

for  crimes  in 1997 averaged 13 per month.  For the first  four

months of this year, the average figure was 23.  Although  there

is  an increase, the absolute number is negligible compared with

the overall crime picture from January to April 1998 where there

was  a  monthly average of 1,468 arrested for various  offences.

Therefore, there is no cause for alarm for the present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told Dr Yaacob Ibrahim at the last Parliament sitting,

the  crime situation presently is under control.  The fact  that

more illegal immigrants are arrested does not so far indicate  a

deterioration  in  the  security  situation  in  Singapore.   My

Ministry  will continue to monitor the situation and take  steps

to  ensure that the law and order situation continues to  remain

under control.

measures to protect people at bus stops from being hit by  motor

vehicles  are  being implemented islandwide  and  whether  these

measures are effective.



<div align="center"><b>CONSTRUCTION OF BARRIERS AT BUS STANDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  whether  he  will construct  barriers  or  other

devices at bus stands to protect commuters waiting for buses  at

such stands.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Sir, can I take

Questions 22 and 23 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Road safety at bus stops depends

on  both design and driver behaviour. Our bus stops are designed

to  international  standards.  Like  pedestrian  footpaths,  bus

stops  are segregated from the road carriageway by raised kerbs.

Where  space  permits, we provide a bus bay  so  that  commuters

waiting at the bus stop are even further away from the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "yellow band" is drawn along the kerb at the bus stop as

a  visual  guide to commuters to stay away from the  kerb,  much

like  that  on  MRT  station platforms.  This  yellow  band  has

already been painted at more than half of the 4,200 bus stops in

Singapore.  The rest should be completed in a few months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At certain bus bays along very busy roads, markers have

been  erected on the kerb before the approach to the bay.  These

are  designed to guide bus drivers to stay clear of the bus stop

when they pull into the bay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are suggestions that barriers be set up at the bus

stops. These have been previously tried out.  Our experience  is

that  these  barriers  impede  passenger  flow  and  result   in

commuters moving into the bus bay or road itself.  Worse  still,

commuters may find themselves sandwiched between incoming  buses

and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>

barriers,  especially when there is a rush.  In such  instances,

barriers can become an obstacle and a danger.  On balance, it is

not advisable to install barriers at bus stops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continuously look out for new ideas to enhance the

safety of our bus stops but, ultimately, it is the behaviour  of

drivers  and road users that determines safety along  the  roads

and  the bus stops.  All drivers bear a great responsibility  in

ensuring  safety  when  they drive.   They  should  pay  careful

attention  in  the  way they handle their vehicles  and  keep  a

proper look out for pedestrians.  To further emphasise and clamp

down  on  those  drivers  with  careless  and  dangerous  driver

behaviour,  the  Traffic  Police has introduced  regulations  to

suspend  extreme speedsters and penalise those using  handphones

without  hands-free car kits.  The success of these moves  would

enhance road safety for all pedestrians.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, is it not possible

for the Government to find a way to build barriers in which they

will not impede the flow of passengers?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, if you build the barrier in

front  of  the  bus stop, what happens is that, especially  when

there  is  a crowd, the passengers will tend to flow on  to  the

road.   So  that itself will create a danger and  it  will  also

impede the flow because they will not be able to get to the  bus

fast enough and that would not be acceptable.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, two supplementary

questions.   As mentioned by the Minister, where space  permits,

bus  bays  will  be  incorporated.  But the recent  accident  at

Bendemeer  Road, which is a major trunk road, the bus stop  does

not  have  a bus bay.  Is there any guideline on where we  would

have  bus  bays? Given the fact that Bendemeer Road is  a  major

trunk road, I think a bus bay would be very useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that in previous years, to the best

of my recollection, because of accidents by buses, bollards have

been  raised  at  certain bus stops, some  of  which  are  along

Clementi Road in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>

front  of  the university.  Would that measure be effective  and

implemented island-wide?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I said, bus bays depend on

whether we have enough space.  So that is the criterion.  If  we

have,  we  will  do  it, especially along busy  roads.   As  for

bollards,  they  are  also  barriers in  a  certain  sense  and,

therefore, they create a danger.  We have to be mindful that  we

do  not  introduce  something which will  create  other  dangers

because  if commuters were to stand in front of the bollards  or

sitting on the bollards, when the buses come and if they are too

close,  there will also be a danger.  So we are mindful that  we

should  not  create other dangers just because we want  to  have

these barriers.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister of State regarding the international standards  of  the

bus  stops.  May I ask him to enlighten the House which  one  of

the standards he has chosen and what are the key safety features

which  have been adopted?  Also, would the Ministry take  action

against  any organisation which builds makeshift bus  stops  for

whatever purpose?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, we have looked at many

countries  -  UK,  Australia, US - and we  have  not  found  any

country which has barriers in front of the bus stops.  In  fact,

if  you look at the features of our bus stops, I would say  that

the  features  that  I  mentioned earlier are  more  than  those

implemented  by other countries.  So rest assured that  we  have

not   been  found  wanting  in  implementing  all  these  safety

measures.   We  have looked far and wide for  all  the  possible

ideas.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would

appear  that  the bus stop accidents occurred around  bends  and

where   there  is  merging  traffic.   In  the  light  of  these

circumstances,  would the Minister of State perhaps  review  and

resite  the bus stops that are located in these dangerous  areas

and even consider barriers just for these places?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the LTA will survey all bus

stops and areas where there is a bend, and so on.  Of course, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>

will put up additional signs and measures on the road to prevent

speeding.  But let me point out that the root cause of all these

safety  problems  is  really  the driving  habit  of  motorists.

Therefore,  I would urge the House to really help the Government

to  send  a  strong message to Singaporeans that such  behaviour

would  kill lives.  The motorists are given a machine which  can

take  away lives and, therefore, it is more important for us  to

tell  the  motorists that such reckless behaviour would  not  be

tolerated.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, on the issue of bollards, to the

best of my recollection, they are not placed in front of the bus

stop but away from the bus stop, because there is a bus bay.  So

are  there any studies done to show that this measure  has  been

effective  and, if so, are we planning to implement  it  island-wide?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as explained in my answer,

those  bollards  or markers are not designed  to  withstand  the

impact  and the purpose of those markers or bollards is actually

to  guide the drivers as they approach the bus bay so that  they

will  not  get  too close to the kerb and pose a danger  to  the

commuters.   From  our study, it has been very  useful  for  bus

drivers to know how far to keep away from the kerb and, in fact,

there are over 100 bus stops in Singapore with such bollards.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I just want to know

whether  the  Ministry has any immediate plans  to  improve  the

safety of the bus stops at Bendemeer Road.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as far as I know, there is no

immediate  plan.  But we will look into whether we  can  improve

the  safety of the stretch of the road and see what we  can  do.

Those  measures that I have mentioned are ongoing and they  will

be implemented.

<div align="center"><b>DANGEROUS DRIVING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Enhancement of penalty)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if

the  maximum penalty for dangerous driving needs to be  enhanced

for more effective deterrence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng</b>

<b>Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, existing

penalties  for  dangerous driving are adequate.    Police  takes

strict  enforcement action against motorists  who  endanger  the

lives of other road-users by driving dangerously or recklessly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, the Road Traffic Act was amended to enhance the

penalties  for dangerous driving.  We tripled the  maximum  fine

and  doubled the maximum jail sentence for this offence.  Hence,

anyone who drives a motor vehicle dangerously or recklessly  can

now  be fined up to $3,000 (up from $1,000) or jailed up to  one

year (up from six months), or both.  The penalties for a second-time  offender are more severe.   He can be fined up  to  $5,000

(up  from $2,000) or jailed up to two years (up from one  year),

or both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, anyone who causes the death of another person by

dangerous  or  reckless driving will be jailed for  up  to  five

years when convicted.  Imprisonment is mandatory.  Regardless of

whether  he  has any previous conviction for dangerous  driving,

the  Court  has  the  power to ban him from  driving  for  life,

depending on the severity of the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A motorist who has at least two previous convictions for

dangerous or reckless driving can be punished up to three  times

the penalty that he would otherwise have received, subject to  a

maximum jail term of 10 years if a jail term is imposed.   If he

had  caused  serious  injury or death when he  is  convicted  of

dangerous  or reckless driving for the third time or  more,  the

Court may also impose caning of up to six strokes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Road Traffic Act was also amended in 1996 to ensure

that  any person who is convicted of dangerous driving, but  has

two previous convictions of driving under the influence of drink

or drugs or failing to give blood or breath specimen, or driving

while  under suspension or disqualification, is liable  for  the

same  enhanced  penalty  as one who is  convicted  of  dangerous

driving for the third time or more.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more recently, the Road Traffic Rules were amended to

further  deter  dangerous driving.   With effect from  1st  June

1998, a motorist will be given 24 demerit points instead of  the

previous  12  points for the offence of dangerous driving.    In

addition,  his  driving licence can be suspended  for  up  to  a

period  of  three  years.    Any motorist who  is  suspended  or

disqualified  from driving for at least one year will  lose  his

driving  licence, and will have to re-sit for, and pass,  a  new

driving test to regain his licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also currently reviewing the Road Traffic Act,

and  target to introduce the Amendment Bill in Parliament  later

this   year.    We   are  considering  empowering   the   Deputy

Commissioner  of  Police  to  immediately  suspend  the  driving

licences  of  those  who  cause death by dangerous  or  reckless

driving  even  before they are charged in court.    This  is  to

prevent  the offender from driving after the fatal accident  and

putting other road users at risk during the period before he  is

charged in court.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY DRIVERS USING HANDPHONES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of existing penalties)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether  there  has been an increasing trend of  road  accidents

caused  by drivers who were using their handphones while driving

and,  if  so, whether he will review the existing penalties  for

such cases.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home</b>

<b>Affairs):</b> Sir, no accident case has yet been directly

attributed  to  handphone  driving. But  it  certainly  poses  a

serious  hazard.  Police  issued an  average  of  179  handphone

driving summonses each month in 1997. The average went up 23% to

221  in  the first four months of this year.   Hence, from  18th

May  1998, Police have begun seizing handphones when they  issue

summonses for handphone driving.  Traffic Police will  apply  to

the Courts to have these phones confiscated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the offence can be compounded with a fine of $170 and

nine demerit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>

points.   Traffic  Police  will monitor  the  handphone  driving

situation  closely.    If motorists persist  in  this  dangerous

practice,  Traffic Police will consider charging such  motorists

in  court.  If convicted, they can be fined up to $1,000  and/or

up  to  six  months' jail, plus nine demerit points.   A  repeat

offender  can be fined up to $2,000 or be jailed up to one  year

or both.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, are there any plans to mount a

public  education  programme to discourage  drivers  from  using

handphones while driving?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think this topic has been

in  the news repeatedly when cases are highlighted.  I think all

drivers  know that Police takes a very serious view of handphone

driving.  So there is no need for a dedicated campaign.

injured  by  motor  vehicles on our roads are readily  available

only  for  the  period 1992-1997.  On average, 15 cyclists  were

killed  and  17 seriously injured each year in road accidents  .

A bicycle is currently already classified as a vehicle under the

Road  Traffic Act, and bicycle riders are deemed to  be  vehicle

drivers.    Under  both  Road Traffic  and  Pedestrian  Crossing

Rules,  it  is  an offence to cycle on a footway  or  pedestrian

crossing.

<div align="center"><b>MISUSE OF DRUGS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the last amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA)

in  1993, both the global and local drug situations have changed

significantly.  Further amendments to the MDA are now  necessary

so  that we can continue to effectively curb drug abuse and drug

trafficking in Singapore.

<br><br><i>"Ice" and "Ecstasy"</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, psychotropic drugs are increasingly emerging as a

major global threat. The UN International Drug Control Programme

has  reported that synthetic and psychotropic drugs  will  be  a

problem  of  global  concern in the 21st  century.  Psychotropic

drugs  are  synthetic substances made entirely  from  chemicals.

They  act  on  the central nervous system and have mind-altering

effects   which   can   have  stimulating,   tranquillising   or

hallucinating  effects.   Besides inducing  adverse  changes  in

behaviour,  these drugs can also have extremely harmful  effects

on the body.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice" and "Ecstasy" are examples of psychotropic drugs.

These  drugs  are  easy to produce and can be manufactured  from

easily  obtainable  chemicals and  raw  materials  in  makeshift

laboratories.   I  am  told  that "Ice",  for  example,  can  be

produced   using  ephedrine,  several  washtubs  and  a   stove.

"Ecstasy" causes hallucinations, anxiety and can cause death  by

overheating  of  the body or dehydration.  "Ice"  is  even  more

harmful  and  lethal.  It is known to cause severe  convulsions,

hallucinations, liver and kidney damage, cardiac damage,  stroke

and  death.   "Ice" abusers are also prone to violent  behaviour

after  abusing  it.   Although  not  yet  rampantly  abused   in

Singapore,  "Ice"  currently poses a major  threat  due  to  its

widespread and growing popularity in the region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, no "Ecstasy" abuser was arrested in 1995.

But  in 1996, 661 were arrested.  The number fell to 403 in 1997

after  intensive  CNB enforcement.  In 1995, no   "Ecstasy"  was

seized.   But in 1996, almost 39,000 were seized, and  in  1997,

almost 55,000 "Ecstasy" pills were seized.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No "Ice" abuser was arrested in 1995 also. But 5 were

arrested  in  1996  and  82 in 1997.  There  has  also  been  an

increase  in  "Ice" trafficking activities  in  Singapore.    In

1995,  12.3  grammes were seized and in 1996, 0.69 grammes  were

seized.   But in 1997,  90.3 grammes were seized.   But  in  the

first  four  months of this year, we have already seized   about

560 grammes of "Ice", due to the success of major CNB operations

like Operation Phantom.

<br><br><i>Enhanced Penalties for "Ice" and "Ecstasy" Traffickers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Ecstasy" abuse situation today is under

control, we must act decisively to ensure that it does not  gain

a   foothold   in   Singapore.   Stricter  legislation   against

traffickers of "Ecstasy" and "Ice" will also deter international

syndicates  from  using  Singapore as a transhipment  point  for

these drugs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes that the Act be amended to facilitate

the prosecution of "Ice" and "Ecstasy" traffickers.  Clause 7 of

the  Bill amends section 17 of the Act to extend the presumption

clause for trafficking to include "Ice" and "Ecstasy".  A person

caught  in  possession of more than 25 grammes of  "Ice"  or  10

grammes  of  "Ecstasy"  is presumed to be trafficking  in  these

drugs and would be charged with the offence of trafficking  Thus

the  burden of proof against trafficking would rightly be placed

on  the offender.  These amounts, ie, 25 grammes of "Ice" and 10

grammes  of  "Ecstasy"  are  equivalent  to  100  doses  of  the

estimated  daily consumption of these drugs.  This is  the  same

basis for deriving the presumption amounts for other drugs  such

as heroin, opium, morphine and cocaine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clauses 21(a) to (c) of the Bill amend the

Second  Schedule of the MDA to make the death penalty  mandatory

for anyone who is convicted of trafficking,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>

manufacturing, importing or exporting more than 250  grammes  of

"Ice".  This  amount is equivalent to 1,000 doses of  the  daily

estimated  consumption of the drug. This is also the  basis  for

deriving the amount attracting capital punishment for the  other

drugs  which  I  mentioned.   Unlike "Ice"  which  is  extremely

dangerous,  "Ecstasy" is less potent and dangerous.  Hence,  MHA

is  not  proposing at this stage to introduce the death  penalty

for "Ecstasy"-related offences.  Nevertheless, the penalties are

still  heavy  as  "Ecstasy" is a Class  A  drug.   For  example,

trafficking in "Ecstasy" currently attracts a maximum penalty of

20 years' imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and a minimum

penalty of 5 years' imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.

<br><br><i>Hardcore Addicts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the next set of amendments, which are

related  to  the proposed long-term imprisonment and caning  for

hardcore drug addicts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the overall drug situation in Singapore has

improved, the problem of a large number of hardcore addicts  who

repeatedly relapse still remains. A hardcore addict is  one  who

has  been admitted to DRC or Prison for a drug offence for  more

than  two  times.  In fact, the proportion of  hardcore  addicts

among our total DRC population has increased from 65% in 1994 to

71% in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that these hardcore drug addicts are not treated

as  victims.   They  are  bad people.  Firstly,  to  feed  their

expensive habit, many of them turn to crime.  More than  73%  of

hardcore  drug addicts have some form of criminal record,  while

about  76%  of  all addicts with criminal records  are  hardcore

addicts.  So, they are criminals also.  Secondly, these hardcore

addicts  contaminate the innocent and lead  them  to  experiment

with,  and  consume  drugs, thus perpetuating  a  drug  culture.

Every  addict,  especially a hardcore  addict,  is  a  potential

pusher  and  trafficker.  These hardcore  addicts  also  inflict

untold  misery on their families and are a financial  burden  to

their  family members.  They are bad role models, especially  if

they are fathers or mothers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Long Term Imprisonment and Caning for Hardcore Addicts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Act is amended to provide for long-term

imprisonment  and caning for hardcore addicts.   This  serves  a

number of objectives.  Firstly, by putting these addicts out  of

circulation for a long time, it will help to protect the  public

from  them, especially as the majority of these addicts turn  to

crime  to  feed  their habit.    Secondly, it is also  aimed  at

deterring  drug addicts from persisting in their drug  addiction

by  making the consequences of continued addiction very  severe.

In  the  long run, the long-term imprisonment and caning  should

help  to  reduce  the  relapse rate of drug  addicts  and  deter

potential drug abusers from falling into the drug trap. Thirdly,

it  is to punish these recalcitrant addicts for persisting  with

their  drug  habit. Public reaction to my announcement  that  we

would   enhance  punishment  for  hardcore  addicts,  has   been

positive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill will introduce a new section 33A in the

MDA  to  provide for this new regime. Upon conviction in  Court,

hardcore addicts would be given a mandatory imprisonment term of

between  five and seven years and between three and six  strokes

of the cane under the first  tier penalty. Under the second tier

penalty,  any addict who has been punished under the first  tier

penalty and who is arrested again for a drug consumption offence

will,  upon  conviction, be punished with a longer  imprisonment

term of between 7 and 13 years, and between 6 and 12 strokes  of

the  cane.  For the purpose of prosecuting an addict under  this

new  section,  the Government will only rely on  DRC  admissions

and drug conviction records on or after 1st October 1992.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current intention is to only target the long-term

imprisonment  regime and caning at hardcore  abusers  of  opiate

drugs, ie, heroin, opium and morphine.    This is because  among

the  various  drugs  of abuse, opiate drugs have  the  strongest

physical  and  psychological hold over their  users.    Besides,

these are the main drugs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>

abused  in Singapore, with more than 75% of all addicts arrested

each  year  since  1994  abusing  these  drugs.    However,  the

Government  will carefully monitor the situation  and  will  not

hesitate to impose similar measures against hardcore addicts  of

other drugs, such as "Ice", should the situation warrant it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related amendment is to enhance the penalty for failing to

provide  urine  specimen under section 31(2)  to  that  of  drug

consumption.   The former offence, ie, failure to provide  urine

sample,   refers to instances where arrested addicts  refuse  to

provide  urine  samples for testing purposes without  reasonable

excuse  when  asked  to  do so.   This amendment  is  necessary.

Otherwise, suspected drug addicts would rather refuse to provide

a  urine specimen and be only liable for a lesser penalty  of  a

maximum  $5000 fine under section 31(2), than be liable for  the

harsher penalties of drug consumption.  Clause 21(f) would amend

the  Second  Schedule of the Act to equate the penalty  for  the

offence  of  failing to provide urine specimen with the  penalty

for drug consumption. For the same reason, clause 14 would amend

section  33(3)  to  include a previous offence  for  failing  to

provide  urine  sample  as a previous drug  antecedent  for  the

purpose of sentencing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the new regime of long-term imprisonment and caning will

apply  to  addicts who are caught for the consumption of  opiate

drugs  or  fail  to  provide  urine sample,  and  have,  let  me

elaborate:

(a) at least two previous DRC admissions for opiate abuse; or

(b) at least two previous convictions for opiate abuse; or

(c)  at least two previous convictions for failure to provide  a

urine specimen; or

(d)  one previous DRC admission and one previous conviction  for

opiate abuse; or

(e)  one previous DRC admission and one previous conviction  for

failure to provide urine sample; or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>

(f)  one  previous conviction for opiate abuse and one  previous

conviction for failure to provide urine specimen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A previous conviction by a subordinate military court for the

opiate  abuse  will also be considered as a previous  conviction

for purposes of sentencing.

<br><br><i>Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction over Offence of Drug Consumption</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to turn to the issue of consumption of controlled

drugs  outside  Singapore.    Currently,  only  consumption   of

controlled drugs within Singapore is punishable under  the  MDA.

The  Central Narcotics Bureau cannot charge persons  who  abused

drugs  overseas, say, in Malaysia, Batam, Bintan or Karimun,  or

anywhere  else, and tested positive for drugs upon their  return

at our immigration entry points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a noticeable trend of Singaporeans consuming

drugs  overseas  in recent years. In 1994, 1,402 persons  tested

positive for drug consumption at our checkpoints.  In 1997,  the

figure was 1,768 persons or a 26% increase over the 1994 figure.

With  more Singaporeans travelling overseas, the easy access  of

drugs  nearby in neighbouring countries and the proposed harsher

penalties  for  hardcore addicts, it is  prudent  to  plug  this

loophole.    Otherwise, local addicts would  intentionally  make

trips  out  of Singapore to neighbouring countries to get  their

fixes to avoid arrest and prosecution in Singapore, and to  make

a  mockery  of  our drug laws.   Clause 5 of the Amendment  Bill

would  create  a  new section 8A to confer  on  our  Courts  the

jurisdiction to try the offence of drug consumption overseas  by

a  Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident whose urine  sample

was  found positive in Singapore and to deal with them as though

the act of consumption was committed  in Singapore.

<br><br><i>1988  UN  Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotics  Drugs and Psychotropic Substances</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have taken firm and incisive actions against drug

abuse  and  trafficking  domestically, we  remain  committed  to

international efforts to stamp out the drug

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>

problem.     This is because drugs and the proceeds  from  drug-related activities are global problems that respect no borders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Singapore is committed to tackling

international   drug  trafficking,  importing,   exporting   and

manufacturing.     It  has acceded to the three  United  Nations

drug  abuse  conventions: namely, the 1961 Single Convention  on

Narcotic  Drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances,

and,  late last year, the 1988 United Nations Convention Against

Illicit Traffic In Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1988 UN Convention, or the Vienna Convention, as it is

commonly known, is an international co-ordinated effort to  make

it   mandatory   for  signatory  states  to  criminalise   drug-trafficking   and   its  related  activities,  including   money

laundering  and the use of precursor chemicals in  manufacturing

controlled  drugs.    We only formally acceded  to  it  on  21st

October  1997 because we wanted to first put in place the  legal

framework,  which  is  necessary if we are  to  fully  meet  our

obligations as a signatory state to the Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 21 of the Bill would amend the MDA to allow

Singapore  to  give effect to its obligations under  the  Vienna

Convention.      For   example,   we   would   criminalise   the

manufacture, possession and distribution of precursor chemicals,

controlled  materials and equipment intended for the manufacture

of  controlled  drugs.  The penalties would be a maximum  of  20

years' imprisonment or $200,000 fine or both.  A new section 18B

of  the  MDA would empower the Minister to make regulations  for

various  matters relating to the control of precursor chemicals,

and controlled materials and equipment, such as the licensing of

their  import  and  export, and documentation  requirements  for

their  transhipment.   A related amendment is  clause  23  which

amends  the  First Schedule of the Extradition  Act  to  include

offences   relating  to  psychotropic  substances  and  offences

relating   to   benefits  derived  from  drug   trafficking   as

extraditable  offences.    The latter is one of the  obligations

of signatory states under the Vienna Convention.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Amendment Bill also proposes various amendments

that  are essential to facilitate drug enforcement and to  allow

the  Prisons  Department  and the Central  Narcotics  Bureau  to

operate more effectively.  For example, clauses 8, 9, 13 and  18

of  the  Bill  would strengthen the enforcement  powers  of  CNB

officers  in  relation to investigation, search  and  arrest  of

offenders under the MDA and its Regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill would provide for the mandatory forfeiture

of  any vehicle used in connection with an MDA offence.     This

is  in  line  with  similar provisions  for  the  forfeiture  of

vehicles in other legislation such as the Road Traffic  Act  and

the Immigration Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also recall last year's ruling by the Court of

Appeal that "life imprisonment" should be equated to the natural

life  of a prisoner, rather than 20 years, as practised  by  the

Prisons.    Currently,  some  MDA  offences  attract  a  maximum

imprisonment term of 30 years and 15 strokes of the cane.     To

uphold  the  original policy intention that  the  penalties  for

these  offences  should be more severe than  life  imprisonment,

which  was  then  taken to be 20 years, clause 20  of  the  Bill

provides for "imprisonment for life" as an additional sentencing

option for these offences.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, the proposed amendments would allow my

Ministry  to  respond  effectively  to  the  ever-changing  drug

situation  and to sufficiently deter drug abuse and  other  drug

related  offences.    The overall drug situation  may  be  under

control today, but we must never rest on our laurels.   However,

in  addition  to tough laws and strict enforcement,  I  wish  to

assure  Members  that  my Ministry would continue  to  focus  on

preventive   drug   education,  treatment,  rehabilitation   and

aftercare  of  recovering addicts who are  amenable  to  change.

Only by adopting a comprehensive approach towards drugs would we

eradicate the drug problem in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the overall drug situation in Singapore remains under

control,  in  fact,  since April last year,  there  has  been  a

decrease in the number of drug addicts being detected.  However,

as the Minister said, the percentage of hardcore addicts remains

high,  and this problem has to be addressed urgently,  as  these

addicts  not  only become a menace to the society,  and  causing

untold  anguish  to  the family, but very  often  they  turn  to

criminal activities in order to support their habit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also recognised that early conversion of these addicts has

a  higher  rate of success in helping them live a  normal  life.

The  longer  these addicts get into the habit,  the  chances  of

recovery   would   decrease   dramatically.    Therefore,    the

introduction  of  section 33A(1) and (2) on the  enhancement  of

punishment for this category of third and fourth time  offenders

is timely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since notice was given two years ago, I understand that

there  has been a drop in the number of third timers. The reason

is  that  the second timers know that if they persist  in  their

drug  taking,  they will be faced with a much harsher  and  more

severe punishment.  Therefore, it is necessary to carry out this

severe punishment as much resources are being committed to  help

the first and second timers to rehabilitate themselves.  And  to

those who refuse to be helped, the law should come down on  them

hard.   But  I  would like to urge the Minister to  continue  to

spare  no effort in the rehabilitation of this group of  addicts

so  that  more of those who are unfortunate enough to be exposed

to  this  deadly habit would have the chance of living a  normal

life.  Because we have to face the fact that those who have been

caught  taking  drugs the third or fourth time would  have  very

little chance to be cured even when they are confronted with the

most severe punishment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have not come across many anti-drug campaigns being carried out recently. Anti-smoking and

anti-crime campaigns seem to be taking the limelight.   I  would

therefore  suggest that the Ministry carry on with  more  active

public education on the awareness of the harmful consequence  of

drug abuse.  Although the introduction of more severe punishment

of  repeated  drug addicts is a step in the right  direction  to

deter  hard-core addicts from further indulgence in this  habit,

the  most effective way to combat this social ill will still  be

deterring  the would-be drug addict from following this  vicious

cycle.  After all, prevention is always better than cure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister wants this House to

approve laws which will allow the Government to inflict corporal

punishment on repeated consumers of specified drugs.   A  second

time offender under the new section 33A can now be caned up to a

maximum of 12 strokes.  This makes repeat consuming of specified

drugs  an  offence  equivalent to the most heinous  and  violent

crimes.   Caning  is  normally reserved  for  those  who  commit

heinous  and  violent  crimes,  like  armed  robbery,  rape   or

trafficking in heroin and other illegal drugs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some countries, consumption of heroin is not even a

crime.   It  is classified a social problem.  But in  Singapore,

consumption of heroin is considered a crime.  Those  who  do  so

can be compulsorily detained for treatment and rehabilitated  up

to  a  maximum  period  of  three  years.   The  fact  that  the

Government  has to escalate the punishment from non-corporal  to

corporal   ones  for  repeat  drug  offenders  shows  that   the

Government's  treatment and rehabilitation programmes  for  drug

addicts   over  the  last  20  years  have  probably  not   been

successful.   It  is  now resorting to strong-arm  tactics.   It

virtually  wants  to impose its will on the  drug  addicts.   It

tells  the  drug addicts: Do not take heroin or other  specified

drugs  again!  If you do so, we are going to whack the  daylight

out of you!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, the majority of drug addicts will get the message and

stop their old habits of taking drugs.  But what happens

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>

if  a drug addict who is so badly addicted and he is a person of

weak  character and is unable to give up the heroin habit,  even

after the second conviction and punishment under the new section

33A?   There  is  no  mention in the Bill of further  punishment

after  that.   Does  it mean that this type of  recidivist  drug

addict  has to be locked up forever?   Perhaps the Minister  can

clarify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like the Minister perhaps to tell this House why

the  Government's  treatment and rehabilitation  programmes  for

drug addicts have not been so successful.  Is the Government not

putting enough money into the programmes?  If not, why not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to have another look at

these  treatment and rehabilitation programmes of  drug  addicts

rather than take the easy way out by caning repeat offenders  of

specified  drugs.   If  Singapore has to resort  to  caning  all

social wrong-doers, then I am afraid that Singapore can never be

a cohesive society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I speak in support of

the  Bill, there is something which I would like to bring to the

attention  of  the  House.  When the Minister  was  speaking  on

illegal  immigrants  -  I thought I heard  him  wrongly,  but  I

checked - he said Bangladeshi language.  I do not think there is

a  Bangladeshi  language.   I hope the  Ministry  officials  who

prepared  these  answers  be made aware  that  the  language  is

Bengali or Bangla.  So I do not want Hansard to have that again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I say that I disagree with the point made by Mr Chiam.

I  think  the drug pusher is the worst form of criminal that  we

can come across.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Consumers, not pushers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Consumers and pushers are the same class of

people.   I will come to that later.  I will come to Mr  Chiam's

point later because I think we have come a long way, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since  we  started  our efforts  to  curb  drug  abuse  in

Singapore in the 70s.  Many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>

critics  used to chide us for having such a stringent  law.   We

imposed  the death penalty.  We introduced mandatory  sentences.

Even  some  of  our own leaders thought that it was  too  harsh.

Sir,  we have come a long way.  But despite all the efforts,  we

have seen how drug abuse has increased not only in Singapore but

all  over  the  world.   We have in our own  newspapers  graphic

details of the suffering of these young men and women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister and his officials have responded well

by  bringing  up this legislation.  I shall not  deal  with  the

details  of  the Bill as other Members are going to speak.   But

suffice  to  say,  Sir,  for the law  to  be  effective,  it  is

important  -  and I repeat - it is important that the  community

must  play its role.  I urge every Singaporean to play his role.

If  we  have a member of the household or a friend who has  gone

astray, we must try our level best to persuade him, soft-talk to

him, if need be, refer him for professional counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of my duty in SINDA, I have visited two to

three  rehabilitation centres.  I am really impressed  with  the

dedication  with  which  these  volunteers  have  reformed   and

rehabilitated  drug  addicts.   And  that  is  why  when  I  was

listening   to   my   friend,  Mr  Kenneth   Chen's   call   for

rehabilitation,  I  thought this is an area that  not  just  the

Ministry   of  Home  Affairs  but  the  Ministry  of   Community

Development should work together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the drug abusers start with soft drugs, I think Mr

Chiam  was quite right.  I saw in a recent trip to India,  bhang

trees  growing like wild bush, and in Singapore if  you  consume

bhang,  of  course, you are going to be in trouble, but  not  in

India.   So  my  appeal is that we should try to persuade  these

young people to give up their habit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from drugs, many of them move to crime which has very close

co-relation.  If you have a profile or if you make  a  study  of

the  drug abusers, you will find most of them have some form  of

criminal  record.   It is therefore important that  our  schools

should play a more active role.  I would like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>

to  congratulate the Minister for Education, who also happens to

have  the  double role of Minister for Defence, for the valuable

work  that  his Ministry does in dealing with drug  abuse,  both

with  the regulars as well as the national servicemen.  I  think

the problem should be addressed, and here again I agree with  Mr

Chen that the campaign should start early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our location makes it vulnerable to international drug

syndicates.   We  cannot run away from this fact.   Despite  the

death penalty, people try their luck.  I would therefore like to

commend  our Home Team, the Police as well as the CNB.  In  this

regard, I wonder if the CNB could become a specialised branch of

the  Police.   In  this  way,  we  will  transfer  some  of  the

outstanding Police Officers to do some CNB duties.  The Minister

may want to study this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though unrelated to this Bill, it is important that we must

also try to win the battle against another form of abuse, and  I

am speaking of smoking.  It is very distressing to see our young

smoking.  Why do I say this, Sir?  Because for many cases,  from

smoking,  it goes to other things.  I am not saying all  smokers

end  up  in  this.  But some early smokers start and end  up  in

this.  So if we can solve this problem, it will be good for  the

community,  because I see it is just not only in  Orchard  Road,

but  also  Shenton  Way,  young  ladies  puffing  their  way  in

coffeeshops.   So  I  would urge that we should  be  very,  very

careful that we should not leave this area unattended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the new definition of "manufacture". It now

covers  transformation of one drug into another.  And I think  a

valuable  area has been taken care of and the loophole has  been

covered.   Under the new section 8A, Sir, the law on consumption

of  drugs  outside Singapore is to be welcomed.   It  is  extra-territorial.   But I think we have other legislation,  like  the

Women's Charter where bigamy is punished, whether it happens  in

Singapore  or  outside.   So  I  think  Members  should  not  be

surprised at this legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, under section 17, new drugs will come under the

control of this Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>

The  Minister  has given detailed history of  them.   I  do  not

propose to go over them.  I end, Sir, with this thought for  the

Members.   A  murderer only kills one person at a time  while  a

drug  pusher kills many.  He brings about disaster to the family

of  the drug addict, besides the drug abuser himself, and  which

we  have  no sympathy for him at all.  He is the worst  form  of

criminal.   We  should  show  our  total  abhorrence  for   this

activity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Sir,

for giving me this opportunity to speak on a topic which I think

all  of us as parents must give serious attention to because  it

can affect our teenage children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having just had the last Parliament debate on enhanced penalties

for  maid abuse, my first reaction to this Amendment Bill was  a

hesitant  one  as I questioned why we are debating  yet  another

harsh  Bill about longer jail sentences and more strokes of  the

cane  for  drug  addiction.  Have we become a  society  able  to

prevent  delinquent  behaviour only by corporal  punishment  and

incarceration and not by non-coercive means?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consulted some officers from NCADA, SANA, SCORE as well as

half-way  houses  like Taman Bacaan, New Direction  and  several

family  service centres and volunteers dealing with drug addicts

and I would like to share with this House my reflections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the recognition that this Bill is a tough love

policy.   Everyone  I  have talked to  supported  the  Bill,  in

particular  enhanced  penalties on Ice and Ecstasy  traffickers.

It  was  on  the  basis of balancing compassion  with  pragmatic

efficacy  that  drug  prevention advocates, therapists  and  ex-addicts themselves came to accept long jail sentences and caning

as  effective  deterrents  to  drug  offence.   There  was  some

sympathy,  however, for those offenders who only hurt themselves

and had no other criminal record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caning is spared for the first two convictions. In some other

countries, a first offender is in fact whipped.  The general

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>

feeling  is that there is ample warning to first-time offenders.

It  was pointed out to me by a drug prevention officer that,  in

the  past,  we  punished too little and too late.  This  lenient

approach  led to the growth of addicts from 500 in the  70s  who

were  incarcerated  on  St. John's Island to  10,000  registered

today, without counting those still in hiding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some officers who were talking to me even recommend longer

incarceration to include a longer stay at half-way  houses  from

the  current  stipulation of six months to  18  months  so  that

inmates undergo a more intensive individual and family treatment

programme in a user friendly environment away from prison cells.

At  the same time, they also learn work and social skills  which

will   enable   them  to  re-integrate  into  society.    Social

integration, Sir, and work are the best relapse control factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am persuaded to support this Bill because I believe

that implementing a harsh Bill now will send a strong message to

those  who  are experimenting with drugs for the first  time  to

quickly  seek help in order to avoid the pain of the  cane.   In

fact,  there  are  in recent weeks more volunteer  walk-ins  for

treatment because they got to know of the enhanced penalties  in

this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we accept that a harsh law cannot make the 20% of all

addicts who are hardcore, turn around and be good again, it will

deter  the  80%  who are at the early stages of experimentation.

More  important, it will be a deterrent for those who have never

tried drugs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my research, I was awakened to a reality of drug abuse

fraught with tremendous pain and coping difficulty.  The  nature

of  the drug addiction is such that we have to adopt this "tough

love"  policy  to tackle the illness square on.   A  tough  love

policy   includes   compassion  tempered   by   discipline   and

deterrents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second reflection though is the recognition of this Bill

as a limited component in the overall drug prevention programme.

The  Bill  takes  care  of keeping offenders  safely  away  from

contaminating others, but what programmes are offered

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>

during   incarceration  and  after  release  to   enable   these

offenders,  many  of  whom still young with families,  integrate

into mainstream society and lead independent lives?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that the Home Affairs Ministry has taken the

lead  to  reorganise the drug management sector by  coordinating

prevention   and  rehabilitation  programmes  in   the   various

Ministries,  detention centres and help  agencies.   The  recent

national  seminar on "Alliance Against Drug Abuse - A  Community

Approach"  was  a  case in point.  I also read  reports  on  the

advances  in  the  management of drug addiction using  medicines

like  Naltrexone and Trexan for treatment and relapses  control;

12-step  counselling method used to restore an addict's  control

over  his  impulses as well as the setting up of the  Industrial

Services  Cooperative Societies Ltd (ISCOS)  to  find  jobs  for

these addicts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are commendable programmes, Sir. I was told,

however,  that the prison curriculum adopts very much an  inmate

focus  characterised  by  chemical correction,  physical  drill,

confinement  and  rough handling.  While this  is  necessary  to

start  the  detoxification programme, the use  of  physical  and

psychological  humiliation,  Sir,  cannot  restore  dignity  and

sustain motivation towards recovery in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to the third reflection - a need to shift

focus from addressing the nature of drug addiction to the socio-psychological  context  of drug addicts and  their  families  to

identify  the  reasons  for the occurrence  of  drug  abuse  and

recurrent relapses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1995 Inter-Ministry Report on Dysfunctional Families,

Juvenile  Delinquency and Drug Abuse cited dysfunctional  family

conditions and relationships as the main cause.  The Report also

submitted a list of recommendations in tackling drug abuse which

I  hope  the various Ministries would act on.  During my contact

with  social workers during the last few weeks, I met and learnt

about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>

many  cases:  a  9  year old girl who grew up  in  a  delinquent

culture  of broken homes and poor education; a  11 year old  boy

who was jailed because he stole  a car; a 16 year old boy who is

heading  the household because both his parents are in the  drug

rehabilitation  centre (DRC); several others who  were  released

from  half-way houses but had no homes to return to because they

were  rejected by spouses and family members; a whole family  of

drug addiction because family members could not emerge from  the

culture of delinquency and hopelessness and were driven to drugs

for psychological relief; young female addicts leaving babies in

the  care  of  relatives serving their jail  terms  while  their

husbands  are  also  serving theirs; and  many  more  recovering

addicts who could no longer adjust to normal living because they

have  lost touch with friends and work environment due  to  long

incarceration.   I  could  go on and  on  with  these  tales  of

disabling families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to my fourth reflection - a need to

strengthen family support rehabilitation programmes.  We read in

the  literature that the most successful addicts-on-recovery are

those  who  are  highly motivated, employed and  are  in  stable

relationships.  Among these, the family is a crucial  pillar  of

support.  This is not the case in most of the families  of  drug

addicts.   They lack this critical support, and with  time  they

forget  the fear and the pain of caning and jail confinement  as

well.  Therefore, it is no surprise that recidivism is high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we bring the family into the rehabilitation

programmes  during  and  after incarceration?   There  are  some

suggestions from the community.  The first is support  a  family

therapy  model  by  involving the family in  the  rehabilitation

programme conducted in prisons.  Detention institutions, such as

DRCs   and  SCORE,  conduct  a  pre-release  family  counselling

programme.  Experts feel that this is too brief and too late  in

the detention.  Family counselling sessions should be instituted

right from the start during incarceration to restore a sense  of

ownership  and  family  participation so that  when  the  addict

returns home, there is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>

less  emotional adjustment.  In the long run, could the Ministry

consider  converting  some  old  HDB  blocks  to  rehabilitation

centres  whereby  families can stay together during  appropriate

treatment phases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is increased funding for half-way

institutions  from  $16  per capita  to  $25  to  allow  weekend

accommodation  of  children and family members  with  recovering

inmates.  In Taman Bacaan half-way house for women drug abusers,

family living together providing emotional support to recovering

addicts  proved  to be most effective for recovery  and  relapse

control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion is to make parents pay a small amount,

even $1 a day or 50 cents a day, to half-way houses to restore a

sense  of  responsibility towards the offenders and a  sense  of

ownership of a family problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth suggestion is to relax the electronic monitoring

system by not stipulating that offenders under probation must be

at  home  in  the  evenings, so that they can  attend  self-help

groups  or  individual counselling sessions organised by  social

service  centres  in  the  evening.  What  is  needed  is  close

supervision  to ensure behavioural compliance with curfew  times

at identified hours without sacrificing opportunities for group-work activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last suggestion is to spend money to strengthen

counselling skills for all officers dealing with addicts.  These

counselling  skills  must  include,  Sir,  an  intense  criminal

assessment  programme  to  identify  the  appropriate  treatment

schedule that will restore a sense of control in the addict  and

tap the resource of his family to create an enabling climate for

his  recovery.  The plans for strengthening alumni  support  and

setting  up  Narcotics  Anonymous for  after-care  recovery  are

commendable efforts which must be given priority attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to my last reflection - a need for our

realistic acceptance of an addict's capacity to lead responsible

lives.   Sir,  we  cannot hope that, with this  Bill,  the  drug

addicts, subjected to its harsh

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>

punishment, will "turn over a new leaf".  Not many of them  will

become  "robust" again who are able to pick up their pieces  and

move  on  like any normal Singaporean.  The journey is hazardous

and  an  uphill  one,  thwarted by factors from  psychogenic  to

familial  and socio-structural ones, including gang  and  secret

society  influence from drug syndicates which are ever ready  to

tempt  them  once again.  I personally learnt of a case  when  a

peddler  was at the family's door-steps on the very day  of  the

release of a drug addict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addicts will be in and out of DRCs and half-way houses

because  they  simply lack the skills in taking responsibilities

for  their  actions.  The crippling family factors do  not  just

vanish  while they are in jail, Sir.  After some years of normal

living,  they  feel  lonely  again  and  become  re-addicted  by

succumbing to peer group pressures.  By contextualising the drug

addicts   in   the  larger  picture  of  a  delinquent   culture

characterised  by low education, low self-esteem,  poor  problem

solving  skills, inadequate parenting and limited resources,  we

have  to  accept that the solutions to drug offence  which  this

Bill  sets out to address are more than what one legal tool  can

achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advocates in the sector call for the adoption of a more

tolerant  attitude  and  a  comprehensive  perspective  by   the

authorities  in meting out appropriate sentences and  developing

matching treatment models for drug addicts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tough love policy, Sir, let this Bill take care of the

tough  part,  but the rest of the prevention and  rehabilitation

agencies  must  focus  and be supported by  the  State  and  the

community on the "love" part to fit the pieces of these  damaged

lives  together  and  give them a second chance.   And  here,  I

support  Mr  Chiam's call earlier on for more  reinforcement  in

preventive   rehabilitation  programmes.   I   believe   if   we

prioritise attention and resources on developing care programmes

that  will initiate cognitive, emotional and behavioural changes

in  disabling individuals and families, in the long  run,  there

will  be no need to exercise the instruments of this Bill.  That

is my hope.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no quarrel with the

measures  taken to deal with drug traffickers and  manufacturers

of  drugs,  although I was a bit alarmed to hear  one  Nominated

Member  equating a consumer with a drug pusher.  We are  getting

new  definitions.    But I am concerned, as Mr  Chiam  has  been

concerned, with the approach taken by the Ministry towards  drug

addicts and users of drugs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think, as has been emphasised by more

than  one speaker, the consumption of drug is a social evil  and

not  to  be  categorised as a crime like crimes under the  Penal

Code  are.  My objection to the clause introducing a new section

33A  is  that it is bad on two counts.  One, it has the  blanket

approach without any regard for the particular circumstances  or

situation  of the offender.  It is just a blanket approach.   No

two cases are ever the same, Mr Speaker, Sir.  There are persons

who  suddenly find themselves caught in a situation  where  they

slip  in  a  drug and there are others who return  knowingly  to

consume  drugs.  The Minister more than once kept  referring  to

hardcore  addicts.  Who is a "hardcore addict"?  Is  a  man  who

previously  had had a conviction for using a drug -  or  perhaps

even two convictions - some years in the past and has tried very

hard  to keep off drugs and has succeeded for a good many years,

but  suddenly he finds himself caught up in a situation with his

friends, whom he least suspects, are consuming drugs and on  the

spur  of the moment, he slips into his body one of these  drugs,

by  then it is too late. Is he a hardcore addict?  Or is he just

a  victim of an  unfortunate incident?  This Bill does not  seem

to  cater  for those who might find themselves in that situation

and  who perhaps find themselves caught for having taken a  drug

unwittingly.  I know myself of such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is wrong, in the case of punishments, to treat

every case as though it is the same.  They vary, as I said, from

one  individual to another.  And related to this, of course,  it

is  bad  in principle because it tends to deprive the courts  of

their  function.   Mandatory sentences should  be  kept  to  the

minimum.  Because under the Constitution, the judicial power in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  is vested with the courts.   And judicial  power,  of

course, includes not just finding persons guilty of offences but

deciding  on the appropriate sentences that have to  be  passed.

So  this  increasing  tendency to deprive the  courts  of  their

proper function under the Constitution is to be regretted.   The

courts are placed in the best position to judge what sentence is

adequate  and necessary in the case of the offender  before  it,

not  this  House.   Because when we pass  the  Bill,  we  cannot

contemplate the myriad of situations that might arise.   We  can

only  stipulate the approach that should be taken and then leave

it  to the courts to decide on the specific sentence that should

be passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at this new section 33A, Mr Speaker, Sir, it

proposes  to  punish  not just hardcore  addicts.   I  wish  the

Minister had tried to define what he meant by "hardcore  addict"

but  people  who fail to provide a urine specimen with  enhanced

punishments.   The  Minister was singling out  persons  who  are

arrested  and  who  refuse to give their samples  of  urine  for

testing.   I  would like to know from the Minister does  it  not

also include persons who miss out perhaps once from attending at

the  police stations or CNB for their urine tests where they are

under a supervision order?  A person may miss out on one of  his

urine  tests for a great many reasons.  But if he is to be  sent

to  prison  for  five years just because he has had  a  previous

conviction  or  admission and he has failed  in  one  particular

instance  to  report for his urine test, it seems to  me  to  be

unusually  harsh  and,  may I say especially  with  the  caning,

totally  inhumane.   It does not take into account  at  all  the

situation of the person concerned.  So it is my concern that the

new  punishments violate, as I said, the principle that  no  two

offenders  are  in  the  same position  and  should  be  treated

differently  and, secondly, far more importantly, they  encroach

on the jurisdiction and function of the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that the Ministry consider a proviso to this

section,  allowing the courts to inquire into the  circumstances

which led the person to miss out on a urine test, or to take the

drug for which he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>

is  charged.   And  if  there  are special  circumstances  which

warrant  that the court should not pass the mandatory  sentence,

the  court  should  be empowered to do so.  We  have  a  similar

provision in the case of drivers who have to be disqualified for

offences  under the Road Traffic Act or for using motor vehicles

without insurance.  There the courts are given the power not  to

order  disqualification of a year or more where, in the view  of

the  court,  there  are special circumstances that  warrant  not

passing the term of disqualification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also question, as Mr Chiam has done, the need to

impose  caning?   This new sentence provides for  a  minimum  of

three strokes and also for a minimum of six strokes.  It used to

be  the law at one time that caning should only be ordered  when

the  criminal  himself  has resorted to violence.   But  we,  in

Singapore, would appear to be lashing out for every offence.   I

know this is not popular with the establishment but may I remind

the  Government that in other enlightened societies,  caning  is

strictly forbidden.  The European Court of Human Rights has held

more  than  once  that  caning degrades  the  human  being,  the

individual,  and is illegal under the Universal  Declaration  of

Human Rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been stressed by many a speaker, and particularly by

Madam  Chiang, drug taking is a social problem, not only  to  be

dealt with by just lashing out but also by taking positive steps

to  rehabilitate and to keep people off drugs.  Very  little  is

being  done,  it  would appear, on that level.  Youths  turn  to

drugs because they are bored, because they have no jobs, because

there  is  nothing  better for them to do  to  get  out  of  the

depression  in their lives except to take something  which  will

make  them high.  What is being done socially to make our  young

people  see the wrongdoing of resorting to drugs and opening  up

new  opportunities for them where they can direct their energies

and  put  them to use?  Is it a reluctance on the  part  of  the

Government  to spend a bit more money on this and  to  leave  it

entirely to private organisations?  We should like to know

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>

more  from  the Minister, as has been asked, as to what  exactly

the Government is doing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to say a

few words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to support the Bill. However, I

find  that it is interesting to listen to the views of Mr  Chiam

See  Tong,  Madam Chiang and the like, and that is to make  this

Bill  full of compassion.  I think there are sufficient agencies

in  Singapore, whether it is rehabilitation, prevention or other

social agencies, to take care of the emotional and compassionate

part of it.  Let us be very relevant and focused today.  We  are

dealing  with the misuse of drugs.  If he were to study  history

and  learn about the Opium War, then Mr Chiam would not want  to

make that kind of comment, so compassionate to the drug pushers,

traffickers  and, indeed, the recalcitrants.  We must  ask  this

question: at the end of the day, this particular Bill,  when  it

is  enacted,  would  it  serve the  purpose  of  prevention  and

deterrence?  To me, at the end of the day, it does.  We must  be

cruel to be kind.  We are dealing with a lethal weapon which  is

sufficient  enough  to  destroy the  well-being  of  a  society.

Therefore, I believe that the introduction of new section 33A is

a good section to deter people from abusing drugs.

Indeed,  I  would make a further suggestion.  There is  no  need

really  to  differentiate  a Class 1  consumer  and  a  Class  2

consumer,  ie,  those who are caught under  section  33A(1)  and

those  who  are caught under section 33A(2).  I think we  should

just  go  straight to make them suffer by giving them  not  less

than  seven  years of imprisonment, of course not more  than  13

years, and give them six to 12 strokes of caning.  In this  way,

we would be able to send a very strong message to the nation and

to  the people of Singapore: Do not even come near it.  That  is

most important and let us not take the emotional aspect of it in

dealing with this particular Bill.

Let  us  be really focused.  Let us take into consideration  the

well-being  of  the  great  majority  of  Singaporeans  and  the

progress and prosperity of Singapore into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>

consideration.  By being very friendly to the users, pushers and

traffickers, we are doing a misdeed to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me

to  speak.  Certainly, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill  has

two  main aims.  One is tackled by the Bill specifically,  which

is   deterrence,  punishment  and  prevention.   That  has  been

adequately  addressed.   But  to  lend  support  to   my   other

colleagues, which has been  mentioned earlier, I feel obliged to

stand  up  and  highlight the other point of rehabilitation  and

through  our  own  way of doing it, which is through  self-help,

religious  and  ethnic mix of organisations.   This  is  a  very

serious  problem which even the Government on its own would  not

be able to solve the problem of rehabilitation.

As  far as deterrence is  concerned, the provision for long term

prison  sentences is indeed welcome.  We should  be  harsh  with

such  an  abuse  that has wide social implications.   Many  have

become  victims  and  uncured  throughout  their  life.   Anyone

reading  this Bill would indeed be frightened, in  view  of  the

severity of the punishment.  On the one hand, we should  not  be

tempted  to take a soft stand on this issue.  On this matter,  I

therefore support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One implication of this Bill is the provision for longer

prison  sentences.  I do hope that the longer time  the  inmates

spend in prison could also be spent in rehabilitation.  In  view

of  the complexity and difficulty of rehabilitation, one nagging

problem of this issue is the high level of relapse among abusers

who undergo rehabilitation.  I have a number of suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is for more effective rehabilitation programmes. I

hope  the  rehabilitation of these inmates can start early  from

the day they are identified right to the day they are completely

recovered.    I  would  like  to ask the  Minister  whether  the

involvement of ethnic-based and religious groups can be provided

early in the rehabilitation programme even while the inmates are

in  prison.   If  this is so, I would like to ask  the  Minister

whether he would consider giving more help to these groups

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>

in  terms  of  professional assistance and help in managing  and

organising  half-way houses.  I have found through  my  work  in

SCORE that most of these religious and

ethnic-based  organisations  are indeed  very  enthusiastic  and

motivated, largely due to their evangelical work.  But they  are

usually  in  dire  need  of  financial  and  professional  help,

especially   when  the  problems  of  drug  abuse  are   usually

associated  with complex social and psychological  problems.   I

certainly know that this problem is indeed one that has occupied

many  Malay/Muslim organisations, in view of the severity and  a

number  of  problems  of Muslim addicts.  They  have  the  right

motivation  and  enthusiasm,  but  certainly  professional   and

financial help is indeed welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore also like the Minister to provide other

help  and  assistance  in terms of strengthening  the  role  and

capability  of half-way houses to deal with this aspect  of  the

problem of rehabilitation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for making their

contributions to debate this Bill.  Some no doubt  have  done  a

lot  of  serious work because, from their speeches, I know  that

they  have spent time talking to people. Some even have personal

experiences  from  people they meet.  Indeed, they  are  serious

speeches  which  I would take seriously.  There  are  also  some

speeches  which are tedious because they are just  a  rehash  of

some of the themes that I have heard in this House from time  to

time and I would try to respond to them as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the concerns of Members here can be classified

into  several areas, and let me take them one at a time.  First,

take  the  question of rehabilitation.  I think  those  who  are

involved  in  the  work of drug prevention,  rehabilitation  and

education will know that over the last few years, we have indeed

put in a lot of time, effort, money and resources in helping the

various  groups  to improve their capabilities in rehabilitating

addicts who want to recover.  Setting up of half-way houses, for

example,  was done many years ago, but in the last few years  we

have intensified this effort and the Government has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>

also  given  them funds to help these addicts and  to  help  the

management of half-way houses manage the half-way houses.

We  have  also  helped half-way houses to look for property  and

premises  where  they can build facilities for these  recovering

addicts.   Now, I believe we have 14 such half-way  houses.   In

fact,  the  capacity in some of them are not  even  full.   Some

still  have  capacity left.  Even to stay in  a  half-way  house

requires  discipline, determination and the will  power  of  the

addict  to  say, "I want to remain in the half-way house  to  be

rehabilitated."   Sometimes, despite all  the  good-heartedness,

the  love  and  the hard work put in by volunteers  in  half-way

houses, some of these volunteers do feel disheartened that these

addicts  just do not have the discipline to take the  treatment.

But  the  Government will do what it can to help them, ie,  both

these recovering addicts as well as the half-way houses.

In  terms  of financial support, I think if they can  justify  a

case  to  ask  for  more money, we will  look  at  it,  but  the

Government does not just spend money, throwing good money  after

bad  money  to  people  who do not want to change.   Ultimately,

whether  an addict wants to recover or not, must depend  on  the

person  himself  or herself.  No amount of love,  no  amount  of

harsh punishment, no amount of money we throw at him or her, can

make  a  person change if he does not want to change.   I  think

volunteers  who have seen these people will know  that  some  of

them  are  just  desperate cases.  Let me assure those  who  are

helping  in  half-way  houses and  those  who  are  involved  in

voluntary  programmes that indeed we will  continue  to  provide

assistance where necessary.

In  fact, if Members will recall, when I announced some of these

measures in this House more than a couple of years ago,  I  said

that we are going to set up a dedicated unit in SCORE (Singapore

Cooperative  and  Rehabilitative Enterprises)  to  counsel  drug

addicts.  Indeed, such a unit had been set up.  Today,  we  have

more  than  30 professional full-time counsellors.  These  full-time counsellors

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>

will  not only counsel addicts who are in prison or the DRCs  or

those  who  need assistance, but they also provide  professional

assistance  to  those half-way houses and other counsellors  who

want  additional  back-up or training.  Indeed,  I  have  always

encouraged  them to share their resources, their  expertise  and

the knowledge that they have gained in such counselling sessions

with  anyone  who is interested.  But again, sometimes  people's

patience  can  be very thin and despite the help that  we  give,

addicts  do not want to change, and volunteers simply  give  up.

If  Members recall, years ago, SANA used to have many  voluntary

counsellors.   Today, many of them have given  up  because  they

have seen how difficult it is to change a person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also mentioned in this House examples of addicts who

have  been  in and out of the DRC and prison a number of  times,

some  even  more  than a dozen times, and they have  not  learnt

their  lesson.  So why do we have an amendment like this in  our

law?   It  is for these people who just simply refuse to change.

Rather  than  letting them go to the DRC every  time  we  arrest

them,  and  then letting them out again after a few  months,  or

even  after a maximum of three years, then before long they  are

caught  again,  back to the DRC, after they  have  served  their

time,  rehabilitation in the DRC, they went out again, but  they

are  caught  time  and  again; rather  than  wasting  our  time,

resources  and CNB's professional resources on such  people,  we

have  decided  that the only way to treat these  addicts  is  to

imprison them for a long time.

When  I served this notice in 1996 that we would imprison  these

addicts  for a long time, ie, a minimum of five years  to  seven

years,  if  they are caught again the third time, many  parents,

self-help  groups and volunteers really welcomed  this  measure.

In  fact, their view was that this was long overdue and ought to

have been done much earlier.  Then we would not have a situation

as  I  have reported in this House in 1994 when we had more than

8,900 addicts in our DRCs.  Even for the addicts themselves  who

were serving in the DRCs at that time, my Director of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>

Prisons  told me then that when this announcement  was  made  in

1996,  many  of them were very worried.  They were worried  that

since they have got one record, or two records, and if they went

out  again and get caught repeatedly, they would be in for these

new  measures.  Indeed, from the statistics that  I  see  today,

there  has been an improvement in the number of first  time  and

second time drug addicts that we arrested recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take an example. In 1994, when I reported to this

House,  we  had about 8,900 addicts in our DRCs, of which  17.3%

were  first timers, that means, they were caught the first  time

and  were  in  our DRCs.  It does not mean that they  were  only

abusing  drugs for the first time they were caught.   These  are

very  different.   It just happened that they  could  have  been

using drugs for some time and finally got caught by the CNB, and

we  classify them as first timers.  Mind you, they may have been

taking  drugs for, who knows, three years, five years,  and  not

caught,  and they were lucky to get away with it.  We had  17.3%

of these first timers in 1994 in the DRCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in 1997, that number had dropped to 10.9%, and up to March

this year, that number had dropped to 10.7%.  In other words, we

now  see a decline of the first timer drug addicts in our  DRCs.

This  is despite the very rigorous enforcement actions that  the

CNB  has been taking in the last few years, the number has  been

going down.  Since 1996/1997, CNB has had Operation Dragnet  and

all  kinds of code names that they used to arrest these  people.

You  have  read them in the papers.  And this has been going  on

for  a  long time.  Despite such rigorous enforcement action  by

the  CNB,  the number of first timer addicts arrested  has  gone

down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also monitor the number of new addicts. The number of new

addicts  caught  for the first time has also  gone  down.   What

about  the second timers?  The same situation appears.  In 1994,

for  second  timers, those who were caught for  taking  drugs  a

second  time  round, they could have been after being  released,

having  been  caught  the first time, maybe undetected  for  two

years, three years, one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>

year, or six months, for who knows how long, arrested again  the

second  time, there were 17.4% of them.  But in 1997, they  were

just  about the same, 18.2%; March 1998, about the same,  18.2%.

But those who were arrested the third time or more has increased

from 66.3% to 71.1%, and this was out of an addict population in

the  DRCs of 5,500 in 1997.  In other words, the number of  drug

addicts  in  our  DRCs saw a decline from about 8,900  to  about

5,500,  and today, I am talking about May, the number  has  even

gone down further, despite rigorous CNB enforcement actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, just the announcement of the new measures has already

had  an  effect on the addicts.  Why do we cane them?   I  think

they  really  cannot learn.  Some of them just do  not  want  to

learn.   Some of them just have no will and no determination  to

learn.   So, by keeping them in the prison for a long  time,  we

will   actually  save  them  from  the  clutches  of  the   drug

traffickers.   That is one.  Secondly, we also could  save  them

from  committing  crime and be punished under other  laws.   And

thirdly, certainly they ought to be in there to reflect  and  be

rehabilitated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What rehabilitation programmes do we have for them? They

will  be treated like any other prisoners.  We rehabilitate  our

prisoners, we give them work, we give them training.  Those  who

want to study actually attend courses - you may not know that  - they  can do GCE "O" level, "N" level, "A" level, ITE,  if  they

have  the will and the interest to study.  But not many want  to

do  that because, I suppose, they just gave up their studies and

that  is why they went to do other things, like committing crime

or taking drugs.  So I think we have to be really tough in order

to  be kind to them.  And I do not think there is any other  way

to treat them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these measures succeed in bringing down the number of drug

addicts,  I  think it will serve the nation's purpose,  it  will

serve   the  community's  interest,  and  it  will  serve  their

families'  interest,  because then the  family  will  know  that

indeed  this person hopefully can be changed.  Indeed,  we  also

involve the family in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>

counselling  and  rehabilitation.   Recently,  in  fact,   Taman

Bacaan, for example, has introduced a family education programme

for  the  new addicts.  Before they are released, their  parents

are  brought in.  But, mind you, not every parent is  interested

in  his son or daughter who has taken drugs.  Some simply refuse

to  have anything to do with them; some do not want to turn  up;

maybe  some are too busy to turn up.  But SCORE, Prisons or  the

voluntary half-way houses will try to involve the parents in the

rehabilitation  efforts, wherever possible.   However,  not  all

cases are possible; some cases are just impossible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now try to deal with some of the specific comments.

Before I get into that, let me talk about campaigns.  Mr Kenneth

Chen  and  Mr  Chiam said that maybe we should have more  public

education,  more campaigns, etc.  Indeed, we have.   There  have

been  a  lot  of campaigns in recent years to inform the  public

about the drug problem.  Since I raised this problem in 1994, we

have  had  a  series of seminars, workshops,  even  concerts  to

publicise  this problem that we have.  And we had  a  seminar  a

couple  of months ago, and we have a concert against drug  abuse

at  the  end of this month.  For those people who are interested

in  helping us to publicise the message of drug abuse,  we  have

got such a concert planned.  Similarly, we have also worked with

the schools.  The CNB officers and Police officers have gone  to

the  schools  to talk about the problem and to talk to  students

who are likely to fall into the trap of being a drug addict, and

try  to  explain to them the dangers of drug abuse.   All  these

efforts have been going on and the schools have indeed been very

happy with the education programmes that CNB has worked together

with them in publicising the drug abuse message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there has also been some mis-reading of some of the new

sections  of the Bill.  For example, Mr Chiam said  that  for  a

second  timer  drug offender, he would be caught and  caned.   I

think  that  is not right.  We only catch people who  are  third

timers.   In other words, they are caught the third  time.   [Mr

Chiam See Tong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>

interjected.]  No, third time.  Let me assure him  that  -  read

this carefully - it is only for the third time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You have got section 33 for the second timer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Please read this section carefully, and

listen to me carefully.  I will come to you afterwards.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Rai asked whether CNB Narcotics Officers

should not be part of the Police Force.  I think they are  doing

a  very  good job.  There is no need to include them as part  of

the Police Force.  But they do have certain powers of the Police

officers  and  they  have the same scheme of service  as  Police

officers.  Of course, they have other kinds of allowances.   And

it  is better that in order for us to deal with this problem, we

target this specially ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Minister, I was just thinking whether there

could be a transfer of Police officers to CNB and vice versa.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, whenever necessary, and if need be. In

fact,  we  do  not  have  a  system of closed  service.   Police

officers  who are interested to become CNB officers  could  join

the  CNB or if there are certain posts that we need to fill  but

we cannot find enough officers, we will find officers from other

services.  For your information, the Director of CNB is a Police

officer, and there are also others like him in the Force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang talked about social integration and work. I

think  she  has also found out that indeed ISCOS, together  with

SCORE, do help these recovering addicts find jobs, and they have

a  section to help them look for jobs and, in fact, they do have

work  for them to keep them away from their previous company  as

far  as  possible.   But really it is up to the  individual  who

wants  to  change.  But whether we should lift  the  curfew  for

those under electronic monitoring system or not, I think we have

to consider this very carefully.  Because for some of them, they

really need a period of curfew.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>

need  to stay at home, particularly during the vulnerable  times

in  the  evenings after work, they ought to stay  at  home  with

their  family  rather than to be tempted to mix  up  again  with

their former peers, and therefore be susceptible to drugs again.

But  she  has  also made other suggestions which I will  ask  my

officials  to  look at and, if they are workable,  certainly  we

will implement them.  But we will have to discuss that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam said that we should try to define what a hard-core

addict  is.   But  I do not know what he was doing  when  I  was

explaining what a hard-core addict is.  I suppose he can do that

by reading the Bill later on if he has the time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Tell us again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> All Members here know. I do not think I need

to  repeat what I have said earlier.  If he refuses or  did  not

want to listen or was sleeping earlier on, I see no reason why I

should waste everybody's time repeating what I have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also asked about a case of a person under a

supervision  order  and was required to  report  at  the  police

station,  but did not turn up at the police station and  whether

he  was  deemed to have refused to provide a urine specimen.   I

think  if he had listened to my speech, he would know that  that

is  not the person I am referring to.  When I said that a person

refuses  to  provide a urine specimen, I meant that when  he  is

required  to do so, ie, when he was asked to produce  his  urine

sample,  the person says, "I don't want to."  Then he  would  be

subject to that regime.  [Mr Jeyaretnam interjected.]  If he had

listened to me and read the Bill carefully, he would not ask  me

the silly question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I ask Mr Jeyaretnam to direct his

questions to the Chair?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, Sir, may I ask by way of clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wong, are you giving way?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Under a supervision order, is the man not

required to turn up and give his urine, and he fails to turn up?

So, what distinction are you making in this section?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If a person, who is required under a

supervision order to turn up to give urine sample, fails to turn

up,  he  will  be  an  absconder.  He will  be  arrested  as  an

absconder.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is he caught under this section?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I did not say that. If he had listened to me

carefully, he would not be asking me this question.  So, that is

why I said that some people do serious research work before they

come  to  the House; some people just look at the Bill and  then

ask  questions without really taking the time to understand what

the law is really all about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli asked about the rehabilitation for his people who

are in long term imprisonment.  I said that they will be treated

like  any  other prisoners and be rehabilitated like  any  other

prisoners.  For the self-help groups that need additional  help,

professional  assistance, etc, we will try  to  extend  to  them

whatever assistance that can be justifiably made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, which I forgot to mention, is about Mr

Jeyaretnam's   earlier  example  on  section  33A,   in   making

distinction between people who were caught a third time  because

they  could  have been unwittingly taking drugs the second  time

and  therefore caught under this section.  It is very  difficult

really  for  the law to make a distinction for different  people

with different circumstances.  I think in this instance, we  are

very  clear.  Anyone with a first drug record is a first  timer.

Anyone with a second drug record is a second timer.  And if that

person is caught a third time, he is a third timer.  In fact, if

you  ask  them  why they took drugs the first time,  the  second

time, and the third time, each of them will give you a different

grandmother's story.  And I think it is very difficult for us to

go   and  ascertain  the  veracity  or  truthfulness  of   their

grandmother's story.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of a clarification? The

Minister quite rightly says it is very difficult for us, meaning

the  Ministry.  I  take it, or this House, to decide  whether  a

person is a hard-core addict or not.  We can only go on standard

definitions.   But  would he not agree that if  the  courts  are

given the power to inquire, they can make the inquiry, they  can

call   for   a  report,  and  then  decide  on  the  appropriate

punishment?  Would the Minister at least concede that the courts

have the power and can do it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the courts will decide based on

what is in the law.  The law is made in Parliament, and what  is

proposed  in  the  Bill is a matter of Government  policy.   The

Government  has  decided that this be the  policy  for  treating

hardcore  addicts and it will be written down  in  the  law  and

passed  in this House, and the court will interpret it according

to  the  law.  I do not think I need to explain in great  detail

how the Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive really work

because I think Members ought to know.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Just a point of clarification.

I  agree  with  the Minister that we do not need to  spend  more

money and resources on hardcore addicts, and he was right to say

that  unless they are willing to change, no amount  of  love  or

harsh  penalties will change them.  I am merely urging for  more

focused attention on first-time offenders and I think we need to

look  at  best  practices and treatment models  to  rehabilitate

them.  I would like to inform Members of this House that the New

Direction, for example, one of the half-way houses, is run by ex-drug  addicts.  Four of the directors are doing incredibly  good

work   and   that  is  the  testimony  to  early  rehabilitation

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the electronic monitoring system, I agree with the Minister

that  they need to stay at home but some of the social  workers,

in  doing  counselling  work, find it difficult  to  reach  them

because  they cannot come out at night and a lot of the  classes

and  counselling sessions are in the evenings.  I think it is  a

matter  of  administration.  We can  monitor  them.   But,  Sir,

please consider that during that period

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>

when  they have to spend time with their family, it is also  the

period  when they need early counselling sessions.  The Ministry

should see how they could respond to both needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if it is practical to really allow

a  recovering addict who is on the electronic monitoring  system

to  be out of the home for counselling session, then I would ask

my officials to consider that.  For rehabilitating first timers,

indeed, I think that is a point which we recognise, and that  is

the  effort  and  focus of attention put in  by  our  after-care

personnel, volunteers, professional counsellors in the  DRCs  as

well  as in SCORE.  We hope that these first timers, people  who

are  caught  the first time and went to DRCs, will change  after

being caught the first time, and that is why we have spent a lot

of  time  trying to talk them out of it and not  be  caught  the

second  time.  So I think the emphasis is correct  and  we  will

spend our resources on these people who want to change, and  who

can be changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to signification of

support  by  at  least  one Member.  Does the  motion  have  the

support of any other hon. Member?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House resolves that a Commission of Inquiry be

appointed with the following terms of reference: (i) to  inquire

into  the  current  methods of investigation of  crimes  by  law

enforcement agencies particularly in the recording of statements

from  persons arrested on suspicion of having committed  crimes;

(ii)  to  inquire whether the law, as contained in the  Criminal

Procedure  Code and the Evidence Act governing criminal  trials,

adequately safeguard persons from being convicted of  crimes  of

which  they  may be innocent; and (iii) if the Commission  finds

that the methods of investigation and the provisions of the  law

do  not  sufficiently  protect innocent  persons,  what  changes

should  be  made in the law to ensure that only the  guilty  are

punished  and the innocent are not put to risk of being punished

for crimes they have not committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I start speaking on this motion, may I say

that,  in the course of my speech, I shall of course be  drawing

on  my practice at the criminal bar and in the cases that I have

done.   But  may  I  assure the House that I have  no  pecuniary

interest in this motion.  The cases have all been dealt with and

my  interest is purely one of seeing that justice is meted  out,

as  it should be, to our citizens, particularly in the field  of

criminal  justice.  Sir, if you feel that I should not  vote  on

this  at  the end of the motion, perhaps you would let me  know,

but I have no pecuniary interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I make no apology for troubling this House with this

motion  in  the  midst  of the economic woes  that  Members  are

perhaps more concerned with.  But as has been pointed out,  part

of the economic woes stems from the lack of accountability, lack

of  justice  in  the  system, lack of transparency.   Therefore,

justice is important.  In fact, I would say that the first  duty

of  any  government is to provide justice to all  its  citizens.

And  it  is  not  just  criminal justice,  of  course,  economic

justice, social justice, but criminal justice forms an important

part of it.  Because in the way criminal justice is administered

will  largely  depend on the stability of the society.   If  the

society begins to have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>

doubts  and  to lose confidence in the way criminal  justice  is

administered,  then  society will suffer  and  it  may  lead  to

instability  in the society.  So I make no apology, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that the aim of criminal justice is two-fold.

One  is  to  see that the guilty in the society, the wrongdoers,

are  brought  to  justice and punished.   That is  an  important

duty.   But  equally important, and some may rate it  even  more

important, the duty of society must be to see that those who are

innocent,  those  who  are not guilty of any  misdoing,  of  any

crime, do not suffer punishment unfairly or unnecessarily.  That

is  important.    And the importance of this has  been  stressed

time and time again, and I do not wish to remind Members of  the

pronouncements from the courts, not only in this country but  in

the  other countries, of the need to protect the innocent.   And

criminal justice, Mr Speaker, Sir, is not to be confined to just

how  the courts deal with the offenders, persons who are brought

before  it.   The greater part of criminal justice is  concerned

with the investigation, the inquiries, that are conducted by the

police  and  the  enforcement agencies before  the  persons  are

brought  to  court to be charged with offences.   And  this  was

stressed  in  a  report in the United Kingdom in 1993  when  the

government  appointed a  Royal Commission on  Criminal  Justice,

following an outcry that several persons had been convicted  and

sentenced to serve terms in prison when they were later found to

be  totally  innocent.  May I quote from  this  report?   It  is

Command 2263 submitted in 1993.  I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The protection of suspects from unfair or unreasonable

pressure is as important to the criminal justice system  as  the

thoroughness   with   which   the   police   carry   out   their

investigations.'



So the Commissioners were stressing the importance of protecting

the  suspects  and  those  who  are  innocent  from  unfair   or

unreasonable pressure in any investigation into crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in any society where the rule of law

obtains, no innocent person should fear that he or she may  find

himself or herself convicted of some offence or crime.  That  is

important, that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>

every  person  should  live with that  conviction  and  to  that

extent,  legislatures have enacted laws to protect  subjects  to

ensure  that  only the guilty are punished and the innocent  are

not  punished.  The tragedy is that it is always  the  weak  who

suffer  if these laws do not protect them.  It is the weak,  the

uneducated, the illiterate, who stand in greater danger of being

convicted even though they may be innocent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose, very briefly, to examine what the law in

Singapore  is, to provide this protection to our people.   First

of  all, the police powers of arrest.  Under the law, the police

may arrest anyone without a warrant when they have committed  an

offence or there is credible information or reasonable suspicion

of  them  having committed an offence of which report  has  been

made.   But  the  police do not always act strictly  under  this

section.  We heard earlier in the debate about drug addicts  and

the incidence of crime among drug addicts.  So they are a likely

source for the police, and this was, of course, highlighted by a

Queen's  Counsel  in  England who wrote  on  the  targetting  of

criminals.  The police pick up who they think are persons likely

to  have committed the offence without bothering too much  about

whether the information or the complaint is reasonable for  them

to act upon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of police custody. Once a

person is picked up and is taken into police custody, there  is,

under  the  Constitution, a maximum limit of 48 hours  that  the

police  may hold anyone in custody before they produce  them  in

the  courts.  But, unfortunately, this protection of  not  being

kept  in  police custody too long is eroded by the readiness  of

the  courts to grant such custody almost as soon as it is asked.

So  we have cases where the police put a holding charge, as they

call it, produce the man in court and say, "We want more time to

investigate.  May we have a week's custody?"  The courts,  as  I

say,  grant this custody without inquiring too much into whether

that custody is necessary or not.  This length of police custody

can  continue  sometimes with weekly remands for  six  weeks  or

more,  and I shall illustrate from a case to which I shall refer

at some length.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>

During this police custody, the police deny, until they say they

have  finished their investigations, any visits from any  family

members to see the person who has been arrested, ie, to see  the

suspect  and  to see whether he needs to be helped in  any  way.

This denial can again stretch to three weeks in some cases,  and

has  stretched  to  three  weeks, despite  the  Article  in  the

Constitution which says that any person who is arrested shall be

informed  of  his  charge against him and shall  be  allowed  to

consult a lawyer of his choice as soon as possible.  The courts,

way  back in 1983, I think, held that that meant that the police

could  withhold  visit from counsel or consultation  until  they

have closed their investigations.  As I said, investigations can

stretch  for up to six weeks. During all that time, the  man  is

denied  any right of consultation with his lawyer and is  denied

any family visit.  He is totally at the mercy of the police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the questioning of suspects in police custody.

There were at one time certain rules about police questioning of

persons.   They were taken from the Judges Rules in Britain  and

made  a  part of the Criminal Procedure Code, but that  has  all

been swept away.  So there are no guidelines and no restrictions

on  the  length of questioning of suspects by the police and  to

the conditions under which the questioning may be carried out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the law about the recording of statements from accused

persons.   The  law at one time was that no confession  made  by

anyone  in  police custody was admissible in any  court  of  law

unless  that confession was made before a magistrate.  That  was

swept  away.   The position now is that statements made  to  any

officer  of  the  police of the rank of Sergeant  and  above  is

admissible  provided  the  court  thinks  that  no  pressure  or

inducement has been applied.  I will illustrate this when I come

to the case that I have in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another section of the Criminal Procedure Code which

requires  the police to notify a person when they have  made  up

their  mind to charge him, to read the charge to him and to  ask

him what he has to say in reply to the charge.  The intention of

the legislature was that this should be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>

done  the moment the police make up their mind to charge anyone.

Of course, it must follow that if the police arrests anyone they

must  have  made up their mind to charge that person.   But  the

section  is  more honoured in the breach than in its observance.

The  man is not informed of his offence until maybe two or three

days  later  when  he  is  charged under  section  122(6)  which

requires  the  police  to  serve  the  notice  and  record   his

statement.  So while we have these laws, the question is how far

are   they  observed  by  the  police  in  carrying  out   their

investigations into crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I should turn to this case that I said that I would refer to

which  illustrates more than anything else what I have attempted

to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the morning of 2nd February 1989, a

caretaker  was found murdered in a coffeeshop.  The police  were

called  in  when the body was discovered.  Their first  line  of

inquiry, as I have said, was about drug addicts who lived in the

neighbourhood and who might have been seen near the shop  before

the   date  of  the  murder.   So  a  number  of  suspects  were

questioned.  May I say in passing that this is one of the things

that  perhaps makes drug addicts who have tried to come  out  of

their  addiction  feel that society would  never  forgive  them,

would  not forget them, and they are the first targets  for  any

offence suspected by the police.  So the police arrested one man

about  10  days later  and may I say, at the outset, that  there

was  no  question  that these men, who were eventually  charged,

were  totally  innocent. They were not even  anywhere  near  the

scene of crime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police arrested this man and after a whole day of

questioning, he decided to, in his own words, admit to what  the

police  wanted him to admit because "he could not  take  it  any

more."   I am not going to go through the treatment accorded  to

everyone.   I will go through the treatment accorded to  one  of

them.  So towards the evening he decided he could not take it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>

anymore and owned up to a minimal involvement of himself in  the

offence  of  murder, claiming that he was really outside  whilst

others  went in.  Of course, once he admitted to an involvement,

he  had  to  name  others,  and he gave  the  nicknames  of  two

brothers.   The two brothers were then later picked up  in  turn

and  they, after several hours of questioning under pain,  again

decided that they should go along with the police and admit what

the police were asking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the fourth man was arrested. On 18th February 1989, he

was picked up at 6.00 am.  His evidence given at the trial is  a

story  that  many may ask, "How could this happen in Singapore?"

But  he says it did happen to him.  He was picked up before 6.00

am  and taken straight to the CID without even being allowed  to

have  a drink of water or to do his morning ablutions.  Then  he

was  taken  into the Inspector's room, the officer  who  was  in

charge  of investigations, and he was handcuffed to a chair  and

later  stripped to his underpants.  All along he was  not  given

anything  to  eat or drink, he said.  They kept telling  him  to

admit  that he had been involved in the murder of the  caretaker

at  the  coffeeshop.  He kept denying, saying he  did  not  know

anything about it.  Then at 2.00 o'clock, he told the court that

the police officers who were questioning him decided they had to

be  more drastic and they made him stand on a chair stripped, as

I  said,  to his underpants, and facing the air-conditioner  and

balancing  two  to three telephone directories  on  outstretched

arms.  May I repeat, he had not been given anything to drink  or

eat from the time of his arrest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This went on, Mr Speaker, Sir, according to his evidence in

court,  till 6.00 am the next morning.  That is almost 24  hours

after  he  was picked up.  All during the 24 hours, his evidence

was  that  the  officers were sitting there,  tapping  him  with

rulers,  assaulting him and saying, "So you are going  to  be  a

hero,  let's see how long you are going to last."  He said  that

when  it came to day break, he could not stand any more of this.

In  his  own words, he told the court, "I had no food.  I  could

feel  the  chill to my bones, Sir.  I felt as if I was about  to

fall unconscious or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>

even to die."  So he decided that there was nothing he could do,

except to admit to some involvement.  So he was kept in custody,

produced in court, and remanded further in police custody  until

further  investigations were completed.  And  that,  of  course,

meant taking more and more statements from these four persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not allowed any consultation with the lawyer until about

two  or  three weeks later.  And even then, when the lawyer  was

allowed to see him, the investigating officer sat by the side of

the  lawyer  and the accused was right in front of him  and,  of

course, the accused could not say anything.  He said he was much

too  frightened.  He was not allowed any family visits until 8th

March.   These  men  were  held in  police  custody,  for  weeks

remanded,  every  time they were produced in court  until  about

27th March, and during this time the Police built up their case.

As  the  men said, they had to lie, and so they made up stories.

They made up stories about having thrown the man's wallet or the

screw  driver which was used in the offence.  But none of  these

was found, even when the Police went looking for these.  So they

found  no corroborative evidence.  The Police then decided  that

they had to get some evidence against these men and they decided

to  reduce the charge against one man to house-breaking and  get

him to give evidence against the other three.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they were remanded at Queenstown Remand Prison on 27th

March,  almost six weeks after they were picked up, the  lawyers

for  one  of  them  wrote  to the investigating  officer  giving

information  that  his client had been told by  a  man  who  was

serving  a  prison term in Changi (the name was mentioned)  that

somebody, other than the four, had committed the murder and  who

had  admitted  to it.  This letter was sent to the investigating

officer by the lawyers but the lawyers never got any reply  from

the  investigating  officer.  In court, he  said,  yes,  he  did

receive  the letter but it was not in his file.  He  thought  he

had mislaid it.  And when he was asked whether he followed up on

that information, he said, "I tried to follow it up, but nothing

was forthcoming.  And so I left it."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that the Police were

unable  to find any evidence at all from any source outside  the

statements  alleged to have been made by these four men.   There

was  no corroborative evidence of one single fact.  All that the

Police  had were these alleged statements of these four  persons

relating, according to the Police, their involvement.  The men's

explanation  was  they went along with the  Police  because  the

Police  told  them, "This is how it should have been  done,  you

know.  We know you must have got this, you must have done that."

And so they said they went along with whatever the Police said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were fingerprints found at the scene but none of the

fingerprints of any of the four matched any fingerprint found at

the scene.  There was blood found but again none of the blood of

the  four matched the blood grouping of the blood that was found

at  the  scene.  So, as I said, there was nothing against  these

men, except their so-called confessions.  At the trial, the  man

who had done a deal with the Police gave evidence, saying how he

was  just outside while the three others went in and he saw them

all  come out through the open door at the front.  But in cross-examination,  he  told  the court, "I only  admitted  because  I

couldn't  take  it any more.  I decided that I  should  just  go

along   with   what  the  Police  were  asking   me   to   say."

Nevertheless,  his  evidence was accepted  and  the  court  also

admitted  the statement from one accused.  And this is important

-   the  court  admitted  the  statement  as  having  been  made

voluntarily because that was what the Police evidence was.  They

went  into the witness box - Police officer after Police officer

and  swore that there was nothing unusual in what they did, that

the  men voluntarily made the statements.  And so the court left

with that evidence admitted - the statement of one of these  men

who  implicated the others and also the statement of  one  other

accused person.  At the end of the prosecution case, two of them

were called to enter their defence to a charge of murder.  May I

repeat  - to a murder that they had never committed.  Because  I

shall show that it was proved conclusively that they could never

have committed that murder.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was during the conduct of the defence that the defence

insisted  on calling the man of whom information had been  given

that  he  had committed the murder.  He was called  and  he,  of

course,  denied it.  But the defence also called the man serving

sentence  in  Changi Prison and he told the court that  the  man

against  whom  information had been  given  had  admitted  at  a

gathering  that he was the man who had gone into  the  shop  and

then  committed the murder.  The defence then gave  notice  that

they  would recall the fingerprint examiner, to ask whether  the

fingerprint of the man against whom information had  been  given

had  been matched with the fingerprint found at the scene.   The

DPP  then  directed the fingerprint examiner to do a comparison.

And  when  the fingerprint examiner gave evidence, he came  with

the  news which confirmed what the defence had been saying, that

a  fingerprint found at the scene matched the fingerprint of the

man against whom information had been given by the defence.  And

so  the next day, the DPP withdrew the charges against all three

men.  That was an admission, Mr Speaker, Sir, that they were the

wrong  men.   They were completely the wrong men  but  they  had

spent 39 months in prison before they could be acquitted on  the

murder  that  they  had never committed.   There  were  so  many

factors  which  militated  against  them  having  committed  the

offence but the Investigation Officer decided that once  he  had

got the confessions, that was it.  There was no need to look  at

anything more.  There is one compelling factor and that was  the

door, the opened door, they said they had come out through.  But

evidence  was given that the door could not be shut and  secured

from  outside and the morning when the body was discovered,  the

doors  were  all  found secured from inside.  So  how  did  that

happen?  The inspector would appear to have been not interested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the acquittal of these men, the Police then finally

charged the man against whom information was given.  And he  was

subsequently  tried  in another court and  he  admitted  in  his

evidence that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>

he  alone had entered the shop.  There was somebody else outside

but  not any one of these four men who had been earlier charged.

And  he was found guilty of murder and convicted.  So we had  it

proved  conclusively without any shadow of doubt that these  men

were completely innocent of the charge of murder.  And yet as  I

said,  the Police proceeded with the prosecution simply  because

they  had,  in their own words, "got the confessions from  these

men", and that was it, there is nothing more to be said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the acquittal, the men brought an action for damages in

the High Court for malicious prosecution.  This was dismissed by

the  Judicial Commissioner who held that the Police officer  had

reasonable grounds at that time for believing that these men had

committed the crime.  He avoided answering the question  whether

the  confessions were free and voluntarily made.   He  was  told

that  there were only three explanations possible.  One was that

the  men  were extroverts who suddenly decided they wanted  some

publicity,  to  be  charged with murder, and that  is  why  they

confessed.   Secondly, that their minds were  so  deranged  that

they  saw  in their minds them committing the murder.   And  the

third  explanation,  of course, was that  the  confessions  were

forced  out  of  them.  The Judicial Commissioner  unfortunately

failed to deal with this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry if I have taken so long, but this case

illustrates  so  vividly, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  total  lack  of

protection that our citizens, and I repeat again, the weak,  the

illiterate, uneducated citizens, have against Police action.  We

have to ensure that our people are protected against the Police,

that  they  are  not unnecessarily made to suffer for  something

which  they did not do.  It is not just this case of these  four

men, glaring as it is, but there are other instances, and one of

them  has  been  mentioned earlier.  There was the educationally

subnormal  boy of 12 who was picked up just because  the  Police

thought  he  was  riding a stolen bicycle and he was  questioned

without any of his parents being present or called and, when  he

left, there were marks of violence found on him.  There was  yet

another case of some foreign workers who were charged with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>

robbery.  Again, there was no evidence, apart from their alleged

confessions,  but, fortunately, the DPP could see  that  and  he

decided  to withdraw the charges, but again, after the  men  had

spent about four to six weeks in custody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was puzzled by a statement made by a CID official commenting

on  the report that a statement made to the Singapore Police  by

an  SIA steward was held inadmissible by an American court.   It

refused  to  admit that statement, saying it had not  been  made

under,  what  the Americans call, the due process of  law.   But

what  puzzled me was the statement by the CID official that  was

reported in the papers, and he said, "We have no vested interest

in  this case.  This case happened in the United States.  So why

should we force any man to confess?"  The Party queried this and

asked whether it was a Freudian slip, whether the CID was saying

because  it  was an offence committed in America,  they  had  no

vested  interest, but they would have had a vested  interest  if

the offence had been committed in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do say it quite

seriously, that we should examine the whole question of criminal

justice  in Singapore to see whether we have now gone overboard,

too  far, in our eagerness to show how good the Singapore Police

are  in combating crime so that we have good statistical figures

to publish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a debate, Mr Speaker, Sir, in this House, in 1995 and,

of  course, I was not here then.  There was this question  about

how   the   Police   went   about  investigating   crime.    The

Parliamentary Secretary, speaking in that debate, told the House

that between the years 1993 and April 1995, 166 cases were tried

in  the  High Court at which statements made to the Police  were

tendered as evidence against the accused persons, and he went on

to  say  that  only  in four, the courts refused  to  admit  the

statements  and  that,  for the rest, the  statements  were  all

admitted.   As  I said, at this trial that I have  referred  to,

statements  were  admitted.   And,  yet,  we  know  that   those

statements were all lies told by innocent men who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>

were  desperate,  anxious to escape from  the  clutches  of  the

Police.   So  the question we have to ask is: do  our  laws  now

protect our citizens from resorting to lies in the hands of  the

Police  only to escape from Police custody?  Do our laws  ensure

that   the   Police  observe  the  law  in  carrying   out   the

investigations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I again refer to this report of the United Kingdom Law

Commission on Justice.  Even before 1993, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

practice  in  the  United Kingdom was for all statements  to  be

audio  taped.   The  Police  had to audio  tape  all  statements

recorded from suspects.  But the Commission recommended that  it

was  not just audio taping but they wanted a video recording  of

all   detention  centres  where  suspects  were   detained   for

questioning, and they also referred to the right of the  suspect

to  consult  his  lawyer before he made  any  statement  to  the

Police.  And this is now the law in England under section 58  of

the  Criminal  Evidence Act, 1984, which  assures  all  arrested

persons the right to legal advice, free of charge, regardless of

their  means.  And what is more important, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

section goes on to say that if the suspect does not wish to seek

legal advice, the Police had to get that in writing from him  so

that it can be produced in court that he refused legal advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present laws in Singapore relating to admissibility of

statements  in the Criminal Procedure Code allow the prosecution

to  tender statements made to any police officer above the  rank

of  Sergeant and for it to be disallowed only if it  appears  to

the court that the statements were obtained under inducement  or

threat.   But  as  can be seen from the figures  quoted  by  the

Parliamentary Secretary then in the debate in 1995,  the  courts

admit  almost all the statements.  The courts find it  difficult

to believe that police officers would resort to the conduct that

these men say they were subjected to.  And the unfortunate  part

of  it  is that the man who is in custody has no way of  proving

his case apart from giving evidence himself.  He cannot call any

witnesses.  He has not got anybody who will advise him,  whereas

the Police of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>

course have all the officers parading into the court and saying,

"Oh,  no.  We never touched him.  It is all voluntary.  He acted

of  his own accord in giving the statement."  I think it is time

that  we looked at these sections in the Criminal Procedure Code

and see whether, as I said earlier, we have not gone too far  in

our eagerness to stamp out crime as it were.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, other laws that perhaps we should look at.

There are the sections in the Evidence Act and other sections in

the  CPC.  There is one section in the Evidence Act, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that perhaps we should look at very seriously and that  is

the section which allows the courts to act on the statement of a

co-accused without any corroboration of his evidence.   The  law

at one time was that that section meant that the courts may look

at  statements made by the co-accused.  But the courts must find

corroborative evidence of the statement made by the  co-accused.

That  law  was changed by a ruling of the Court of  Appeal  some

time  ago  and now the courts are free to convict on  statements

made   by   the  co-accused  person  even  when  there   is   no

corroboration whatsoever of his statement made to the Police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have said enough, Mr Speaker, Sir. It is important

that  we should ensure in our society, if we are concerned about

justice,  that justice is something that matters.  We should  do

something  to see, as in other countries, that innocent  persons

are  in  no danger of being convicted wrongly.  I am not  asking

this  House to make any finding on this, but my motion is simply

that  we  should now appoint a Commission, as they  did  in  the

United   Kingdom,  to  look  at  the  whole  state  of  criminal

investigation in this country.  May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

my  fears are not just my own.  A number of lawyers who practise

at the criminal bar have voiced these fears.  There used to be a

rule, it is still the rule, that an accused person is deemed  to

be  innocent  until he is proved guilty.  But some  lawyers  now

feel  that that is being eroded.  There is a view that a person,

once he is charged by the Police, must be guilty, otherwise the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>

Police  would not charge him.  That is a dangerous view to  take

and we have got to put an end to that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move that this House seriously consider this

motion  and  appoint  a Commission of Inquiry  to  inquire  into

criminal justice in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr

Jeyaretnam,  in  moving  this  motion  and  in  calling  for   a

Commission of Inquiry into the investigation of crimes  and  the

laws  relating  to criminal evidence and procedure,  has  raised

very  grave  allegations that our laws and officers of  the  law

have  somehow  not  provided  adequate  protection  for  accused

persons  and,  more  seriously,  that  the  innocent  may   have

therefore  been  unjustly punished.  As I do not  have  personal

knowledge of the cases that he referred to, I shall not speak on

those cases, but I should like to address the issue whether  the

law  relating  to criminal procedure and evidence do  adequately

protect accused persons from the risk of wrongful conviction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House should roundly and unequivocally reject such

allegations,  because if these allegations are unrebutted,  they

would  adversely affect public opinion of our administration  of

criminal  justice.   That would be most damaging  to  our  legal

system,  a  legal system that has won the respect of  many  both

inside and outside of Singapore, one that is fair, efficient and

just.  So such assertions cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Mr Jeyaretnam is aware that the general

principles of our criminal evidence were derived from the common

law  that still applies to Singapore.  Our system provides rules

and  as  much as other legal systems based on the Anglo-American

systems.  Our Evidence Act, for example, was enacted more than a

century ago in 1893.  The rules were based on the English common

law,  codified  for us for the first time in  India;  later,  in

other  jurisdictions  such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan,  the  Malayan

Federation and, of course, Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sound fundamental principles embodied in these rules.

What are they?  The first is the so-called golden thread of  the

common  law.  The prosecution, in general, shoulders the  burden

of  proof,  to prove that the accused is liable for the  offence

with  which  he  is charged.  The standard of  proof  is  beyond

reasonable   doubt.   This  is  the  so-called  presumption   of

innocence.  It is alive and well in Singapore.  The accused will

therefore be entitled to call the prosecution to prove the  case

against  him,   and  this  remains  the  fundamental  principle.

Applying  that principle and on matters which Mr Jeyaretnam  has

referred  to  in relation to the statements out  of  court,  the

accused  person's  statements are  not  admissible,  as  he  had

mentioned  just now, if they were obtained through  the  use  of

inducements,  threats or promises made by persons in  authority.

In  other  words,  involuntary  statements  or  confessions  are

inadmissible in evidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the facts that he had described just now of a case that

actually resulted in an acquittal, he would know, I think,  that

such statements may be challenged in court, and that the accused

can give evidence in voir dire to show that such confessions are

unlawfully obtained.  Indeed, in our courts, they have  extended

the  law  beyond that which Mr Jeyaretnam has referred  to.   In

other  words,  they  have  extended the law  beyond  involuntary

statements, to include what in common law is called the doctrine

of  oppression.   This is a doctrine which is familiar  both  in

England,  the  United  States,  Malaysia   and  Singapore.   The

doctrine  of oppression does not require any inducement,  threat

or  promise  if  the  accused, for any reason,  gave  statements

obtained through the use of oppressive conduct by the persons in

authority, such statements are inadmissible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our courts, we have had instances where statements have been

rejected  by reasons of either inducement, threat or promise  or

by reason of oppressive conduct.  So the courts are aware of the

possibility that statements may have been involuntarily obtained

and  these laws provide protection for any accused person coming

before the courts.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the other principles that Mr Jeyaretnam perhaps has not

mentioned?  We can refer to the principle that the accused's own

bad  reputation  or disposition to crime, for  example,  is  not

admissible  evidence against him, unless he somehow  lowers  his

shield, attacks the character of prosecution witnesses intending

to  discredit  them.  Under our existing law,  for  example,  an

accused charged for rape or molestation would be able to  attack

the  character of the victim freely without fear  that  his  own

discreditable record may be introduced in evidence.   These  are

the  checks which are put into our Evidence Act and they  remain

laws to this day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, one overriding principle that we have in our courts

today  is  that the judges have a discretion to exclude evidence

that  is  unduly prejudicial to the accused.   This has  been  a

discretion  that  is expressly recognised by a Court  of  Appeal

decision  in  Singapore and indeed in that particular  decision,

the  Chief Justice took pains to point out that he rejected  the

argument  by a dissenting Judge that the Evidence Act  does  not

provide for such a discretion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these principles remain in operation in our laws. They are

guarantees to the quality of evidence that the prosecution  must

provide  in  order  to secure a conviction.  In  evolving  these

rules,  it must not be forgotten that the State also has a  very

real  interest in protecting the interest of the general  public

in ensuring that victims of crimes are indeed protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the purpose of having a Commission of Inquiry to look

into  the rules of evidence and procedure that have been debated

in  this House, the latest of which was in 1976, when amendments

were  made  to  the Evidence Act and to the  Criminal  Procedure

Code  following the recommendations actually of another  English

Evidence  Committee,  ie, the 11th Report of  the  Committee  on

Criminal Evidence?  Singapore introduced those provisions and by

introducing  those provisions had actually done  away  with  the

Judge's rules which Mr Jeyaretnam is so fond of.  But in  having

taken out the Judge's rules, they have also put in place

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>

provisions  concerning the taking of statements.  I  believe  Mr

Jeyaretnam  is, as he has criminal practice, familiar  with  the

provisions  of  section  122(6), (7) and  (8)  of  the  Criminal

Procedure  Code.  All these are rules of evidence  and  criminal

procedure  that  are  debated.  There is no  need  to  have  any

Commission  of  Inquiry to decide whether such rules  take  into

account the interest of accused persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no reason for appointing a

Commission  of  Inquiry,  as suggested  by  Mr  Jeyaretnam.   Of

course, I do not mean to say here that our laws of evidence  and

procedure should not be revised from time to time, to keep  them

relevant  in the light of changing circumstances.   It  must  be

remembered  that our Evidence Act, for example,  is  enacted  in

1893.  It is over a hundred years old.  It is beginning to  show

some   signs   of   not  being  able  to  cope   with   changing

circumstances.  But there is no reason why the normal procedures

in  Parliament would not be able to take care of any issues that

may arise in such reform.  Therefore, Sir, we should reject this

motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam once

again  raises  an old issue.  We have debated these  matters  in

this  House  many  times  before about alleged  police  assault,

alleged police impropriety, especially in the last term when  Mr

Jeyaretnam  was not in the House.  And we did not  debate  these

matters in vacuo.  Many MPs, including Opposition MPs such as Mr

Low Thia Khiang, Mr Cheo Chai Chen and NMPs such as Assoc. Prof.

Walter   Woon  and  Dr  Kanwaljit  Soin  asked  many   searching

questions, both general and on specific cases.  And to all these

queries,  the  Government gave full and  detailed  explanations.

All these are in the Hansard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng, also gave a

detailed account of how our criminal justice

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>

system  operates, highlighting its safeguards, when this  House,

after a full debate in May 1995, passed a motion reaffirming the

House's  confidence  in  Singapore's  criminal  justice  system,

especially the integrity of our Judges in upholding the rule  of

law and the competence of the Police in enforcing law and order.

If  I  am not wrong, Mr Low who was in this House at that  time,

voted in favour of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why then is the Workers' Party's Secretary-General raising

this  motion  today?   Quite true to  form,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  has

strayed in his speech.  Let us just focus on the main points  of

today's motion.  Mr Jeyaretnam has told a long story, but really

the heart of the matter is that Mr Jeyaretnam wants a Commission

of  Inquiry (COI) to look into police investigation methods  and

he  has  also mentioned some legal provisions and procedures  to

see  if  they  adequately protect innocent persons.   But,  Sir,

really the first question this House must ask is: on what  basis

does  he ask for a Commission of Inquiry?  Has he or anyone else

uncovered  gross miscarriages of justice necessitating  such  an

inquiry?   Or  indeed blatant abuse of police powers  or  forced

confessions  or  other ill treatment of accused persons?   Well,

the  answer is no.  Quite predictably, he mentioned the case  of

Zainal Bin Kuning and others which he represented and which,  in

fact,  in  the past, he had already raised in this  House  in  a

previous  debate last year, when I responded to him  during  the

Committee of Supply debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have looked at the reports and all the papers. First, of

course,  Mr Jeyaretnam tells his side of the story, as recounted

to him no doubt by his client about police assault.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It was given in evidence in court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, if you wish to interject,

could you please rise and seek my permission?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am sorry, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Prof. Ho.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The point of the matter is that

there  was a suit taken by Mr Zainal in that case where  he  was

represented,  if  I  am  not wrong, by the  NCMP  for  malicious

prosecution and forced imprisonment.  But the High Court

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>

Judge in that case, after a full trial, said that looking at the

evidence  before  him,  he  found  that  there  was  no   forced

confession.  The confession was voluntary.  He looked  at  other

evidence.   He looked at the evidence of the medical doctor  who

examined  the accused person in accordance with the  requirement

of  the  law and also the evidence of the interpreter.   Indeed,

the  Court of Appeal, when it went on appeal, said that it found

no  grounds  to interfere with the findings of the  High  Court.

There, we have it, Sir, full-fledged cases which have determined

this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Mr Jeyaretnam says, "Well, the DPP, when it

dropped the charges, said that the parties were innocent."  What

happened  in  that case is, quite rightly, as Mr Jeyaretnam  has

mentioned, fresh evidence surfaced, evidence as to fingerprints,

alibi  evidence, which had been disclosed before in a letter  to

the investigation officer.  Mr Jeyaretnam is correct in that the

officer  had  not exercised enough diligence in  pursuing  those

leads and indeed the officer has been disciplined for that.  But

the  point is that there was no cover-up and no intention on the

part  of  the  police to deliberately frame anybody or  suppress

evidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Public Prosecutor preferred the charges against the

three  original  accused,  there was  evidence  given  by  their

accomplice,  who had testified that they were the ones  who  had

committed the robbery and the murder.  Of course, in the face of

the  fresh evidence, quite rightly the police in that case  said

that  they would go under section 193 of the CPC where it  asked

for  the  court's  indulgence that it did not  wish  to  further

prosecute  the accused under the charge.  That section  provides

that the accused person shall be given a discharge not amounting

to  an  acquittal,  unless  of course  the  presiding  judge  so

decides.   In  that  case, I think Mr Jeyaretnam  protested  and

asked  for  an acquittal and the court granted his  client  that

acquittal. That is the background.  I think we have to see  this

in  totality.  It is not a case of police wrongdoing.  There may

have been some areas in its investigations which could have been

more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>

diligently  pursued.  But on the facts before it,  the  DPP  had

every reason to prefer the charges and to do what it did.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the police is open enough, the DPP

is  open enough, should there be evidence to suggest that  there

is  some  doubt.  Do not forget that at the end of the day,  the

Attorney-General's  Chambers  has  to  prove  its  case   beyond

reasonable doubt, which is a high standard of proof.  Therefore,

should  there  be  evidence,  the totality  of  which  makes  it

difficult  to  succeed in proving its case,  according  to  this

standard,  it  could  very well be, as it happened  in  Zainal's

case, where the DPP says, "Well, we will go under section 193."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at that time, Mr Jeyaretnam had called for a Commission

of  Inquiry to be formed in 1992.  Now, six years later, out  of

the  blue, he calls for a Commission of Inquiry.  But he forgets

that,  in  the meantime, in these six years - in fact, the  case

took  place  in 1989, which is almost 10 years ago - there  have

been  many  improvements to our criminal  justice  system.   The

court  system,  for one thing, there is no backlog.   Therefore,

the  long  remand period that the accused persons in  that  case

were  subject  to was quite unfortunate, but he knows  that  the

courts have become more efficient.  We have also introduced laws

to  make  sure that the cases go more expeditiously.  I am  told

that  for High Court criminal cases now, it would not take  more

than  five  to six months before a person is tried  after  being

first charged in court.  There have been other improvements such

as pre-trial conferences, police team investigation systems, and

so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam cites the Runciman Commission of Inquiry in

the UK which, of course, came in the light of public outcry over

a  few  high  profile cases, "Guildford 4", "Birmingham  6"  and

other  like  cases, where innocent parties were put into  prison

for many, many years, I think more than 10 years. As a result of

external  investigations, it was found out that  police  had  in

fact  used  tainted evidence and there were other improprieties.

Then  the Commission came about which, of course, gave  rise  to

certain recommendations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>

But the question really is this: does this situation pertain  in

Singapore today?  Mr Jeyaretnam likes to pluck examples from the

UK  without really examining whether they are applicable in  the

local  context.  He talks about the Runciman Commission  and  he

talks about video taping and other examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say that in other countries, including the UK,

there  is  concern that the balance is now tilted  too  much  in

favour  of accused persons, resulting in miscarriages of justice

where guilty parties are escaping the clutches of the law.   All

over  the  world, criminals, including those in Singapore,  have

become more intelligent. What we need really is not to shift the

balance,  as  it  applies today, more in  their  favour,  as  Mr

Jeyaretnam  suggests, because then we are doing a disservice  to

the  preponderant majority of innocent Singaporeans who  deserve

our every protection. Let us not do as Mr Jeyaretnam urges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. When the public prosecutor drops a

charge, it does not necessarily mean that the accused person  is

innocent.   Indeed, if the court finds that the charge  has  not

been  made  out, it does not  necessarily mean that the  accused

person  is  innocent. What it means is that the prosecution  has

failed  to  discharge the high burden of proof beyond reasonable

doubt.   To  put  it  in another way, the  defence  has  cast  a

reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.  This point  was  in

fact  covered by the Minister for Law in this House in  response

to  Prof. Walter Woon that we should not get carried away.  Yes,

there are cases where the public prosecutor does not succeed  in

proving  its case and therefore convicting the accused,  but  it

does  not  mean therefore that the charge should not  have  been

preferred  in  the first place, because the AG's  Chambers  must

decide in the public interest what cases to prosecute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of Members, let me just recount what we

already  have in our system, where there are adequate safeguards

to ensure that innocent people are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>

not  convicted.  For example, the investigation process includes

a  comprehensive  system of checks and balances through  several

layers  of scrutiny and supervision.  Every day, at every police

division,  a duty Senior Investigation Officer (SIO) checks  the

cases  reported for the day to see how they are handled.   Every

morning,  the Chief Investigation Officer (CIO) will  check  all

police  reports lodged in the previous 24 hours and the  actions

taken to deal with them.  More difficult cases are reviewed in a

Morning  Panel  chaired by the Commander or Head,  Investigation

(HI).   Thereafter, the CIO and HI will continue to monitor  the

cases that require further investigation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cases handled by the CID, which are the more serious and

complex  cases,  this  process of close supervision  is  further

enhanced   by   case   conferencing,  focusing   on   individual

investigations.   CID  has also strengthened  its  investigative

capability by implementing team investigation. This team  system

has  also  been adopted by the Land Divisions, first by Clementi

Police  Division,  in  tandem  with  the  introduction  of   the

Neighbourhood  Police Centres (NPCs).  Over time,  as  the  NPCs

become   a   common   feature  in  our  Land   Divisions,   team

investigation will become the norm.  For the more serious cases,

the AG's Chambers is consulted before a decision to prosecute is

made.   At  the AG's Chambers itself, a special Criminal  Review

Committee critically reviews and evaluates the evidence and  law

in every pending High Court trial and appeal to determine if the

charges or appeal should be proceeded with in court.  These  are

just illustrations I am giving.  But this approach permeates our

system where there are counter checks and balances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam talks about the recording of suspect's

statements.  First, let me put things in perspective.  Suspect's

statements  are only a variety of evidence that the police  will

usually  obtain  to  prove a case against  the  accused.   Other

evidence  is  independently obtained through the testimonies  of

other   witnesses,  identification  parade,  physical   evidence

obtained at the scene of crime, and other exhibits seized by the

police

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>

which connect the arrested person to the offence.  So let us not

just  look at confession statements and focus on that aspect  of

the evidence.  During the process of interview, the arrestee  is

confronted  with  these pieces of evidence  for  an  explanation

which  is  then  considered  with other  corroborative  evidence

before  a  decision  is  taken whether  or  not  to  charge  and

prosecute him.  Sir, the interview process seeks to find out the

truth,  not  to extract a forced confession.  In any  case,  the

arrestee  has  to be produced in court within 48  hours  of  his

arrest and indeed the court has to make a ruling, and the police

has  to make out a case, as to whether or not the accused person

should  be  further  remanded.   So  let  us  leave  it  to  the

discretion and powers of the court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in all High Court cases, an arrestee is

examined by a medical officer before and after the taking of his

statement.    Also,   anyone  who   is   assaulted   has   ample

opportunities  to complain to a senior officer tasked  to  check

the police lock-ups routinely to record any complaint, or indeed

subsequently, to family members who may visit him.  In  fact,  a

suspect can request for a medical examination any time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say this: police has no reason to convict innocent

people.  Think about it.  It is not in the interest of the Force

to  do this, as it would undermine the credibility, respect  and

confidence the Force enjoys in the eyes of the public.   If  the

wrong  person is charged and convicted, what it really means  is

that the guilty party remains free and probably will commit more

crimes.   Police  therefore has no reason  whatsoever  to  force

confessions out of innocent people.  What is more important,  as

I  have  assured  this House in the past,  MHA  and  top  police

management,  right  from the Commissioner of  Police  downwards,

will never condone such wrongdoing.  Quite the contrary, we take

a  tough  no-nonsense stance against black  sheep  officers  who

abuse their powers or who are sloppy in their work.  Thankfully,

Sir, such officers are not many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, complaints against police abuse of suspects dropped

from 94 in 1994 to 56 last year.  These complaints were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>

investigated  by the Service Development and Inspectorate  (SDI)

Department  of  the  Police Force.  The 56 complaints  represent

only  a minuscule 0.2% of the 27,073 suspects arrested in  1997.

Of   these,   only   10  cases  involving   14   officers   were

substantiated.  Of course, the errant officers were dealt with - departmentally  or  prosecuted in court.  This  represents  less

than 0.12% of our police force totalling over 10,900 officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important safeguard against police abuses is our courts.

The  fact that there are acquittals by our courts shows that the

system  is working.  Every investigator knows that any  evidence

adduced  in court against the accused, and this point  has  been

mentioned by Prof. Chin, including confession statements, can be

challenged and thrown out by the court.  Here again, the numbers

are  very  small.  But the fact that our courts have thrown  out

such  statements  shows  that  it  is  an  effective  safeguard.

Indeed,  the  small  number shows that  police  takes  its  work

seriously; police knows that its work will be scrutinised by the

courts, and that has resulted in the small numbers.  It  is  not

because,  as  Mr Jeyaretnam says, it is very difficult  for  the

courts to discover any wrongdoing.  Quite the contrary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, and Prof. Chin who specialises in evidence has mentioned

this  already,  the  law  ensures that  only  properly  obtained

confession evidence is admitted as evidence of guilt.  Under the

Criminal  Procedure  Code and Evidence Act, a  confession  which

appears  to  have  been obtained through  any  form  of  threat,

inducement  or promise is not admissible as evidence  in  court.

And, of course, as I have mentioned just now, the law places  on

the  prosecution the burden of proving beyond reasonable  doubt,

not just the overall case, but also that the confession was made

voluntarily.  Therefore, again, a high burden of proof.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a practitioner, Mr Jeyaretnam must know that it is not

uncommon   for  the  accused  person  to  try  to   weaken   the

prosecution's  case  by casting doubt on  the  manner  in  which

inculpatory  evidence has been obtained.  And I understand  that

very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>

often,  this is done quite at the last minute - at the trial  or

nearing  the trial, even though in the interim period there  may

have  been  other opportunities for the accused person  to  make

this  point.  The current law and practice, through  the  trial-within-a-trial  approach, or voir dire,  seeks  to  balance  the

public  interest  against the rights of the accused.   Over  the

years,  the  Courts have decided on what conduct is  proper  and

what  is  not.   The  practice is now well-established  and  the

system  works.  Therefore, I have no doubt that our Courts  will

continue to play this important safeguarding role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about videotaping the suspects'

statements.  Again, this point has been covered in this House, I

think,  not once but twice in the past.  And here we  have  said

that  it  is  not  a fail-safe method. Who is to  say  that  the

accused  would  not  make an allegation that  he  was  given  an

inducement or threatened before the videotaping took place?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, every jurisdiction must find its own

balance.  In Singapore, we see it right to balance the rights of

an  accused to be given a fair trial with the right of the State

to  devise  rules to ensure that those who are guilty  will  not

take  advantage of the law and get away scot-free.  Hence, under

our approach, a suspect has no inherent right to have his lawyer

present when the Police questions him.  Similarly, under section

122(6)  of  the  CPC,  that section serves an  extremely  useful

purpose  in  preventing  a  guilty  person  from  inventing  his

defences to surprise the prosecution at the trial.  And, indeed,

in  the UK, the 1994 Criminal Justice Act has adopted a position

similar to our `adverse inference' approach.  So the UK also has

moved  away  from the `right of silence' approach to a  position

similar  to  ours.  But Mr Jeyaretnam does not  cite  that.   He

cites the UK for other purposes which are useful to him but  not

those  areas  where  the UK has strengthened and  toughened  the

regime.   And  this is not the only area, there are other  areas

too.  The 1994 Criminal Justice Act, in conjunction with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>

the  Public  Orders Act, in the UK, has also toughened  the  law

giving Police greater powers of seizure and search.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point really is that sufficient safeguards exist in

our  laws  to  ensure that innocent persons are  not  convicted.

Just  to  run through quickly, these safeguards are -  in  fact,

Prof.  Chin has mentioned them -  requiring prosecution to prove

its  case  beyond  a reasonable doubt and to provide  sufficient

particulars  in the charge, exclusionary rules of evidence,  the

right to be heard in open court, the right of appeal to a higher

court; also the process of criminal revision and exercise by the

High  Court of its supervisory revisionary jurisdiction, and  so

forth.   Also, like I mentioned earlier, the Courts have devised

processes  such as pre-trial conferences which have  facilitated

greater disclosure between prosecution and defence counsel.   So

I think that has helped also to ensure a better balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I think the proof of the pudding is in the

eating.   Our  criminal justice system and its component  groups

have  received  accolades from both Singaporeans  and  objective

third parties.  For example, in 1996, the Singapore Police Force

received about 870 compliments, including 14 from foreigners.  I

should  show  some  of these letters to Mr Jeyaretnam.   Because

every  letter of compliment tells a heart-warming story.   In  a

survey commissioned by the Police Force in January 1997 covering

1,300  Singaporeans, 84% of the respondents agreed  or  strongly

agreed  that  the  Police was effective in maintaining  law  and

order.  98% felt that the expectations were met by the Police in

general.   In a more recent survey commissioned by the  National

Youth Council (NYC) in December last year where 600 youths  were

interviewed  face to face, 95% said that they  were  proud  that

Singapore  was a safe country.  They would not have said  so  if

the  Police  does  not do its job properly in  protecting  their

interests, and dealing effectively with criminals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have also been renown surveys overseas. The

Political and Economic Risk Consultancy or PERC, for example,  a

Hongkong-based organisation,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>

in  its July 1997 issue, put Singapore's Judiciary and Police in

the  top  spot  in  Asia.   Both the World  Economic  Forum  and

International Institute for Management Development (IMD)  ranked

Singapore first in the area of security in 1996.  Respondents in

the  two  surveys were confident that their person and  property

were  protected  in Singapore.  Indeed, in this  year's  survey,

just  released recently, IMD placed Singapore top  in  Asia  and

fourth  world-wide in the justice ranking.  Therefore, Sir,  the

bottom  line  is  that our law enforcement agencies  will  never

betray Singaporeans' trust and confidence in them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to quote one other example, which I had quoted before in

this House, but I think it bears reminding.  Because fair-minded

people  have, on honestly examining our criminal justice system,

given  top  marks to Singapore.  This is the case of  Dr  Harald

Schweizer,   who   came  to  Singapore,   visited   the   Police

establishments and looked at how our process works  first  hand.

That  was  in 1994 in the aftermath of the Michael Fay  episode.

The  House will remember that at that time, our system was under

severe  criticism by many, including the American media.  Rather

than  rely on second-hand media accounts or public comments,  Dr

Schweizer,  an  Associate Professor of  Sociology  and  Criminal

Justice  and  former Police Chief of a city  in  Texas,  visited

Singapore.   At the end of his one-week visit, he was unstinting

in  his praise for the Singapore Police Force.  This is what  he

wrote to President Clinton, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a long dose of police reality in the US, and after

visiting numerous police agencies in Latin America and Europe, I

would  rather  be investigated by the SPF than any other  agency

here."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Police will exercise its powers in accordance with the law

as  determined by the Courts, whether it is powers of arrest  or

powers  of  interview or right of counsel.   Indeed,  there  are

other  examples  where  our criminal justice  system,  including

Police investigation powers, have come out very well.  You  will

remember,  for  example, the cases of John Martin Scripps  where

Police did a fine job in investigating

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>

and  then securing his conviction; and Flor Contemplacion, which

is an outstanding example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude and not take any more time of this

House.   I  think enough time has been wasted by  Mr  Jeyaretnam

raking up this old issue.  The Government's position on law  and

order  is clear.  Our fundamental concern is to safeguard public

interest - to protect Singaporeans and others who live or  visit

Singapore  so  that  they will have peace  of  mind  that  their

persons  and  properties are safe and secure.   We  do  this  by

putting  the  interest  of  the community  first.   We  make  no

apologies  about  it.   But does it, therefore,  mean  that  the

rights  of arrested persons are ignored?  The answer is a  clear

no.   Their rights are there, they will be respected.  But  what

these rights are, every society must determine and find its  own

balance.   For  us  in  Singapore, our  laws  and  investigative

methods are fair.  They seek to draw out the facts and the truth

so  that  justice  will prevail.  I think this is  the  starting

point  of  Mr  Jeyaretnam's speech today in this  House  -  that

justice  must prevail.  So let me assure him and others in  this

House  that  justice  will prevail and that there  are  adequate

safeguards.   And,  indeed,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  also  talks   about

accountability, transparency, openness - yes, these  are  tenets

we will abide by.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our criminal justice system is working well. This state of

affairs  has  not come about by accident.  It is the  result  of

every  component  part of the system - from the law  enforcement

agencies such as the Police, to the Attorney-General's Chambers,

to  our  Courts - playing its part efficiently, but  fairly  and

properly.   Indeed, the Chief Justice stated this in his  recent

Subordinate  Courts  Workplan Seminar Keynote  Address  when  he

said,  "The  risks of the innocent being convicted, and  of  the

guilty  being  acquitted, must be as low  as  human  fallibility

allows."   Indeed,  this  sentiment  is  shared  by  the   other

component  groups  of our criminal justice system.   Whilst  the

system  is not perfect, and no system is perfect, the effort  to

make  it a better one is on-going.  Definitely, there is no need

for  a  Commission  of Inquiry.  Indeed,  I  think  this  is  Mr

Jeyaretnam's pet approach.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>

He  will  call for a committee, a board, a Commission of Inquiry

at every turn, for whatever manner of topics.  But, Sir, this is

not how the PAP Government governs.  Yes, where appropriate,  we

do involve Singaporeans in many areas of civil society.  But let

us  not  just do it because Mr Jeyaretnam, out of the blue,  six

years  after he had first made a call, comes to this  House  and

say,  "Let's have a Commission of Inquiry." thus wasting  public

funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final word must be on the people operating our

system.   No  system is perfect or foolproof.   Ultimately,  any

system  is  only as good as the people operating it.   The  best

safeguard,  therefore,  rests  in the  competence,  honesty  and

integrity  of the people administering the system, whether  they

are  the investigators, prosecutors or judges.  As in all  other

areas  of  public service in Singapore, members of the  criminal

justice  system  are  geared  up  to  meet  these  high   public

expectations.  I am sure, Sir, they will not be found wanting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say, without any

disrespect to the two speakers, that my task has been made  very

easy because no attempt has been made to come to grips as to how

these  men  came to be charged with murder and came very  close,

two  of  them, to being hanged when they were totally  innocent.

No  attempt  has been made, I said, to try and explain  how  did

this  happen  in Singapore.  The junior Minister says  Singapore

Police  have  got  great praise.  But how did  this  happen?   I

shudder  to think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the defence had  not

pressed  for  this  man who the defence said had  committed  the

murder,  and  he had not been called, the two men  charged  with

murder  may have been convicted and they would have been hanged.

Then there is no recall of the punishment meted out to them.   I

think  if you want to be serious about this, you have to get  to

grips with the specific problem that was presented.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first speaker, Prof. Chin, and the Minister of State also,

rely on the praise of the system.  The one thing we are avid for

is  praise in Singapore.  We seem to be very eager to be praised

by  people  outside.   But  who  are  these  people  who  praise

Singapore?   Are they people who are qualified to speak  on  the

Police  investigation methods in Singapore?  Or are they talking

about  the efficiency?  I myself have praised the way the courts

have  speeded up trials.  But that is not what I am  complaining

about.   I  am talking about the investigation methods that  the

Police adopt.  Is the Minister aware that the confession in many

cases  is  the  shortcut  method?  It spares  the  investigating

officer   from   having   to  go  and  make   minute,   detailed

investigations  and to look for corroborative evidence.   So  he

has an interest in, if it is possible, getting an accused person

to admit to the offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also talks about the doctrine of oppression. But I

gave  an  example  of  a  man who was  subjected  to  continuous

questioning for 24 hours.  Is that not oppression?  How did that

come  about?   The Minister of State says there have  been  many

changes made since 1989.  I am glad to hear that, but he has not

told  us  what changes have been made.  Have we been  told  that

there are now new directives to police officers that questioning

of  suspects  must not extend more than a certain  period,  that

they must be given rest, they must be given food and ensure that

they  are  given  food and rest?  Let us know  what  these  many

improvements that have been made since 1989.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of time was spent by the two speakers talking about what

happens  in  the  courts.  May I repeat.   My  concern  is  what

happens  when particularly, as I said, the weak, the uneducated,

illiterate  man  is held in police custody, shut  off  from  the

world,  shut  off  from  members of his family,  shut  off  from

seeking  any  counsel or lawyer's advice.  That  is  what  I  am

concerned  with.   I have said, in my speech,  that  there  were

these  men  who told the court that they only confessed  because

they  could  not take the treatment any longer.  The  court,  of

course, accepted the evidence of the police officers that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>

they  did  not do anything to force the statement, the men  came

out voluntarily with their statements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question about audio taping. Does the Minister of

State  know  that the Law Society of Singapore, some years  ago,

made a recommendation that audio taping of statements taken from

accused  persons should be produced in court so that  the  court

may  listen to the audio tape and decide what exactly  went  on,

what  questions  were  put and what answers  were  given  by  an

accused person?  But that has not been accepted, let alone video

taping.   We have not made any recommendation for video  taping.

But there was this recommendation in the United Kingdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State says: what basis is there for a Commission

of Inquiry?  May I repeat.  The basis is in this one case alone.

Are  we  not interested in finding out how did this happen?   Or

are  we not interested?  Are we going to say, "Everything is all

right with us.  We don't have to inquire into wild allegations."

But  these are not wild allegations.  The Minister of State says

that  the Judicial Commissioner found that the confessions  were

made  voluntarily.   I  do  not know whether  he  has  read  the

judgement of the Judicial Commissioner.  As I said, the Judicial

Commissioner  did  not  go into that  question.   There  was  no

specific  finding on that.  He simply said that the officer  had

reasonable grounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised to hear the Minister say that just because a

person  is  acquitted, it did not mean that he  was  necessarily

innocent.   These men, as I said, were shown later to have  been

totally innocent.  There was no question about that.  So  please

try  and answer how is it that these men were charged.  And then

he  said  the  statements are only part of  the  evidence.   The

Police  have other evidence.  But, as I said, in this particular

case,  there was no other evidence.  There was only the evidence

of  these men alleged to have been made and, as I indicated, the

IO  took the view that once he had the confessions, that was it.

He  had  them in the bag.  There was no need to go and look  for

other evidence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the Minister of State says there is no

inherent right in an accused person for lawyers.  What about the

Article  in the Constitution?  I know that the courts have  said

that  that right only avails after the Police have closed  their

investigations and they can deny the right until then.  But  the

Constitution does give the accused person a right.   Is  it  not

time we enforced this right in the Constitution?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that there was a survey among Singaporeans.

Has  the  survey  been carried out among persons  who  had  been

arrested and taken into police custody and what they felt  about

it?   Almost  every accused person, and this has  been  reported

once  about a man who was in police custody who, I think at  the

trial, said anything could happen when one is in police custody.

Those  were  his  words, "anything can  happen".   He  is  quite

helpless.  Are we not interested in protecting these men  whilst

they  are  in police custody?  As I said, I was hoping  that  we

would really get to grips with this case.  But we have not.  And

all we have are statements that everything is all right with our

system.  There is no need to have any Commission of Inquiry.  We

are all right.  So let us carry on as we do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there is a growing fear among

lawyers.   Has  the  Minister of State spoken to  lawyers  about

their  concern about innocent persons being found  guilty,  that

the  safeguards  are not enough?  And lawyers should  know  what

they   are  talking  about.   But  it  would  appear  that  this

Government is not interested in what lawyers may think  or  what

the  public  may  think.  The Government is sure  that  what  it

thinks is right and there is nothing wrong with our system.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Just a short reply, Sir. I

think  it  is  not  fair for Mr Jeyaretnam to  say  that  police

officers  try  to extract confession statements  as  a  shortcut

method  to  look for corroborative evidence.  I  think  this  is

really  unfair.   As  I  said just now, there  is  no  incentive

whatsoever  to  extract  a confession from  an  innocent  person

because  then  the  guilty party is still out  there  committing

crimes and giving more work to the Police.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I must assure this House that innocent people

have  nothing to fear.  The purpose of Police investigations  is

to   uncover  the  truth.   That  is  the  purpose   of   Police

investigations and not to convict innocent people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, when I mentioned the role of the courts, as did Prof. Chin, we

are  not saying therefore that we are just focusing on what  the

courts have done.  But my point is that the courts can and  have

effectively  acted  as a safeguard against  any  possibility  of

Police abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, he asked what improvements have been made since 1989.

If  he  had listened to my speech carefully, he would have heard

the  many improvements that have been made - team investigation,

pre-trial   conferencing,  the  fact  that  Police  looks   very

carefully at court decisions when it decides on whether  or  not

there is Police abuse, and the list goes on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I did not say that there is no inherent right to

counsel.  Yes, of course, the Constitution provides the right to

counsel.   But my point was that there is no inherent  right  to

counsel   during   Police  investigations.   The   courts   have

interpreted  Article  9  as  "as soon  as  may  be  reasonable",

definitely not if it interferes with Police investigations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, Sir, is that I have already, in my speech,

highlighted salient points on the case of Zainal bin Kuning  and

why there was no Police impropriety or wrongdoing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister, when he said about

improvements, have any directives been given to police  officers

about  their questioning of suspects, as I said, how  long  they

can  be  questioned  and whether they are  given  sustenance,  a

record is kept?  Has anything been done on those lines, not pre-trial conferences in court?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam brings up the same

point a few times.  I think he has asked me this before in  this

House.   Like  I said, Police looks at court decisions.   It  is

very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>

important  that they comply with what the court says amounts  to

oppression.   Certainly the police does not want its  statements

to be thrown out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A suspect is questioned for 28 hours. Is

that not oppression?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> If indeed the police questions a

suspect for 28 hours, then it knows that it is opening itself to

the  possibility  that  the  court  will  find  that  there  was

oppression.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.

<div align="center"><b>LESS ADVERSARIAL PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to the signification of

support by at least one Member.  Does it have the support of any

other hon. Member?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House recognises the need to evolve a

parliamentary  system which is less adversarial and  which  will

further  strengthen the process of consultation,  consensus  and

conciliation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Shared Values motion was debated in

Parliament in 1991, consensus, not conflict, became one  of  our

shared  values.  Members will recollect, one of the five  values

discussed  was  "consensus  instead  of  contention".   Finally,

"contention" was left out and it emerged as "consensus  and  not

conflict".

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.46 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this spirit that I am seeking this House's

permission to debate this motion.  We should avoid conflict.  We

can and should debate issues.  We may disagree on points, we may

have  differences of opinion, but we should try to reconcile  to

reach consensus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message which this motion puts forward is an extension

of our Shared Values.  We should encourage consensus

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>

rather than contention.  The Shared Values did not deal with the

political culture.  I hope this motion will help to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Constitution provides for the

appointment of NMPs to give non-partisan views.  It is  in  this

spirit  that I propose this motion.  It is therefore  reassuring

to  recollect the words of the Leader of the House, Mr Wong  Kan

Seng, in this House when he spoke on 5th June 1997.  I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Depending on the merits of the issues, the NMPs have, at

times,  been  dissenting and critical, sometimes supportive  and

other times constructive in their views.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are conscious of the fact that after the ruling

party,  the  NMPs form the second largest number of  Members  in

this  House and whatever views we express in this House will  be

closely watched by the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would allow me, Sir, at this juncture to outline the

role  of Parliament, as I see it.  Parliament is the final forum

of  discussion where ideas are put forward and debated.  So,  by

its very nature, Parliament is adversarial.  There is no running

away  from  it.   The  question is: do we want  it  to  be  more

adversarial or less adversarial?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliament also has other roles. It enacts laws,

raises  taxes,  Government policies are discussed and  Ministers

are  accountable to this Parliament.  Questions for Oral  Answer

provide  a  valuable  device to query the Ministers.   And  this

morning, we have seen how supplementary questions were asked  to

elicit information for the benefit of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have inherited from the British the Westminster

system  of government.  In Britain, it has taken more  than  500

years  to  achieve this position.  It was not an  easy  journey.

Those  of  us  who  studied  constitutional  history  know  that

Parliament and the King would be in conflict.  Not everybody had

the right to vote.  Full franchise was only achieved during this

century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British democracy was not always what it is today. In

earlier centuries, heads had to be beheaded.  The Tower became

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>

home  for some.  Civil wars came and went.  Even the true  sense

of  Greek democracy could not serve the purpose today.  I do not

believe  in  Greek  cities where people met  to  propose  or  to

oppose.   Perhaps  they met to discuss the common  will  of  the

people.

.      Sir,  the  British  parliamentary  system  has  undergone

changes.  Just to illustrate, the office of the Speaker has  not

been  so  secure and safe as it is today.  The Speaker,  in  the

real  sense of the word, was a speaker.  He spoke to the monarch

on  behalf  of  the Commons.  And many a time,  the  message  he

carried was not a welcome one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Western critics, especially the human rights

groups  and even a small group of our own people, feel that  the

Western  democracy, in the British sense of  the  word,  is  the

ideal  model to be emulated.  Maybe it is or maybe not, that  is

for  the  individual.   We may be wearing  Western  clothes  and

speaking  the English language, but in basic necessity of  human

life  like  diet,  we  still prefer and  love  our  fried  rice,

noodles,  rendang, thosai and prata.  As the  saying  goes,  one

man's  meat  is  another man's poison, more  so  if  you  are  a

vegetarian.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can do no better than to quote Pandit Jawaharlal

Nehru who was a great admirer of British democracy and who was a

great freedom fighter, whose speeches  have been quoted in  this

House  before.   Let me quote him.  This is  what  he  told  the

Indian Constituent Assembly before independence.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not going just to copy, I hope, a certain

democratic procedure or an institution of a so-called democratic

country.  We may improve upon it.  In any event, whatever system

of  government we may establish here must fit in with the temper

of  our  people  and  be  acceptable  to  them.   We  stand  for

democracy.  It will be for this House to determine what shape to

give that democracy, the fullest democracy, I hope.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one of the basic tragedies of Asian leaders

was  that  they copied the constitutions of Britain, France  and

America.   They  imported Western government values  to  eastern

societies.  As a result, most of the constitutions have  failed.

Very few have succeeded and I will come to that later.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have an abiding faith in the people of Singapore and

also  the  political leadership and that we could have a  better

system  of  governance.   We have won international  praise  for

economic  miracles  for our sound financial  policies,  for  our

housing  scheme, for our security and safety, and even  for  our

environmental   matters.    But   what   is   saddening,    Sir,

occasionally,  what comes under criticism is our governance.   I

have  faith and hope that in the next 10 years, we will  succeed

even in this area.  We, the people and the Government, must work

out  a  system that will not just be a praise from the West  but

that  the people of Singapore themselves will feel that it is  a

system ideally suited to our soil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion is very straightforward. It is not a

binding resolution.  Members are free to speak.   The Government

can respond in the way it feels best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, in many British colonies, the

British  Westminster  model  was  held  as  an  ideal  form   of

government.   And most of the nationalist leaders  like  Mahatma

Gandhi,  Nehru, our former Prime Minister, the former  Malaysian

leader, Tunku Abdul Rahman, were all educated in England.   They

were mostly lawyers and socialism was a respectable creed.   Sad

to   say,   as   I  said  earlier,  few  countries  have   their

constitutions  intact.  Some countries had to  impose  emergency

rule.   Even  those  who have succeeded had  their  constitution

suspended and had to live with a bout of military dictatorship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have even a shorter history of

constitutional development.  Election was first introduced after

the  war  in  1948 and it was very limited.  There was  no  full

franchise.   But  the  turning  point  came  in  1959  with  the

attainment  of  self-government.  Prior to this, the  Government

which  constituted basically the Governor and his Secretary  and

the colonial office in London decided our fate and future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only those of us who have lived during the colonial

days  can  understand the denial and humiliation.   The  joy  of

gaining self-rule was evident when the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>

people of Singapore celebrated with joy the attainment of  self-government.  Speaking from the steps of City Hall in June  1959,

Mr Lee Kuan Yew echoed the feeling of the people when he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Once in a long while in the history of a people there

comes a moment of great change.  Tonight is such a moment in our

lives.   Last Saturday saw the end of an era.  This morning  the

new Constitution was promulgated.  We begin a new chapter in the

history  of  Singapore.  The powers of the people through  their

elected  government is limited to our internal affairs.   It  is

not  what  we  really  want.  It is but a step  forward  towards

merger and Merdeka.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have succeeded because we changed the system to

suit  our  needs.   We must keep an open mind  and  bring  about

changes  which will strengthen our system.  We have  an  elected

President,  GRCs,  NCMP, NMPs and the Maintenance  of  Religious

Harmony  Act,  just to mention a few.   Outside  Parliament,  we

have  the  Feedback Unit, GPCs and bodies like the Institute  of

Policy  Studies (IPS) and other civic bodies.  In short, we  are

evolving  our  own  practices to suit our  economic  and  social

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of IPS, it has regular discussions with

interested  groups.  Its "Singapore  the Year in Review"  is  an

important  discussion  which gives an  overview  of  Singapore's

issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have attended two of these discussions and the way

panelists,   including  my  Friend,  Dr  Lee  Tsao  Yuan,   were

questioned  assured me that our young people are not conformists

and  they  have  a questioning mind.  In short,  they  will  not

accept things at face value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I hope bodies like the Roundtable will flourish.

It is important to have non-partisan institutions.  Therefore, I

was  saddened  to  see  its motive questioned  by  some  of  our

leaders.   I thought that the Roundtable was being very  helpful

for  its review of the last general elections, pointing out some

of its pitfalls.  However, Sir, I am glad and reassured that two

of  its  members, Mr Simon Tay and Mr Zulkifli, now sit in  this

House.  We should try to support groups like the Roundtable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries of Asia, confrontational politics has

divided the people and retarded economic progress.  Political

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>

parties  have mushroomed and people with doubtful standing  have

contested and won elections.  Parties enter an alliance to share

power.   Politicians change parties to be  in  power.   The  end

result  is  that the people have suffered, and the parliamentary

system has been put to stress.  Perhaps I could, for the benefit

of  Members, give some synopsis of the Westminster's  system  of

government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Westminster's system of government, the

government  is divided into three organs - the Legislature,  the

Executive and the Judiciary.  Both the legislature and judiciary

are highly adversarial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to show how our judicial system, which has

been  mentioned  by the Minister of  State earlier,  has  become

less  adversarial.   As we all know, in the  court  trial  every

argument has to be challenged and demolished in order to be won.

Singapore   has   implemented   mediation,   conciliation    and

arbitration  to  settle  disputes.  As the  Minister  of  State,

Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee, had earlier pointed out in this House,

we  are  now  implementing  community mediation.   Our  judicial

system  has been held as a model.   I know some Members may  not

agree but the general tone is, both in Singapore and outside, we

have  a  first class judicial system.  I know of one  particular

Chief Justice from the Commonwealth countries who has shown some

interest.   In  fact,  he has sent some  judges  to  study  this

system.   This change came about without any pressure  from  the

public.   The  judiciary had recognised the  need  to  transform

because  there  were backlogs of cases.  The new  Chief  Justice

felt  that  we could not carry on with the old and he introduced

new  methods.  The backlog has gone.  Cases are dealt with  more

expeditiously  and  so there is no waiting time  for  criminals.

They  get  their  just  dessert in time.   Can  this  Parliament

similarly take the lead in bringing about some change that  will

benefit the country?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members may ask why there is a need to discuss this

motion  when  the system is working well.  Many of our  citizens

take   for   granted  that  the  system  will  survive  forever.

Experience of other countries provides valuable lessons.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>

Some  countries  take pride of their democracy, but  even  local

communities  are  often  divided on political  line.   Sometimes

families,  relatives  and  even areas  are  divided  because  of

political   affiliation.    They  adopt   very   confrontational

politics.   Violence,  arson, killing  of  political  opponents,

criminals  run for office and in some countries, booth capturing

has become a political art.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A younger generation encouraged by political debate

elsewhere  may  want  to  emulate the confrontational  politics.

They  look  forward to heated debate in the House.   Some  think

that  if there is no controversy in the House, it is a lame duck

Parliament.   It  is  not the intensity of the  debate  but  the

quality  of  the  debate  which should  be  the  hallmark.   The

question  that has to be asked is this.  Has the policy improved

the  living standard of the people?  Has it brought a more  just

and equal society?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Sir, we are a multi-racial, multi-lingual and

multi-religious  nation.   People  and  political  parties  must

recognise that there are fundamental matters which we must never

transgress.   These are beyond questions.  To do so would result

in  undermining the foundation on which our peace and prosperity

is built.  Similarly, in dealing with the judiciary and security

we   have   to  be  very  circumspect.   Whenever  our  national

institutions are under attack, we must close ranks  and  defend.

We  cannot  be  divided  when our sovereignty  and  security  is

questioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we go about bringing a change in the thinking

and  mindset?  I would appeal to the ruling party  and  hope  to

persuade  them  to consult the opposition parties in  Parliament

whenever  major  issues  -  I emphasise  "major  issues"  -  are

discussed.  When the ruling party is prepared to listen to views

from the public, why not political parties in Parliament?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties in Parliament must give constructive

views  that  will help policy and not to oppose the policy  just

because  it is a Government policy.  If I could recollect,  Sir,

when the Select

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>

Committee was discussing the amendment to the Constitution,  one

political party's representative made an absurd proposition that

the  Bill was unconstitutional.  The learned man was challenging

a  Member  of  the  Select Committee, Prof. Jayakumar,  who  had

lectured  Constitutional  Law at  NUS.   The  politician  was  a

British trained lawyer.  He had not studied the Constitution  of

Singapore  as a subject.  Had he studied it in some  detail,  he

would  have  realised that there was precedent  for  non-elected

Members  in  the   Constitution even before it was  amended.   I

speak  of  the appointment of Speaker from outside  the  elected

Members.   Sir,  we must avoid a similar situation.   Opposition

for  the sake of opposition is negative and futile.  I think the

opposition parties must change their thinking.  If they want  to

contribute  to  the  political process, they must  review  their

stand.  It calls for a change in outlook.  It is hard to believe

that the Government does not deserve the praise for many of  its

achievements,  be  it in housing, transport, education  and  the

banking system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a policy is discussed in Parliament, some of the

best  minds  in the civil service would have studied the  matter

over  many  months, often making comparative studies with  other

countries  and  trying to avoid any shortcoming.  Our  Ministers

and   MPs  consult  the  public  through  feedback  and  through

political  discussions  among the PAP activists.  They  have  to

convince  the  people.   No policy can  succeed  unless  it  has

popular support from the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a feeling among some members of the public

that some Members of the PAP treat the opposition with contempt.

The PAP has succeeded in being elected with such an overwhelming

support.   This  may lead to some MPs thinking  that  opposition

parties are peripheral.  Success sometimes brings some degree of

intellectual superiority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that there is a place for

opposition  parties in Parliament. Some constructive  opposition

will  be  good  to  our system.  But to say  that  there  is  no

democracy without opposition is an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>

intellectual dishonesty.  In the final choice, the  people  must

decide  whether they want an opposition or not.  It is  not  for

the  opposition to decide.  For that matter, it is not even  for

the PAP to decide whether there should be an opposition or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the benefit of visiting some countries and observing

their system.  In many countries, they not only abuse each other

verbally  but physically in Parliament.  Shoes and slippers  fly

in  the well of the Chambers.  Even the Presiding Officer is  in

fear  of  himself.  Sir, it is a credit to our  Parliament  that

even during the hey-days of Barisan Sosialis, the proceedings in

this  Chamber were conducted with decorum and dignity.  This  is

what Parliament is and we should aspire to be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, it has become a part of life to enjoy

conflicts.  The media especially enjoys reporting this conflict.

We  too  had  our  share of confrontational  politics  when  the

question  of  merger was discussed.  The House sat  past  dinner

time  many a night to debate the issues.  The Ministers, instead

of  concentrating on economic development, had to spend hours of

their  time defending the Government's existence.  Those  of  us

who were young can remember it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a tendency among some of our younger citizens

to  expect Parliament to have heated debates.  They think it  is

fun and game.  They think it is tamasha, a show to be enjoyed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is fashionable to be confrontational, some of

our intellectuals think that democracy without confrontation  is

a tame democracy or, worse still, no democracy.  We have to tell

them  that  the  ultimate  test is whether  the  Government  has

brought  happiness to the lives of the people  and  whether  the

people can live a life of dignity and freedom instead of fear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we strengthen the consultative process? This

is  a question that I pose to this House.  In the last 10 years,

more  avenues have been opened up.  Our Prime Minister is a firm

believer  in the consultative process.  He has set up Government

Parliamentary Committees (GPCs). These Committees also include

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>

members from the public as resource panel members, and I am  one

such member of the GPC for Community Development which is headed

by Dr S. Vasoo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in February 1991, I wrote to the Prime Minister about

the  enhanced  role  of  the GPCs. The  Prime  Minister  gave  a

positive  reply  and,  in fact, in the  President's   Speech  in

February 1991, the matter was dealt with.  May I quote from  the

Speech of the President:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Government Parliamentary Committees will play a more

prominent  role.   We will encourage the public  to  give  their

views  to the GPCs, especially on issues which do not go to  the

Select Committee.  The GPCs should not only express these  views

in  Parliament,  but  also  follow  them  through  by  proposing

amendments to improve legislation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two observations. First, bring the GPCs within

the  purview  of  the  House.  At the  moment,  it  is  not  so.

Secondly,  GPCs should be given manpower and money  to  play  an

enhanced  role.   On  important Bills, GPCs  should  invite  the

public  to  give  written representations.   I  wonder  why  the

Government's plan has not been implemented, especially  when  it

was first announced in 1991.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Community Development has started its

Feedback  Unit.  The Unit in fact has improved and a  number  of

Committees  have  been  set up to study different  issues.   The

members  are  well  qualified  and  respected  members  of   our

community.   I  can foresee an important input by  the  Feedback

Unit, now that the Minister of State, Dr John Chen, a Government

Minister, is at the helm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our media is taking an active interest in topical

issues.   The  Straits  Times  has  a  political  desk  and  its

"Insight"  covers current issues with some depth, getting  views

from  people  of all strata. The lead articles give opinions  on

topical issues.  The Straits Times through its lead articles and

Forum  Page  helped in changing the tone of the  Maintenance  of

Parents  Act.   Because of this input, the Act is a  better  Act

now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, let me add that there is a lingering

perception  in  the minds of some sections of our intelligentsia

that our print media is overtly pro-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>

Government.   It is for the print media to take the  heed.   But

there  is no running away that in the case of the Straits Times,

it  has come of age as a result of its ability to draw out  some

of the best young men and women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a very lively Forum column. People express

their  views.   But again there is a small minority  which  feel

that  if  they  criticise the Government policy, they  would  be

ridiculed  or, worse still, questioned by the authority.   These

fears,  I  would like to assure them, are unfounded.   Catherine

Lim   was  an  unfortunate  episode.   The  boundary  line   for

discussion  has  to be redrawn from time to time.   Our  leaders

sometimes act like over-protective parents.  They must learn  to

trust  the people.  Singaporeans are pragmatic.  They know which

side  of the bread is buttered.  They are not going to be  taken

away  by sweet talks.  They value political stability more  than

anything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the past is any gauge of the future, there seems to be a

dim  possibility of any credible and strong opposition  emerging

in  the  near  future.  Parliament may have  to  consider  other

options to strengthen the present system. Those who do not agree

with the ruling party should have a channel of communication. We

may  want  to institutionalise some of them.  I have  spoken  of

that  earlier.   Perhaps the Town Councils and  the  CDCs  could

provide  valuable  inputs in addition to the  existing  channels

like  RCs  and CCCs.  These bodies could be further strengthened

by  soliciting ideas from the residents.  As their meetings  are

mostly closed door, it will encourage a free flow of ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I am glad that private housing estates are

also  going to form their own Committees.  My plea is that these

Committees should work with the existing institutions in the HDB

heartlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I urge the Government leaders to consider

reviewing   the  electoral  arrangement.   Whilst  the   present

electoral arrangement should be largely adhered to, maybe  about

10%   of  the  Members  of  this  House  could  be  elected   on

proportional representation.  I know the danger of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>

proportional  representation. But yet I  am  making  this  plea.

This  is  why  I  am keeping only 10% as the upper  limit.   Or,

perhaps,  even the NCMP scheme could be enlarged.  Sir,  I  know

when  the NCMP scheme was first announced, some parties  opposed

it.  But parties have changed position, I hope, for the good  of

Singapore and for themselves as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our civil society is growing; our clan associations

and self-help bodies can help in giving input as well.  It is in

our  Republic's interest to nurture a civil society.  Therefore,

I  found  it reassuring that the Prime Minister told this  House

last  year that he wanted a civil society to grow.  May I  quote

from his speech, Sir?  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need a civil society to mobilise our people's energies

and  talents,  and  to create a cohesive and  resilient  nation.

When   people  participate  actively  and  become  involved   in

community  and national issues, they build ties among themselves

and bond to the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must change the mindset that only a few leaders at the

top  of  the  system  need to think and take responsibility  for

social and national issues, while the rest of society can simply

mind  their  own business and go about their daily  lives.   All

Singaporeans must feel a responsibility for solving local issues

and shaping their own communities.  They should not wait for the

Government  to solve every problem.  The Government itself  must

be  prepared to take a step back and perhaps even a  back  seat,

especially on local community issues, and allow some  free  play

to develop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good way to do this is for concerned citizens to get

involved in voluntary work or in the running of their own  local

communities,   through   the  Town  Councils,   CDCs   or   RCs.

Singapore's  political  life must evolve  in  the  direction  of

greater  participation  by  the  people,  more  willingness   to

shoulder  responsibilities, and more giving to the country  than

taking."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From consultation, Sir, I now move to consensus. This is

the  most  difficult  task because of conflicting  interest  and

lobby groups.  It is not possible for the Government to seek the

views  of everybody on every issue.  To do so would be to weaken

the  working  of  the  government.  But  on  major  issues  like

housing,  transportation and education,  the  Government  should

reach  consensus,  both  within the political  parties  and  the

people.   In this, I think the civic groups can play  a  pivotal

role in articulating views.  Similarly, the various

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>

societies and interested groups should study the issues and give

their views to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is interested in building consensus.

It is therefore not surprising that the PAP Government agreed to

incorporate public views in preparing its political manifesto  - The  Next Lap.  This is the best form of consensus building  for

the PAP.  Similarly, the Government has set up Select Committees

on  important issues like GRC, Elected President and Maintenance

of  Religious  Harmony  Act.   These Committees  benefited  from

public  participation and in some of the cases public  proposals

were  accepted.  Take the case of the GRC Bill.   The  Bill  was

amended to include a minimum number of seats for the minorities,

and the Indian community was mentioned by name.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on conciliation, Sir. We can take heed from the

industrial strife in the 1960s and the orderly manner  in  which

our  commerce and industry has prospered because of this process

of conciliation with the labour and employers.  We have to trade

off  some  points.  We have to accommodate because, as has  been

said  previously,  nobody  or  institution  has  a  monopoly  of

knowledge.   We sometimes make mistakes but we must  learn  from

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying that at the family level, the disputes are

now  settled  through conciliation in our family courts  in  the

Subordinate  Courts.   This is indeed a very  progressive  step.

Can the same process be adopted at the national level?  Whenever

there  is  a  difference  on  major issues,  we  should  try  to

accommodate the other's wishes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whenever we are talking of consensus, conciliation and

consultation, one thing must stand out - that it must be in  the

national interest to discuss it, to adopt it.  We must not allow

sectarian  interest  to do so.  We should never  have  a  hidden

agenda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I started my speech on the Shared Values and I want to

end  on  the same note.  I want hon. Members to reflect  on  the

words of the Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee.  Let me quote him:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In every society there are disputes and differences of

opinions,  over private matters, over commercial  affairs,  over

great issues of state.  It is only natural and healthy.  Without

constructive  debate,  without a lively exchange  of  views,  no

society  can  hope to break new ground and make  progress.   But

societies  differ  in  the ways by which they  seek  to  resolve

differences of views.  Some try to conciliate opposing views and

smooth  over the differences; others fight it out in adversarial

proceedings in Court.  They believe that out of sound  and  fury

will come sweetness and light."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I had

originally  wanted  to support the motion  raised  by  our  hon.

Nominated  Member.   But having heard the  speech  of  our  hon.

Member, I can only say that while I agree with the principle  of

the  motion, I cannot support the conclusion which he wants this

House to adopt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just keep this response rather brief in order that

we can deal with the issues on hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question that we have to ask ourselves is: can

there  be  a less adversarial approach to politics?   To  answer

this  question, I think we need to ask an even more  fundamental

question  about  the  role  of this  House  in  the  legislative

process.   Do  we  see legislators in this House  as  performing

primarily  the  role  of  a critic to scrutinise  and  embarrass

Government?   Or do we see the role of this House  as  one  that

seeks  to  improve the legislative process so that the interests

of the people can be better served?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will note that the collapse of communism in the

80s  has  brought about an increasing convergence  of  political

ideologies.   Communism and socialism, as we  know  it,  are  no

longer  fashionable.   Few would deny that the  market  economy,

founded  on  a model of democracy that seeks to equitably  share

wealth  of  a country, is a dominant political ideology  in  the

world today.  While there are differences as to how one may find

expression to these values, it will be difficult for the  masses

to  find  favour  with anyone who says that  he  believes  in  a

command  economy  and  in a dictatorial regime  which  does  not

account  to  the people.  The left and the right  it  seems  are

moving towards the middle ground.  In this climate, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>

would  be  very difficult for parties to take extreme positions.

No  party  seeking the mandate of the people can move away  from

this middle ground and seek to win the right to rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislators must recognise this. The way to the middle

ground  and politics is not through adversarial approach because

it  is  not  a  competition of ideologies  but  a  consultative,

consensus  and  conciliation approach or what we call  consensus

approach.  Sir, to that extent, therefore, I support the call of

the  Nominated Member that we should move towards a position  in

our  political arena that is more consensus seeking rather  than

adversarial in approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, endorsing consensus politics does

not  in  itself mean an end to competition.  The choice  of  the

people  can be made on the basis of personalities, on the  basis

of  how we want to approach the objects that are defined as  the

interests of the country.  To that extent, therefore, we  should

ask   ourselves  how  this  approach  to  politics  applies   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving his motion, the Nominated Member actually called

for  the Government to consult the Opposition Members in the way

we   formulate  policies.   I  find  this  rather  strange   and

surprising because in the nature of our political process  where

we  are  required to go to the people to seek a mandate  of  the

people.  Democracy is necessarily a question of choice.  At  the

end  of  five  years or so, we go back to the  people  with  our

record, our platform, and our agenda to persuade the people that

we offer the best slate of leaders and programmes for our people

to  choose.   Asking  us  to consult the Opposition  Members  as

regards policy formulation is like asking the opposing team in a

football  field  how you play the game.  In the  nature  of  our

politics,  I  think  it  will be quite unusual  indeed.   It  is

something which does not make sense for us at this moment.   And

I  do  not think we have arrived at a position where we need  to

consult the Opposition in respect of policies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Nominated Member has also asked us to consider to

review  the  electoral arrangement to bring about a proportional

representation  by  10%  in  this House  itself.   This  is  not

something  which, I think, makes sense or is supported.   If  we

talk about 10% proportional representation in the House, on what

basis  are  you  deciding as to who has the right  to  make  the

representation in this House?  As we all know it, in the  nature

of  our  system, there are many avenues within this  House  that

provide  ample  opportunities for people outside to  make  their

representations and make their views known.  The  fact  that  we

have  NMPs and an NCMP in this House and the fact that  we  have

avenues  for people to participate in the policy process  itself

suggest  that  there  are avenues within the  House  that  allow

people to participate in the policy process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, while I understand the call on the part of

the  Nominated  Member  to  actually  open  up  the  process  of

consultation in policy making, I do not think that we should  go

that far in the way that he has suggested, and I would call upon

the  Member  to  essentially look at the position  that  he  has

advanced  more carefully.  I think in the nature of  things,  in

the   nature   that  we  understand  it,  there  are  sufficient

safeguards for us to consider the opposing views, if there  are,

in  the  way in which policies are made and considered  in  this

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I basically do not support the motion to

the  extent  that  he  has  asked us to  support  the  call  for

consultation  of  the Opposition and to expand the  proportional

representation in this House to include other interest groups as

well.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

have  been in this House for 18 years and I have engaged in many

debates  in  this House and I do not think we were  adversarial.

We were hard-hitting, yes.  We take the Ministers on.  They give

us  a  few punches back.  But at the end of the day, we  have  a

meaningful debate.  We share views, constructive in nature, yes.

But  we  were never adversarial.  So I was quite surprised  when

this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>

subject   was   brought  up,  asking  for  a  less   adversarial

parliamentary  system.   He even said that  during  the  Barisan

Sosialis  days, yes, those were hot days when the  debates  were

very  heated, but I do not think, if you go through the Hansard,

there  were  instances  where there  were  things  being  thrown

around.   But  in  asking  this House  to  support  for  a  less

adversarial  system  gives  the  impression  that  we   had   an

adversarial  system  in the past.  It had  been  non-adversarial

debates in this House for so long.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not know whether he is directing this to any

political  party in this House that is adversarial.  I  can  say

that the PAP Members in this House are not adversarial.  We  are

hard-hitting, as I said, sometimes.  But at the end of the  day,

we  are not adversarial.  So the Member who proposes this motion

should  state  clearly in this House which  political  party  is

adversarial.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to focus

on  the  second  part  of the motion, that is,  that  the  House

recognises the need to evolve a parliamentary system which  will

further strengthen the process of consultation and consensus.  I

would like to make three broad points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that there is a relative lack of effective mechanism

for public policy discourse in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that Parliament which represents the elected voice

of   the  people  can  be  more  effectively  used  as  a  major

institution for public policy engagement; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I shall then propose several means by which

Parliament can more effectively serve this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to submit to this House a hypothesis regarding

the  current situation where consultation and consensus building

is  concerned.  As an economist, I think in economic  terms,  so

please  allow  me to use an economic analogy.   I  believe  that

there  is at present a disequilibrium situation of excess demand

for public policy discussion.  There is now a greater demand for

public  consultation and feedback than in  the  past,  and  this

demand is likely to increase even more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>

in  future.   At the same time, particularly in the  1990s,  the

supply  of  channels  for  public  policy  discourse  has   also

increased.   There  are  now  more  channels,  both  formal  and

informal,  for  consultation  and feedback.   However,  I  would

submit that the increase in demand has outpaced the increase  in

supply resulting in a disequilibrium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the marketplace, such an excess demand situation would be

corrected  during  adjustment  in  prices.   However,   in   the

intellectual  marketplace of ideas, there is no  such  automatic

mechanism  to  adjust for a situation of excess  demand.   As  a

result,  a disequilibrium situation of excess demand can persist

for some time.  As in the case of economics, I believe that such

a disequilibrium situation is unhealthy and that steps should be

taken to rectify the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has demand for public policy discourse increased? I can

offer three reasons.  The first reason is that our very economic

success  has satisfied our basic human needs and has  engendered

the   desire   for  higher  order  needs,  such  as   that   for

participation and belonging in society.  Over the last 30 years,

Singapore's  GDP  per capita has increased by more  than  eight-fold.   This increase in real per capita income has enabled  our

material  quality of life to improve by leaps and bounds.   Home

ownership, ownership of consumer durables, life expectancy,  all

of  these  have shown marked improvement.  In short,  our  basic

material needs are by now more than taken care of.  A generation

ago,  our  parents'  prime concerns were mainly  over  making  a

decent  living,  owning  a home, giving their  children  a  good

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these needs are still important today, economic success

has  added  a  new dimension to society's needs and aspirations.

There  are many in society who are no longer satisfied with  the

mere  pursuit of material gains.  They aspire towards  something

more  and,  that is, a sense of belonging in society.   Part  of

that  aspiration would include that of having a say  in  policy,

particularly those policies which affect their lives as citizens

of this country.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that our population, particularly the

young,  are  now more highly educated.  We have made significant

strides  in  education  since the 1970s.   The  entry  ratio  of

polytechnic students increased from 2% in 1965 to 37%  in  1995.

Similarly, the entry ratio of university students increased from

4%  to  20% during the same period.  Therefore, we find that  of

those  aged  15  to 39, 72% of the workforce now have  secondary

level  education and above and soon 60% of those  in  their  20s

would have tertiary level education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that globalisation, including access to

information  via the Internet, has created greater awareness  of

the    larger   socio-political   environment   internationally,

regionally  and  domestically.   As  a  result  of  these  three

factors, there are more and more in Singapore society today  who

are interested in public policy, have an opinion on these issues

and  want to have a say.  They may not necessarily be interested

in  joining  a political party per se.  But they hold  the  view

that,  as  citizens of Singapore, they should be  concerned  and

that  this concern should be expressed by speaking up on  public

policy  issues.   Some  of these views may  be  frivolous,  some

criticise  for criticism's sake.  But there are also some  which

are  sincere and well-thought-through in their views.   Although

some  in  this  group would insist that they are right  and  the

Government  is  wrong, many would consider  it  sufficient  that

there  be serious engagement.  They wish that they be given  the

space to express their views, critical or complimentary, without

fear  of  retribution  that  these views  be  heard,  given  due

consideration and that the merits and demerits of these views be

objectively   and   rationally  debated  in   public,   in   the

intellectual marketplace of ideas and may the best idea win.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the supply of mechanism for public policy

discourse?  The number of channels has increased in recent years

and  more  effective use has been made of them as  well.   These

include  the grassroots organisations, such as the RCs and  CCCs

under  the People's Association, the recently expanded  Feedback

Unit, the Ministries' specific committees and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>

groups,  formal  and informal, established for  the  purpose  of

consultation  and  feedback.  There are in addition  other  more

general dialogue sessions, for example, the two recent occasions

where   the   Prime   Minister  met   young   Singaporeans   and

professionals,  respectively.  In  addition  to  the  Government

channels, there has also been more active use of the Forum  page

of  The  Straits Times as a channel for expression and feedback.

And  if  I may say so, the Institute of Policy Studies, where  I

work, has, as its objectives, the twin role of furthering public

policy discussion by means of research and conferences and being

a bridge builder among the various sectors of Singapore society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then do I know if there are now more channels for

consultation and feedback if there is still an excess demand?  I

will  be  the first to admit that I have no statistics, no  hard

and  fast  evidence.   But  when one hears  the  dissatisfaction

regarding  the existing situation repeated over and over  again,

different forums by different people, then surely it amounts  to

more  than  just a passing fancy or a temporary phase.   And  if

anything  else,  this dissatisfaction seems to have  intensified

and  not  diminished over the years.  It would appear that  this

demand  is  strongest among the professionals  and  the  younger

generation.   It  may  not  be  a  major  concern  of  the   HDB

heartlanders.   But with education, this demand will  strengthen

and not diminish.  All over Asia, economic well-being has led to

the  emergence  of a middle class that is better educated,  more

socially and politically aware and more demanding of a voice  in

what  affects them.  There is no reason why Singapore should  be

so different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament, mainly comprising the people's representatives,

is  the key institution for the conduct of public policy debate.

In  fact, this is already happening today.  When the elected MPs

speak,  they  often  represent the  views  of  their  respective

constituencies.  However, there can be better use of  Parliament

as  an institution for public debate on policy issues of current

interest.   In  other words, in addition to passing  legislation

which is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>

in  itself a primary responsibility of Parliament, it  would  be

desirable for Parliament to be used even more as a major channel

for policy discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy issues range from the strategic and national to the

specific  and municipal.  I would like to see greater discussion

of  major  policy changes in Parliament when they are announced.

What  is  currently  occurring  is  that  Backbenchers  use  the

Committee of Supply debates as the main occasion for bringing up

issues  under the specific Ministry cut.  But why lump them  all

together at one sitting and not discuss these policies when they

are hot off the press?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is there are many changes in educational policy

which  have  occurred in recent years.  Many of  these  are  not

merely refinements of the system but represent systemic changes,

indeed,  a major rethinking of the very philosophy of education.

One  such  example  is the recent announcement  on  The  Desired

Outcomes of Education.  At all stages of the educational  system

-  tertiary,  junior college, secondary, primary - this  set  of

Desired Outcomes will be used to assess the performance  of  our

formal  education system.  I would have liked to see this  major

policy change brought to the House for debate, not because I  do

not  agree with The Desired Outcomes, in fact, I was glad to see

the list, but because such a major policy deserves public airing

and   discussion.   Such  public  discussion  allows  for   good

suggestions  to be taken on board for future policy  refinement,

and  concern  and misconceptions to be clarified.   One  way  in

which this could be done would be for a motion to be moved,  for

example,  "That  the  House endorses  The  Desired  Outcomes  of

Education."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second and related proposal is that the Government

Parliamentary Committees (GPCs) play a more active role in  such

public  policy  discussions.  For example,  the  motion  on  The

Desired  Outcomes  could be moved by a Member  of  the  GPC  for

Education.   In  fact,  the GPCs already are  utilised  to  some

extent  in  this  manner.  GPCs could be  utilised  to  get  the

feedback  on these major policy changes.  These views  could  be

aired in the House

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>

during  the  policy  debate.  This  is  already  the  case,  for

example,  during the Budget debate when the Members of  the  GPC

for Finance and Trade and Industry bring to the attention of the

House  the  feedback  which  they  obtained  from  the  business

community.  The system of debating major policy changes  in  the

House  has  been done on occasions in the past.  I  recall  that

motions   were  moved  in  the  case  of  the  benchmarking   of

Ministerial salaries with the private sector in 1994 and for the

second  Cost Review Committee Report in 1996.  However,  what  I

would  like  to  propose is that every major  policy  change  be

debated  in the House and that the GPCs play an active  role  in

this discussion by gathering feedback and moving the motion.  If

necessary, if it calls for a serious policy change in debate,  a

White  Paper could be prepared, for example, in the case of  the

Ministerial salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where specific and municipal policy issues are concerned,

Question  Time  should suffice.  However, the one hour  allotted

for  Questions for Oral Answer is, in my opinion, too short  for

all  such  matters  to  be raised.  The  frustration  that  some

Members  experience is that there is insufficient time  for  all

Questions to be answered as occurred today.  There is of  course

the alternative of a Written Question.  But an answer in written

form does not permit the Member to seek further clarification on

the  spot  and to wait for another month for further elaboration

would  really be too long a delay.  My third proposal  therefore

is  that  Question  Time be lengthened to 1� hours.   One  could

argue that even this is insufficient.  But a 50% increase is, in

my view, a major improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two additional aspects of the public consultation

process that I would like to discuss.  The first is that we need

to  establish ground rules for this public discourse.   I  fully

understand  that  elected  Members  will  make  statements  with

political  objectives in mind.  That is the essence of politics.

But  we  should make every effort to debate in an objective  and

rational manner.  At times, the debate can and should be robust,

even  heated.   But such engagements should not be personal  and

should not be taken personally.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect which I would like to discuss is public as

opposed  to  private consultation and feedback.  I believe  that

there is room for both.  There are occasions when the Government

would  gather feedback on a private basis away from  the  public

eye.   This  is  particularly the case  when  providers  of  the

feedback  may not wish to be identified with the point  made  or

that  confidentiality of the policy is crucial, for example,  in

formulating  the Budget.  But public consultation  and  feedback

is,  I  believe, becoming increasingly important.  And it is  in

the latter case that Parliament can be more effectively used  as

a channel for such debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to discuss briefly my views on the first part

of  the motion, that of a less adversarial Parliament.  I do not

believe  that our present system is adversarial.  I  agree  with

the  Member  who  spoke just now on this matter.   If  anything,

apart from a few isolated incidents, Parliament is conducted  in

a  very  civil manner.  The expression of differences of opinion

should   not,   in   my   mind,   be   considered   adversarial.

Parliamentary  debates  should be encouraged  to  emphasise  the

objective  to  give  all, and especially  the  best  ideas,  the

opportunity to be heard.  While I agree that I would not like to

see a situation where there are fist-fights and hair-pulling  in

Parliament, I also do not envisage that this situation is likely

to  arise in this House in the near future.  Hence, while  I  am

fully  supportive that the motion should be debated in the House

and  for which reason I have supported the motion to be debated,

and  I  am  also  fully supportive of the second clause  of  the

motion, I am unable to give my full support to the first  clause

regarding the less adversarial system of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, allow me to reiterate my argument. The

telescoping  of  the  economic growth process  in  Singapore  is

unprecedented  in  world  history.   What  took  the   developed

countries  60 to 70 years to achieve, Singapore has achieved  in

30  years, half that time.  However, while the economic hardware

and  the  material  side have developed rapidly,  the  software,

including social and political institutions, has been slower  to

evolve.  As a result,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>

I  believe that there is this disequilibrium situation of excess

demand  where public policy discussion is concerned and,  hence,

in   this  context,  I  believe  that  Parliament  can  be  more

effectively  used  as a major channel for such consultation  and

feedback.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me commend Mr Rai for moving

this  motion  and Dr Lee for supporting him.  Both  have  indeed

made very illuminating speeches in this pretty late hour.  I  am

sure  we  agree  with much of what they say.   And  I  must  say

personally  that there are parts which I do not agree.   I  will

talk  about the parts which I agree first and, later on, I  will

explain the parts which I do not agree.  When I get to that part

of  my speech, I hope that he can understand my explanation  and

accept  what  I  say  and  agree with  me,  then  we  can  reach

consensus.  Even if he does not want to agree with me and  there

is no consensus, I hope he will not consider me as an adversary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Certainly not, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Neither will I be adversarial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we inherited the British Westminster system of

government and made it work.  Mr Rai rightly observed  just  now

and he quoted examples of many other countries, particularly the

ex-British  colonies, which tried and failed.  Indeed,  many  of

these  ex-colonies went through many constitutions  since  their

independence, from a parliamentary system of government  with  a

Prime Minister to a Presidential system, then military coup  and

perhaps  a  Presidential form of government, maybe another  coup

again, and so on and so forth.  I think we can see quite  a  few

of these examples in Africa, even today.  And there is no end to

the  problem  for  them.  But Singapore  has  succeeded  so  far

because  we are willing to adapt and evolve the system  that  we

have  inherited according to the changing social  and  political

circumstances  and according to the imperatives  of  our  multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious society.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we did not modify our electoral system, say, in 1988, today,

we  would  not  have  GRCs and perhaps we would  have  an  under

representation of minority races in this Parliament.  And if, in

1984,  we had listened to Mr Jeyaretnam and agreed with him  not

to  have  the  NCMP system, then we would not see Mr  Jeyaretnam

here today, and we would not have the NCMP system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in 1984 and even before that, the Government envisaged

that some of our people may want to see more heat and debate  in

Parliament.   They  wanted  to see the Opposition  heckling  the

Government,  criticising it, commenting on its policies  and  so

on.    That   is  why  in  1984,  the  Government  amended   the

Constitution and also our Parliamentary Elections Act to provide

for  the NCMP scheme.  So we have the NCMP here today because  I

do  not  think you can find anywhere else in the world  that  an

opposition, having contested in an election and lost, can find a

place  in  Parliament to criticise the very party  that  it  was

opposing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, had the Opposition parties been really effective in the

last  17  years   Mr Jeyaretnam came to Parliament in  1981,  Mr

Chiam  was elected in 1984 and Mr Jeyaretnam re-elected in  1984

today we would not have NMPs sitting in this House and giving us

suggestions,  constructive advice and the various  contributions

they have made in our debates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee's analogy of supply and demand in economics is very

interesting.  Indeed, I fully agree with her that there is  some

pressure  in  some quarters for more discourse on public  policy

and  therefore more people may want to speak up.   In  my  basic

understanding of economics, I thought there is a  way  to  clear

the supply and demand, and that is the price mechanism.  Perhaps

in  politics, some people may think that there is no price to be

paid  to  be  in Parliament.  I think there is.  If  people  are

really keen on a public discourse in Parliament, then the  price

to  be  paid is to contest in the elections.  Win the  election,

and then they can be in Parliament and, hopefully, contribute to

the debates in this Parliament.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they do not want to, we have the NMP scheme and it has found

a  way  for people, to contribute to public policy discourse  in

Parliament.  But that does not mean that if other people want to

make  their  views  heard and do not want to be  in  Parliament,

there  is no place at all to make their views heard.  There  are

many  channels which I will elaborate.  In fact, the two Members

have  talked  about  how people who want to  comment  on  public

policy could do so earlier on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a price. In fact, there is even a price for the

electorate for that matter.  If the electorate really feels that

there is a strong demand for some voices to be heard which  will

be  a counter to what the Government would do or that Government

policies were not to their liking, then the price they pay would

be to vote in the opposition.  Then they would have a new party,

new  government, and that is it.  If they do not want to pay too

much of a price, then they vote in some Opposition Members.  But

I  think it is very difficult for the electorate to arrange  for

that.   So,  happily, the PAP has been elected time  and  again,

because  the  people really want the PAP to be  the  government,

although  they  do  want some Opposition voices  in  Parliament.

That  is how Mr Jeyaretnam found his way into Parliament because

of  some  unhappiness at that time in Anson, and we  had  Potong

Pasir and subsequently at other places.  And today, we are  back

to  two  elected Opposition Members.  I think people  knew  what

elected Opposition Members can really do in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Rai rightly also observed that we have built up a

political system that is honest and free from corruption.  But I

think we should not forget that this was not the situation  that

prevailed  in  Singapore in the 1950s or even up  to  the  early

1960s.  I remember, as a young boy, I followed my mother to  the

Siong Lim market in Jalan Besar.  My mother used to tell me that

if  a hawker inspector in the 1950s needed food provisions, then

all  that  person needed to do was to drive his car to the  back

lane of the market, leave his car unlocked and come back to find

his car filled with provisions and his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>

marketing  needs for the week.  That was how it was.  Corruption

was  rife  from  the  top and all the way down  to  very  junior

officials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have more or less, in fact, I would say almost, eradicated

this problem.  But if we look around us, I think it seems to  be

quite natural to have corruption.  And here in Singapore, we are

lucky  that we have worked at it and made sure that this  system

does  not  prevail and we must continue to work hard to preserve

this value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai is also right to say that it is not the Constitution or

any  law  that  determines  the  success  of  our  parliamentary

democracy.   Indeed,  it  is not any law  or  constitution  that

determines  the  success of any institution.   It  is  not  just

Parliament.   We  need  people  who  are  honest,  people   with

integrity, people with the nation's interest at heart, in  order

to make sure that we have a good and clean system.  So no number

of  independent commissions of inquiry or independent council or

Ombudsman  will  make sure that we will have a good,  clean  and

corrupt-free system.  No, not at all.  But if the Workers' Party

were  to be in charge today, I think we would have lots of that.

Unfortunately, Mr Jeyaretnam is not here to hear this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our system, we recognise people with ability. In this

meritocratic  system,   we  reward  them  according   to   their

performance and they get promoted and hence they move  up.   And

that  is the social ladder that we provide for all Singaporeans,

ie, the equal opportunity that we provide in our system, and  we

have  done that.  We have seen many examples of people who  have

moved  up  from the lower rungs of society to high positions  in

Government  or  in the private sector.  I think there  are  also

many  examples of these people in this House.  So I  think  this

system has worked and we must ensure that it continues to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai said that the younger generation of Singaporeans may want

to  emulate the Western style of democracy.  Well, I  have  just

recounted some examples of how some restless electorate wants to

see an Opposition in Parliament.  But I think

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>

most  Singaporeans are sensible.  They are rational.  They  know

what it is at stake and what is in their interest.  And that  is

why  even  though they may want to have heated debates  in  this

House,  they  know that they cannot just have  people  here  who

would criticise or make comments without really contributing  to

the formulation of good policies.  But during an election rally,

I  am  sure Members know that in the last election, for example,

thousands  of people turned up at election rallies to listen  to

the Opposition attack and criticise the Government, poked fun at

the Government, our policies and so on.  I think the people just

lapped  it  up.   They  enjoyed it.   They  went  there  for  an

entertainment  and at the end of the day, when they  cast  their

vote, they know what is at stake when they give that vote to the

person whom they voted for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That reminds me of another part of my young childhood. I used

to  enjoy going to the street corner and watch at the koyok man,

the Chinese medicine man, showing off his skills like swallowing

steel  ball-bearings.  Or he may have an iron rod  to  poke  his

neck until it bends, and he also carried a drum.  At the end  of

the  day, he would say, "This is my koyok.   This is my medicine

that can really make you feel good.  And if something happens to

you,  this can be a palliative to your problems."  I think  many

people  went  there for a good show, enjoyed  it  and  some  may

sympathise with the guy because he would pass his hat round  and

they  would  just  drop some coins in there.   And  some  people

actually bought that story and bought the koyok.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is like election rallies. People turned up at election

rallies,  listened to the speeches, enjoyed and lapped them  up.

They went home, quite happy, but when they cast their vote, they

did  not buy that story.  But still, about a quarter, maybe 30%,

maybe  more in some cases, of those people who turned  up  there

bought  that  story.   They  did buy that  koyok  of  Opposition

speakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai, Dr Lee and Mr Sin Boon Ann talked about the various

channels that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>

have  opened up in the last many years to allow people to  speak

up  and  to contribute to our nation building, to contribute  to

our  policy formulation and so on.  Indeed, there have been many

such mechanisms and channels and we can, of course, open up more

if  people want it.  And the latest one is the S21 Committee  in

which two Members here are actively participating and others too

have  been  asked whether they have views and whether there  are

people  who may have views and who may be interested  in  taking

part  in  the  dialogues.  And all these  channels  are  outside

Parliament  and certainly people are most welcome  to  give  all

their  views.  During the 1985 recession, we formed an  Economic

Committee  in 1986 to look into the measures that we  needed  to

take  and  to devise a new economic strategy for Singapore,  and

many  Singaporeans took part in it.  Now, we also have a similar

committee   and  again  a  lot  of  Singaporeans  are  involved.

Similarly,  the various committees and councils we have  had  in

1988, 1989, 1991, for example, to write up the Agenda for Action

or The Next Lap or the various Advisory Councils' Reports on the

Aged, on Youth, on Culture, etc, have involved lots and lots  of

Singaporeans.  And those were not just reports studied and filed

away, and left to dry on the shelf.   They were reports prepared

by  earnest  and  serious  people who had  spent  time  and  the

Government  had also spent a lot of time going through  each  of

the  recommendations.   Eventually, when  these  recommendations

were  adopted, we spent money implementing them.   And,  indeed,

today,  you  see the results of many of these suggestions  which

have been implemented by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as the Prime Minister said last year, he wanted more

Singaporeans to participate and there are channels for  them  to

do  so.  Mr Rai has quoted the Prime Minister and I shall not go

into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these measures that we have taken are really for the

good  governance of Singapore.  I do not agree with Mr Rai  when

he said that we have been subjected to heavy criticisms from the

Western  press  or media on our system of governance.   I  think

not.   Indeed, they have praised us, not that we need the praise

or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>

we want the praise in order to do a good job.  But people looked

at  our system when they came here, and they went away and  say,

"Yes,  this  is a serious place.  This is a place  where  people

make  decisions  based on rational arguments and they  implement

what  they  say."   So  they went away and said  the  system  of

governance  here  is correct and I think we should  continue  to

uphold the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of whether there is an opposition in Parliament

or not, the PAP Government will continue to devise policies with

the  interest of the people at heart.  It is not a  question  of

staying  in  power.  If it is so, we will not have  devised  the

Elected  President  system, for example,  to  check  our  power.

Where  in the world can you find a ruling Government devising  a

system  to  check  its own power?  But we  did  it,  because  we

believe  that  it is in the interest of Singaporeans  that,  who

knows,  some  day  a profligate government may be  elected  into

power  and  it just squanders away all the hard earned  reserves

that we have accumulated over the years.  So we should now start

a  process to ensure that the reserves that we have would not be

squandered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai quoted the example of the judiciary system and asked

us to take a leaf from it.  He said that since the judiciary has

evolved  and  been  made  less adversarial,  it  has  been  more

consultative  and it allows mediation and conciliation,  and  so

on,  Parliament  should follow suit.  I think  there  is  a  big

difference  between what the judiciary does and what  Parliament

does.   What the judiciary does is that it settles disputes  for

parties.   If  there is no dispute between parties, then  nobody

needs  to  go to the courts.   But because there is  a  dispute,

whether it is a dispute between an individual and an individual,

or an individual against a corporation, or a corporation against

a  corporation,  or even a corporation against  the  Government,

they need a third party to help settle the dispute.  Before they

eventually   go  to  court,  they  get  into   a    process   of

consultation, mediation or conciliation on the points that  they

agree, and the parts for which they cannot agree, the judge will

listen  to  both  sides  of the story and  eventually  give  his

decision and verdict.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the role of Parliament and the role of the Government are

very  different.  It is a not a question of dispute between  the

opposition  and  the PAP.  It is a question  of  the  Government

setting  out  policies and implementing them, or the  Government

presenting Bills to be passed in Parliament into law and  having

a  full debate of these, and eventually the legislature decides,

"Yes, that is the kind of law we should have".  Parliament votes

on  the  Bills, and we implement them, and the court  will  then

interpret those laws.  At the end of the term, it is the  people

who  will decide whether this Government has done well  or  not.

It  is  not  for Mr Speaker or Mr Deputy Speaker to  say,  "Good

policy.  I approve or disapprove, or I reject it, or this is  my

decision."   No.   It is for the people.  The people  will  give

that verdict.  So it is very different from the judiciary and we

therefore   cannot  emulate  the  judiciary   in   following   a

consultative, mediatory, conciliatory approach to our  disputes.

Because  that  is actually not a dispute between the  Government

and  the  opposition.   It is a question of  different  policies

which I will touch on afterwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in our Parliament, the way we have conducted our

business  has  been well reported.  Not that  we  need  to  seek

accolades,  but  Members  may have  read  of  these  reports  by

consultants and other international agencies.  My colleague, the

Minister  of  State  quoted PERC, IMD, WEF Reports,  etc.   They

speak  very well of our Parliament. I would not want to take  up

too  much  of  Members'  time but let me just  quote  one  short

passage from what PERC said in their survey in July last year:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The standard of debate [ie, in Parliament] is arguably

much  better than in many countries in Asia.  In fact, by rating

the  Singapore  legislature as the  best   in  the  region,  the

respondents [these are businessmen] in our survey appear  to  be

saying  that  these  factors [earlier on it talked  about  other

factors such as the quality of the police and the quality of our

judiciary] were more important to them than the lack of a strong

opposition able to act as a check on the government.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sometimes, PAP backbenchers also play the role of a de

facto  political opposition, bringing up issues  that  in  other

countries  would fall more naturally within the purview  of  the

government's opponents.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is said of this House. So we conduct our

business  in  a  dignified  and  business-like  manner  and   in

seriousness, not one where, as the Member has observed in  other

countries, slippers, shoes, or even water guns are being  thrown

or fired at one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai specifically talked about the contempt or public

perception that some PAP Members have on the opposition.   I  do

not  agree with that.  We cannot give respect to a person unless

that person really earns it.  So respect has to be earned.   Has

success  got  into our heads or not, just because we  have  been

returned  overwhelmingly by the people?   I  think  not.   After

every general election, the Prime Minister will invariably  send

a  letter  to  all the PAP MPs (he is responsible only  for  PAP

MPs),  and  he  will remind them of what their  responsibilities

are.   Let me quote from a letter which he wrote to all the  PAP

MPs  on  9th January 1997 after the last general elections.   He

said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Victory must not go into our heads. The responsibilities

we  have  to  shoulder  require us to be humble,  not  arrogant.

Reach  out to all your constituents, work hard to win over those

who  did  not  support you this time.  Seek to understand  their

aspirations  and  their  difficulties.  Address  their  concerns

where  you can and meet their needs for better local facilities.

Consolidate  your  position by working harder  and  winning  the

confidence and trust.  Start working now.  For the next  general

election in 2002, use the next five years to show what we can do

to make our people's lives better.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all our PAP MPs know their responsibilities. In fact,

we  have always told the people and even the opposition that  we

do  not just prepare for the next election just before or during

the nine days of the campaign.  We prepare for the next election

the very day we win our last general election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai suggested that one way to help us evolve into a less

adversarial   Parliament  is  to  consult  the   opposition   in

Parliament  whenever  major policies are discussed.   I  do  not

agree with that.  I will tell him why. Parliament is not a forum

or  a  conference  room  where we host seminars  and  dialogues.

There  we  can  exchange  views.  We can  have  IPS,  Roundtable

discussions,  Socrates' Circle, or we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>

can  have  "Time  Square  Society",  whatever  it  is  for  such

purposes.   But  Parliament is not this  kind  of  organisation.

Parliament is a serious place.  It is a place where MPs who  are

elected  by the people come and contribute to policy making  and

for them to scrutinise the policies.  These include the PAP MPs.

They  will  scrutinise Government policies and  make  sure  that

these policies are good for the people and the nation and in our

interest.  After winning every election, the party in power,  in

this case the PAP, will put forth its policies and programmes to

seek the support of the legislature so that eventually when they

are implemented, it will win again at the next election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the role of the opposition here? The role of the

opposition  in  Parliament will be to  poke  holes,  maybe  even

worse, to criticise and to tear down all these policies that  we

want  to implement, or even to question the very need for  these

policies.  That is their role.  They will attack us.  If they do

not  do their job, and if they support us, reach consensus  with

us,  then  they are not  the opposition.  So the very nature  of

party  politics that we have inherited, even so in Britain  now,

will  ensure that the proceedings in this House will  always  be

adversarial.   There is no running away from that.   We  can  be

civil.  But civil does not mean that we will not be adversarial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if Members look back at the Hansard in the 50s and early

60s  when  we had an opposition, there were far more  bickerings

and  noisy and nasty debates in this House.  As Mr Rai said, the

opposition,  even  till  today, will  oppose  for  the  sake  of

opposition, not just because the policy is no good, but even  if

the  policy  is good, it will also oppose it.  So  there  is  no

reason  why the PAP Government should consult the opposition  in

this House whenever we discuss our policies.  The only place and

time  to  really debate policies is when the House  debates  the

Bills,  motions  or  statements.  Then both sides  can  properly

scrutinise these statements or policies and argue their case and

try  to  convince  each other, if not, at  least  definitely  to

convince the electorate that "my view is better than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>

yours".  That is the nature of party politics.  There is no  way

that we can avoid being adversarial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, even if we want to consult them, I do not think

there is much that we can get out of them because they are  just

bereft  of  ideas.  We heard more than an hour of Mr  Jeyaretnam

raking up an old issue.  He was so predictable.  If you listened

to Prof. Ho Peng Kee, you know that he has got a speech prepared

and  all  the  points that Mr Jeyaretnam brought  up  have  been

anticipated.   He was so predictable that we know  what  he  was

going to say.  So there were no surprises.  What is new from the

opposition?  We know that there would not be anything new.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, should we only consult the three opposition Members

here,  or  two  elected  ones?  Should we?  Are  they  the  only

opposition voices in Singapore?  Certainly not.  Because we have

the  PKMS, the SDP, the NSP and many others. Since they are also

the  opposition,  should the Government also not  consult  these

opposition  parties in order to carry consensus seeking  to  the

extreme?   It  seems logical to do so.  But I do  not  think  we

should  do  so.  Because, in the first place, these people  have

not  earned their place here.  Secondly, even when they are  out

there,  I do not think they can even look after themselves.  For

example, where is the SDP now?  They had three Members  in  this

House before the last election.  Two were not re-elected because

their  performance in the previous five years had shown up their

performance  in  this House as well as in their  constituencies.

Mr  Chiam left the SDP long before the election and today he  is

still  here,  of  course,  but  he has  another  party,  another

platform, another organisation.  But what about the rest?   Some

cannot  even  look  after their own affairs,  what  about  being

consulted  on national affairs.  I think it is not fair  to  put

that burden on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if there are any contributions or improvements to

be  made  to policies, the opposition should make them  here  in

this  House.  Then we can debate and reach the best conclusions.

If their views are constructive, useful and relevant, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>

Government  will  acknowledge, accept and implement  them.   But

most  of the time, I would say practically all the time, we will

not  find  a  shred of it that is useful.  Some of them  may  be

helpful  in  setting us thinking about how to overcome  some  of

their  problems or some of their objections.   But we know  that

they  have  not got the slightest idea as to how  to  make  this

place  better.  I also do not think the opposition parties  will

help  reach consensus in this House.  Because, by doing so, they

come to agreement with us, and they will diminish their role and

the  electorate will say, "No use having the opposition  because

they always agree with the PAP."  What about the PAP?  Supposing

the PAP were to agree with the opposition all the time, then the

people will say, "Why do we need the PAP?  I might as well  vote

for  the opposition."  But let me assure Members that that would

not be the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if we have a debate on, say, a Bill that goes to a

Select Committee, I think the proceedings of those debates  will

be  less adversarial, which opposition MPs and even PAP MPs will

concede, because they are outside for the scrutiny of the public

and  the media.  But the moment we have the public sitting  here

in  the gallery and the press reporting this event, I think both

sides,  the  opposition  and  the Government,  will  give  their

contending views and eventually try to convince the public  that

their  view is much better.  This is what party politics is  all

about.   It is inherent in our system because different  parties

have  different ideas, different ideals, different policies  and

different  programmes.  Indeed, if they are not different,  then

there  will  be  no party politics to speak of.  The  layout  of

these seats, for example, already shows that we are adversarial.

Now,  of  course, I do not want to be adversarial with  you  but

that is the origin of it.  It is adversarial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards other suggestions by Mr Rai to enlarge the NCMP

scheme  or  have  some percentage of this House  be  elected  by

proportional  representation, I think  they  are  not  workable,

especially  if  his  intention is to  have  a  less  adversarial

Parliament.   Just one example of an NCMP, we know  that  it  is

already very adversarial.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>

Imagine  if we have more NCMPs in this House, I think  the  mood

and atmosphere in this House will be much more adversarial.   If

we  were  to  have a percentage of our MPs here  represented  on

proportional representation, I think that will also not be  good

for  us.   Why?  Because then different cause parties, different

interest  groups,  different segments of the society  will  then

form  parties  to appeal to a certain segment of the  people  in

order  to  be elected in this House.  This will then  spawn  all

kinds  of  groups and groupings that would not be good  for  the

interest  of  our  nation.  So we should not  tinker  with  this

electoral  system that we now have.  In fact, if I look  at  the

contributions  made  by NMPs and the way they  debate  policies,

even if they do not agree with the Government, I think they  are

very  constructive  and very useful.  It is  a  lesson  for  the

Opposition.  With their presence, I see really very little  need

for NCMPs to be here to contribute to the debate in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, while I note Mr Rai's honourable intention

to  make  this House less adversarial, I do not agree  with  his

proposals,  particularly  the ones that  he  suggested  that  we

consult the Opposition or to enlarge the NCMP scheme or to  have

proportional representation, because these will do us no good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not support his motion in that respect. I cannot just

vote  partly for it and the other part against it.  I  say  that

just in case, and lest that people in future look at the Hansard

think  that  we should evolve that way and be less  adversarial.

Let  us  not be misunderstood.  We simply do not agree with  his

approach.  It would not happen.  The lesson from the British  is

that  they  have  been talking about having a  less  adversarial

system  for  years.   I  went to ask the Librarian  to  help  me

research some articles.  There were piles of articles written on

the  British  Parliament and how it is doing and how  it  serves

people's   interests  and  whether  it  should   not   be   less

adversarial, etc.  Till today, after years of debate, they  have

not come to a consensus.  I do not think they will.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Parliament, indeed, the Government will continue with

its  consultation,  consensus building  process  to  get  views,

canvass  views,  feedback, suggestions, ideas from  Singaporeans

who  want to contribute through various means, incorporate  them

wherever  possible,  feasible, practicable,  and  we  will  also

continue  to  co-opt individuals to serve in the Government,  in

the statutory boards, in our committees, in our councils, and so

on,  so  that  these people can also take part in the  decision-making process of the Government.  One does not have to be  part

of  Government but one can be, as a private individual,  sit  in

our  statutory  boards,  in our Economic Committees,  etc.,  and

one's  views  will  still  be valued.  So  the  Government  will

continue  to do that.  But while the Prime Minister  has  talked

about  a consultative, participative process, let us not  forget

that  when the time comes to make firm decisions because of  the

urgency  of  the  matter,  because of  the  peculiarity  of  the

subject,  the  Government will not hesitate to make  these  firm

decisions without consultation with the people.  I think that is

the  duty  of  the Government, that is, to decide  in  the  best

interest  of the people and when there is no time, we just  have

to  do  it, and we will do it.  In fact, that is what the people

expect of a strong, just and fair Government, which is what  the

PAP is all about during the last few decades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of the effectiveness of this Government really, as Mr

Rai  suggested, is whether it has improved the living  standards

of  the  people,  whether it has improved life for  the  people.

Whether  Government has done well or not depends on whether  its

policies  are  good for the people, and the people will  decide.

Indeed, the people decided, election after election, since  1959

that what the PAP Government did, and is doing, for them is good

for them.  And that is why we are here.  Singaporeans indeed can

be  and  are justifiably proud of the achievements of Singapore,

despite  our  size,  and Singapore does  stand  tall  among  the

community of nations.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, concepts such as consultation,

consensus, conciliation - I heard a lot of it today -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>

are good words essentially, so is the objective to evolve a less

adversarial parliamentary system a desirable political end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it a goal which everyone agrees on? For some, this

motion  may  be irrelevant because they regard Parliament  as  a

venue for vigorous debate, where adversarial relationships  are,

in  fact, healthy.  Others may believe that the evolution  of  a

political   system  should  create  a  broad  middle-ground   of

Singaporeans  sharing  common political views  than  adversarial

ones,  leading  naturally to the adoption of a less  adversarial

parliamentary system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever is the preferred approach, and I see both approaches

here, when differences of opinions do intensify and conflict  is

impending  on a particular policy, it is the government  of  the

day  which makes the final decision.  So whether we have a  more

adversarial  or  more consensual parliamentary system,  when  it

comes  to  the  crunch, the ruling Party  -  manifested  by  the

Government - will call the shots.  This, to me, is obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I see the substance behind this motion is not about

changes  in the parliamentary system.  It is a call for  greater

tolerance  for  different,  and  even  opposing,  views   during

parliamentary debate.  Of course, there are areas of improvement

which  can  make  this  House a more vibrant  venue  for  policy

discourse.  I remember Dr Lily Neo in one interview said  a  lot

of  consultation  and implementation, checks  and  feedback  are

carried  outside  of this House, not within this  House.   So  I

think  this  call for tolerance requires all political  parties,

big  or small, mainstream or opposition, to create space for one

another,  and  to  express  their  views  freely,  and  adopt  a

"gentlemanly" (maybe I should say here "lady-like") attitude  to

agree  to disagree without one having to be right and the  other

to  be  wrong.  We need to recognise the world is not just black

or white, but mainly shades of grey.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this consultation achieved? While there are numerous

dialogues between the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>

Government    and   the   electorate,   increasingly    educated

Singaporeans wish to be included in the conceptualisation  stage

before  a  policy  is decided.  Too often, a policy  is  already

decided  and  feedback sessions are perceived  as  just  rubber-stamping sessions.  Consultation is thus often limited to  minor

tinkering,  with no consideration for views which  may  be  more

fundamentally different.  But I agree that I have seen  the  MPs

here  work very hard in their constituencies.  They gather  hard

facts  and manage grassroots inputs in a very pragmatic fashion.

I  am  sure,  some  of them even meander policy constraints  and

bureaucratic  politics and manage grassroots issues  in  a  very

effective way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a joke that consensus is when you agree with me.

If  we are to achieve true consensus, we must recognise that  it

takes  a  lot of time as opposing positions have to be discussed

and  re-discussed until all parties slowly grope  and  gravitate

towards a true consensus.  The process is as significant as  the

goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the goals of consultation, consensus and

conciliation  are based on values which are already  traditional

to  our  societies.   Consensus can only be achieved  where  the

frame  of  reference  is based on communitarian  needs  and  the

spirit  of compromise.  This basically means that the individual

is  important  as  part of a group or society  rather  than  the

notion  that  the individual is the centrepiece  of  all  social

actions.   I believe that, in Singapore, these values have  been

entrenched   and   therefore  we   do   have   the   fundamental

prerequisites of a consensual society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would caution here though that we must not use consensual

politics  to discourage open debate and dissent.  The Government

and  all  MPs  must constantly ask ourselves: are  our  dominant

values  and  institutions truly representative of the  society's

views?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs are tasked to identify the issues of convergence and

conflict of Singaporeans and to present their divergent views to

this House.  It is interesting to note that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>

Minister  earlier  on said that party politics  is  by  function

necessarily  adversarial.  But our MP, Dr Tan Cheng  Bock,  said

MPs of this House are not.  The process of arriving at these two

different conclusions, I think, is worthy of reflection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the attitude of agreeing to disagree without

fear of being reprimanded or sanctioned has to be nurtured if we

are  to  give  our  younger MPs the confidence  to  broaden  the

political  agenda  and  the  boundaries  of  expressions,   thus

enabling  them  to  safely  flex and test  their  own  political

muscles within Parliament and outside this House.  Singapore  in

the  next  century  needs PAP leaders who  are  good  listeners,

nimble   thinkers,   persuasive  communicators   and   effective

grassroots networkers.  Such leadership is only honed  by  years

of  internship in consultation and conciliation skills to  reach

consensus  among  contending stakeholders  in  and  outside  the

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the idea of increasing the role of Government

Parliamentary  Committees to reach out to  a  wider  network  of

Singaporeans   and   truly  nurture  the  channels   of   policy

articulation and feedback inputs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a less adversarial stance must begin, first, by Members in

this  House  adopting specific norms of collaboration.   In  the

workshop which I chaired on "voluntarism and professionalism" in

IPS Civil Society seminar, we captured the norms of consultation

in  an  acronym called IDEA.  That was in response to  BG  Yeo's

call  for  Singapore  idea.  The "I" stands for  Information  to

actors  involved; "D" for Dialogue between state and  community;

"E"  for  Enablement  characterised by a culture  of  initiative

which the state must facilitate and nurture; and lastly, "A" for

Access to state agencies and resources.  These norms are for  me

essential in our effort to harness State-society synergy in this

House  and  outside of this Parliament to avoid  confrontational

politics  and  strengthen  civic  engagement  towards  goals  of

consultation, consensus and conciliation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is late

into the day, so let me make it short.

First,  I  disagree with Mr Rai on the proposal to have  a  less

adversarial parliamentary system because I believe it is in  the

nature  of Parliament to be engaging, in fact, adversarial.   It

is  through passionate debate, clashes of ideas, that out of  it

may merge a decision that I think is in the best interest of the

majority  of our population.  However, I support and agree  with

Mr  Rai  that the system of government and stance must  and  can

certainly  embody  the  values  of consultation,  consensus  and

conciliation, and tolerance, as stated by Mdm Claire Chiang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Shriniwas Rai for his references to

encouragement  of  Roundtable which is  a  citizen  non-partisan

policy  discussion group.  On behalf of the Roundtable,  let  me

say  in  this  House  that we believe there exist  in  Singapore

opportunities   where  ordinary  citizens  can  participate   in

influencing and shaping national policies.  But this mission  to

have  unrestrained objective and impartial feedback is and  will

always  be a continuous journey.  It is in the nature of  debate

and  discussion,  even amongst members of the  Roundtable,  that

there  will  be disagreements and arguments, both  critical  and

passionate.  Certainly, it takes bold initiative and courage  to

express one's views in public because it is only natural that if

one's  views are made public, rebuttals, even robust  ones,  and

serious engagements are to be expected.  It is a fact and  quite

natural  at  this stage that many Singaporeans have fears  about

expressing their views.  The situation must be improved.  But  I

must  say  that  the environment for expressing one's  views  is

improving.  It would take time, confidence and certainly a clear

conscience,  both on the part of civil societies and Government,

to  nurture  and  develop a friendly and cordial environment  to

achieve  consensus, consultation and conciliation  in  decision-making.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I

just add to the discussion by saying that there is an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>

Islamic saying which says that differences of opinion can  be  a

blessing,  but  not so much the type of differences  of  opinion

that  can tear the society apart.  In fact, what matters is  how

we manage those differences.  So in that context, Sir, I believe

that, yes, there can be more consultation, more conciliation and

even  more  debate.   If adversarial means  that  we  have  less

deliberate  finding of fault or less putting up of motions  that

waste people's time, where hundreds of people have to listen  to

one  hour of old record being played and replayed, then  I  say,

"Let's  be  less  adversarial."  But if it means  a  contest  of

ideas, and if that is understood as being more adversarial, then

I  say,  "Let's be more adversarial" in the sense that  we  have

more  contests of ideas, more exchanges of opinions and  let  us

decide  based on what is constructive and what is good  for  the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that score, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that

this  motion,  of course, has different meanings  for  different

people,  just  as  the  Minister's  understanding  of  us  being

necessarily  adversarial as against Dr Tan Cheng Bock's  opinion

that  we  are  not  adversarial.  I think  the  answer  lies  in

between.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore is basically  a  multi-racial,

multi-cultural and multi-religious vulnerable small  nation.  In

the early days of our nation building, we went through a lot  of

difficulties  and  appeared to face a  very  bleak  prospect  of

survival, because we were not adequately conditioned to stand on

our  own  to  build up the nation.  In spite of that,  Singapore

remains  undaunted  in the face of peril and has  overcome  many

difficulties during the past 33 years of nation building.   That

we  not  only survive, but also grow and prosper, is  definitely

not a mere "economic miracle" as described by the academics,  or

to be taken for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of Singapore is basically due to the fact that

we  have shared and cherished a very fundamental but essentially

important value in the process of nation building, that is,  the

key to survival is racial harmony and national unity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>

Because  of  this common conviction, our people,  regardless  of

race, have been steadfast in giving the present government their

strong support through successive elections under the democratic

parliamentary  electoral  system, notwithstanding  the  numerous

debates  and  trials and tribulations.  This  has  ensured  that

there is sustained political stability  to our country, and that

Government policies and measures can be implemented smoothly  to

achieve   the  desired  results.   This  kind  of  parliamentary

democracy coupled with the shared value of our people  has  been

consistently upheld and realized to the benefit of  our  people,

thereby  strengthening the confidence of  both  our  people  and

foreign investors.  This is the key factor to our success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, racial harmony and national unity

can  only  be  maintained  through close  rapport  and  seamless

cooperation  and  not  adversary or confrontation,  between  the

Government   and  the  people.  The  relationship  between   the

Government  and the people is like that of the lips  and  teeth.

There  is  a Chinese saying, "When the lips are gone, the  teeth

will  be  in  trouble."   Through  the  democratic  process   of

election,  we  give the Government a mandate  and  therefore  we

should  have  full confidence in the Government.   At  the  same

time,  we  must try to understand the rationale of  the  various

Government policies, and give the Government our support for the

proper implementation of such policies.  On the other hand,  the

Government,  acting  under the mandate of the  people,  has  the

obligation to take the trouble to explain the various  important

policies  to  the  people  through Parliament  and  the  various

administrative   channels, with an enlightened and  consultative

attitude.    At  the same time, they should listen open-mindedly

to  the  views  of the people, and make the adjustments  to  the

policies  where necessary taking into consideration the feedback

of  the  people.  In this way, the policies formulated will  not

only  serve  the  interests of the people but  also  have  their

greater  support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 33 years, the Government has accumulated a wealth

of experience in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>

governing the country and, in terms of development strategy,  it

has  always adopted its own unique approach and is full of ideas

in  tackling  major problems and it should value this  important

asset.  Over the years, we can see that the Government is always

full  of confidence and has remained undaunted in the face of  a

crisis,   whenever  an  unpopular  but  necessary    policy   is

implemented  or  some measures have to be taken in  response  to

changes in current situation.  As a result, many people begin to

adopt  the  attitude  of "you do things,  I  am  rest  assured",

thereby leaving everything to the Government and refraining from

actively  participating in discussions with  the  Government  on

national  policies.  To the democratic system  of  our  country,

this is not very encouraging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying: "even the wise are not always free from

errors".  If,  after winning the mandate from  the  people,  the

Government  is to become arrogant and supercilious, refusing  to

listen to the views of the people and bent on having its own way

in  the implementation of national policies, or  wilfully  takes

suppressive  action or rejects diverging views, then  this  will

not  only cause impediment to the implementation of the  policy,

but  also result in the loss of the people's confidence  in  the

Government.  In this way, our spirit of cooperation between  the

political leaders and the people and our strength of unity  will

be  undermined, resulting in crisis and disaster to the country.

I  believe that this is what the Government and the people would

always want to avoid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Shriniwas Rai has mentioned, we have inherited the

parliamentary democracy from the British.  We are also  building

up  or  have  built up on this basis the necessary  changes  and

adjustments  in  keeping with our prevailing  local  conditions,

including  the  introduction  of  the  Elected  Presidency,  the

creation  of  NCMP  and  NMP.   Outside  Parliament,  under  the

leadership  of  our  Prime Minister, the Government  has,  among

others, set up the Feedback Unit and strengthened the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>

communication channels with the grassroots organisations and the

CDCs to enhance the cooperative relationships between the people

and  the  Government.  The Government has also  opened  up  more

communication  channels and conducted several dialogue  sessions

to  gather  feedback from the people on our major  policies  and

development strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have already developed this healthy and sound

parliamentary democracy system and the communication channels to

strengthen   rapport   and  cooperation  better    between   the

Government and the people, why should we discuss this motion  at

all  in  this Parliament?  Are we "moaning and groaning  without

being   ill"  or  entertaining  imaginary  or  groundless  fears

unnecessarily?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Shriniwas Rai moves this motion at a

time when we are being affected by the current financial crisis.

I   think   it   is  well  intentioned.   It  has   far-reaching

significance.   Whether a system is good or bad  may  depend  on

certain objective circumstances.  A good system cannot be  taken

for granted or treated as eternally reliable.  In this turbulent

and  competitive age, the results we have achieved  through  our

past  efforts  can  easily  be wiped out  overnight  because  of

changes  in  circumstances and the prevailing  factors.   If  we

adopt  an  indifferent attitude, we may unwittingly  drift  into

either  of  two extremes:  one where the people are  indifferent

and  apathetic  to Government policies,  leaving everything   to

the   Government,  and  completely  oblivious  of  whether   the

Government  is bent on doing things its own way when formulating

and  implementing new policies; or the other, where  the  people

are   consistently  confrontational  against   the   Government.

Whatever  policy  the Government formulates or implements,  they

will  query and use every possible means to find fault with  the

Government,  and attack it in order to embarrass  and  tear  the

Government apart. If we allow this trend to set in and to  grow,

it  will become a very corruptive social influence and may  mark

the beginning of our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>

decline.  Therefore, we must remain very alert.  In a moment  of

crisis,    we   must  treasure  and  protect  our  parliamentary

democracy system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to prevent our people, particularly the

younger  generation, from moving into either one  of  these  two

extremes,  we should start from Parliament itself to openly  and

frankly  discuss national issues constructively and  extensively

without  being personal and without discrimination.  It is  only

in  this  way  that  we will be able to give full  play  to  the

function of Parliament.  I hope that my parliamentary colleagues

will  do  their homework to reflect the views of the people  and

give   their  constructive  criticisms  so  as  to  ensure  that

Government policies can be better formulated and implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I also hope that the Ministers themselves

will  have more patience in listening to the views of MPs.  When

answering questions, although  the Ministers cannot be  expected

to  concede  to  all  our requests, they  should  at  least   be

receptive   and   tolerant  to  the  more  critical   views   or

constructive  suggestions which they might find it difficult  to

accept  at  the outset.  I hope the Ministers can   become  more

magnanimous  and give due consideration to such suggestions  put

forward  by  the  MPs or ask the officials in  their  ministries

concerned to look into the suggestions and adopt those which are

later  considered necessary and appropriate.  There is a  saying

that  good  advice  is jarring  the ears.   The  Ministers  must

always  bear this in mind in listening to the people  for  their

views and adopting their suggestions, when appropriate, so as to

ensure smooth implementation of Government policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Parliament, the Government has spared no effort in

promoting  its  rapport  and  cooperation  with  the  grassroots

organisations.   As  regards other  civic  bodies  such  as  the

industrial  and  commercial  organisations,  I  hope  that   the

Government  should also treat them with equal  importance.   The

Government should try to open up more communication channels  to

provide more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>

opportunities  for  greater interaction and cooperation  between

the Government and the business community.  In terms of economic

development,  I  would  appeal to the  Government  to  give  the

business  community more substantive participatory opportunities

so  as  to adopt a more united and cooperative approach  to  the

issues  at hand.  This will encourage the business community  to

make  greater  contributions to our economic development.   With

this  in  mind, it will be a positive step on the  part  of  the

Government to hold dialogue sessions with the business community

before  the Budget is formulated every year, to listen to  their

problems and views to ensure that when the Budget is formulated,

it  will  take  into consideration the inputs  of  the  business

community, thereby earning their unreserved support.  I hope the

Government can seriously consider this suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in principle.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I assure you that I

will be very brief.  I know that it is past dinner time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am grateful to Members who have spoken. Whether

they  agree  or disagree, it is another matter.  The  fact  that

they  have  expressed  their opinions,  I  think,  is  the  most

important issue.  In keeping with the tradition of the  contents

of  the  motion,  I have decided, in consultation with my  other

colleagues,  to amend the motion.  I would like  to  delete  the

words, "less adversarial".  Sir, the motion would now read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House recognises the need to evolve a

parliamentary system which will further strengthen  the  process

of consultation, consensus and conciliation.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Rai, could you please put it down on

paper?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I have written it down, Sir. May I pass

it to you?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It would mean another debate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I have the liberty to amend my

motion at this stage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Which means that the House has to debate

it again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I hope Members would not want to

debate the motion again.  Perhaps we should listen to the Leader

of the House first.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes. Mr Wong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, in the spirit of consensus seeking,

Mr Rai has shown me a note of his intention to amend his motion.

Again, do not consider me as an adversary if I disagree with him

this  time  round.  Because his motion reads, "That  this  House

recognises  the  need  to  evolve a parliamentary  system  [even

without  those  words  that he wanted to take  out]  which  will

further  strengthen the process of consultation,  consensus  and

conciliation."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I do not see Parliament having a need to evolve

such a system.  As I have explained, this Parliament is for  the

Opposition   and  the  ruling  party  to  debate  policies   and

programmes  openly  so that each side can present  their  ideas,

programmes and policies so that they can win the next  election.

The  contention between political parties is unavoidable.   That

is  why  Parliament  is  adversarial.  There  may  be  different

degrees  of  being adversaries.  Whether Dr Tan  Cheng  Bock  is

right or I am right, it does not really matter.  What matters is

that  in this system that we have, it is necessarily adversarial

because different political parties will have different policies

and  we must disagree.  Even if we agree to disagree, we can  do

it civilly no doubt.  But since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



political  parties are there to win elections and  to  form  the

government, they would take their respective position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as other views are concerned, the way we should

conduct our business, I agree, yes, we can be civil, we  can  be

consultative, we can be consensus seeking and indeed, as I  have

noticed  that  many of the MPs who spoke up were actually  NMPs.

And the Opposition is conspicuously absent.  Not a single one is

here!   I  do  not know whether it indicates that  they  do  not

support Mr Rai's motion or they simply voted with their feet.  I

will leave it to you to draw the conclusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whatever it is, whatever amendment that Mr Rai would like to

make,  particularly the one that he talked about, and his  whole

motion  starts  off  with  recognising  the  need  to  be   less

adversarial, that I cannot support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Rai, you have the floor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I think I have achieved my objective. I

have  listened to the Leader.  I think there is only one  course

of  action  for me to take.  I have consulted my colleagues.   I

will  not take any further time of the House and I beg leave  to

withdraw the motion.  [Applause].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics on the number of cyclists killed or injured by motor

1992-1997. On average, 15 cyclists were killed and 17  seriously

injured each year in road accidents (see details below).

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bicycle is currently already classified as a vehicle under the

Road  Traffic Act, and bicycle riders are deemed to  be  vehicle

drivers.    Under  both  Road Traffic  and  Pedestrian  Crossing

Rules,  it  is  an offence to cycle on a footway  or  pedestrian

crossing.    Anyone  above the age of  seven  who  cycles  on  a

footway  or  pedestrian crossing can be fined up  to  $1,000  or

jailed up to 3 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of pedestrians seriously injured by cyclists on

pedestrian  walkways  is negligible, with most  sustaining  only

minor  injuries.  However, it is still an offence  to  cycle  on

pedestrian walkways as there is a possibility of injury to  both

cyclists  and  pedestrians arising from collisions.   Those  who

cycle  for  recreational purposes should go to designated  parks

where  bicycle tracks are available.  Those who cycle  on  roads

have to obey traffic rules, like any motorist.

<div align="center"><b>ASSESSMENT OF INDONESIA'S POLITICAL SITUATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Prime Minister (a) what

is  the  Government's assessment of the political  situation  in

Indonesia  and how it could affect the stability of the  region;

and  (b)  what is the response of the Government in  preparation

for the likely scenario.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof S. Jayakumar (for the Prime Minister):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The situation in Indonesia is calmer after two weeks of

unrest.  President Soeharto resigned on the morning of  Thursday

21st  May 1998. This statesmanlike step was the final act of  32

years   of   service  to  his  country.   President   Soeharto's

achievements,  both in Indonesia and the region, were  many  and

distinguished.  They will not be forgotten.  In accordance  with

the  Indonesian  Constitution, Vice President  Dr  B  J  Habibie

succeeded President Soeharto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of office in Indonesia was accomplished peaceably

and  constitutionally.  President Habibie has said that he would

implement political and economic reforms.  The Indonesian people

will decide on the nature, pace and direction of their political

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 22nd May 1998, President Habibie announced his new Reform

Development   Cabinet.   He  has  retained  respected   economic

ministers, led by Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and

Industry  Dr  Ginandjar  Kartasasmita.  President  Habibie  also

declared his commitment to the programme of reforms agreed  with

the  IMF.  The World Bank and the IMF have responded positively.

We  hope  that this will encourage an early return of confidence

in the Indonesian economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia's Government faces many challenges. Expectations of

political  and  economic  reforms are  high.   The  new  Cabinet

recognises  that  its  immediate goal is  social  and  political

stability  to  achieve economic recovery.  The  country's  large

private debt is now estimated at about US$80 billion.   Problems

of  inflation,  unemployment, the difficulty of  trade  and  the

reconstruction  of the banking system must also be  dealt  with.

Indonesia must also repair supply and distribution networks that

were  disrupted in the recent unrest, so as to ensure  a  steady

supply  of essential goods.  The new Government will come  under

intense pressure to resolve the economic problems quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish President Habibie and his new Government success in

dealing  with the tough challenges facing Indonesia  today.   We

hope  that he will succeed in restoring political certainty  and

confidence, the pre-requisites of economic recovery.   A  stable

and  prosperous  Indonesia  will  contribute  significantly   to

regional  stability. Indonesia has been a key  player  in  ASEAN

since  its inception.  It has contributed greatly to the  steady

and  peaceful  development  of ASEAN.   We  are  confident  that

Indonesia will continue to do so for a long time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Though Indonesia is in political transition, relations

between  Singapore  and Indonesia remain good.   Singapore  will

continue  to  work with Indonesia, both bilaterally  and  within

ASEAN,  to further strengthen our close relations to the benefit

of  both  countries.   As Members were told earlier,   Singapore

will  assist Indonesia with its proposed bilateral trade finance

guarantee scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for humanitarian assistance to Indonesia, as Members know,

the  Singapore Red Cross has launched a campaign  to  raise  S$5

million  on 24th March 1998.  As of 23rd May 1998 it has already

raised S$1.8 million.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister, in

view of the current situation in Indonesia, whether the exposure

of  the  Singapore banks has increased, and, if so,  whether  he

could provide the House the extent of this exposure.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30th April 1998, the 6 local banking groups had loans and

investments  amounting  to $3.9 billion  (1.6%  of  their  total

assets) in Indonesia. This is $1.5 billion or 28% lower than  it

was in December 1997.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local banks, in consultation with MAS, had in 1997 set aside

substantial  provisions to cater to the potential risks  arising

from   their  exposure  to  the  regional  economies,  including

Indonesia.  In  view of the current situation in Indonesia,  the

local  banks have indicated that they would set aside additional

provision in 1998 for their exposure to Indonesia.

<div align="center"><b>CREATION OF NEW JOBS THROUGH NEW INVESTMENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  what  types  of new jobs will be created  through  new

investments  and whether they will match the many  workers  that

are expected to be retrenched this year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New jobs created through new investments will generally not

match jobs lost.  This is to be expected as the new jobs tend to

be  of  higher  value added requiring higher  level  of  skills.

Majority of jobs lost are in labour intensive low skill areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new investments coming on stream include wafer fab,

pharmaceutical,     petrochemical,    telecommunications     and

electronics  for  the  manufacturing  sector,  sizeable   public

projects  in the construction sector, as well as investments  in

manufacturing-related services such as logistics  and  IT.   The

$8.5   billion   fixed  asset  investments  committed   in   the

manufacturing sector last year was expected to generate close to

20,000  new  high  value added jobs over  the  next  few  years.

Overall,  we  expect job creation to be relatively  stronger  in

manufacturing, construction, communications, and weaker  in  the

commerce, business and financial services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of skill level, feedback and surveys conducted by

economic  agencies  show that the majority  of  new  investments

require skilled workers with minimum NTC II certification.   For

example,  companies  are  still looking  for  workers  with  NTC

certification in mechanical servicing, precision engineering and

avionics in the engineering area; wafer fab, instrumentation and

computer  technology in the electronics area; process  operation

and control in the petrochemical area.  At a higher skill level,

demand  for  technical and specialised skills remains  sizeable.

The  estimated demand included more than 2,000 engineers,  2,000

diploma holders and 3,000 NTC II holders this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the demand for higher skills and

qualifications in the new jobs, we are faced with a real  danger

of  structural unemployment or job mismatch.  Hence the  urgency

for  re-training and skill upgrading especially  for  the  older

workers.

<div align="center"><b>FUND TO ASSIST PAYMENT OF RETRENCHMENT BENEFITS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Manpower, as

it  is  foreseeable  that more retrenchment exercise  will  take

place,  whether he will consider setting aside a  fund  to  help

companies which have difficulty in paying retrenchment  benefits

to  their  workers,  following  the  practice  of  the  Japanese

government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, companies which retrench workers will pay those

with more than 3-years' service retrenchment benefits, depending

on  their  collective  agreement,  contract  of  employment,  or

industrial  norm  as  well as the company's financial  position.

The  plight  of  the retrenched workers should be  addressed  by

helping  them to secure re-employment as soon as possible.   For

those  who  are  unable to find jobs on their own,  they  should

approach  my Ministry's Employment Service Department (ESD)  for

assistance.   Despite  the slowdown of our  economy,  retrenched

workers should be able to secure alternative employment if  they

are   realistic  in  their  expectations  and  willing  to  make

adjustments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to set up a special fund to help companies which

have  difficulties  in  paying  retrenchment  benefit  to  their

workers is not a sound long-term solution to the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the fund has to be financed through additional taxes

and  levies  and this will increase the costs of doing  business

and  make  it  more  difficult for  companies  to  survive  this

economic  slowdown.  Secondly, it could encourage some employers

to  shed  their  responsibility of having to pay a  retrenchment

benefit  to  the affected workers.  Thirdly, paying retrenchment

benefits on behalf of employers would lead us closer to a system

of unemployment benefits with all its undesirable side-effects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience of countries with welfare system including

unemployment   benefits  has  shown  that  there   are   serious

disadvantages when the state assumes such responsibility.  Apart

from  imposing  a  heavy financial burden on the  taxpayers,  it

provides  workers  with  a false sense of  security,  encourages

prolonged  periods  of  unemployment and reduces  the  sense  of

urgency  in  skill  upgrading. Over time,  it  could  erode  the

positive  work  attitudes  which  are  crucial  for  Singapore's

continued success in economic competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are not leaving retrenched workers including those

who   failed  to  secure  retrenchment  payments  to  fend   for

themselves.   Government has committed $50 million with  another

$50 million from the Skills Development Fund to extend the reach

of   the  Skill  Redevelopment  Programme.   This  programme  is

specifically  targetted at older workers, who  would  face  more

difficulty  getting alternative jobs, to be  retrained  for  new

jobs.   Apart  from paying for the training cost, the  Programme

also  bears  part  of the wage cost of the  worker  when  he  is

undergoing  training.   This will make it  more  attractive  for

other employers to take in these workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore of the view that it will not be in the interest

of  Singapore  to  set  up a retrenchment fund  to  help  ailing

companies pay retrenchment benefit.

<div align="center"><b>TEENAGE PREGNANCY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education what progress has been made in addressing the issue of

rising  teenage  pregnancy and what kind of programmes  will  be

adopted in our school system to enhance sex education among  our

young girls and boys.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Ministry of Health, the number of pregnancies

among  teenagers, defined as those under 20 years  of  age,  has

been  declining over the last few years.  From a total of  2,473

in  1992, the figure fell to 2,091 in 1995.  It went up to 2,185

in 1996.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive action against teenage pregnancy is a shared

responsibility between the teenager, the parents and the school.

The Ministry has set up a committee under the Senior Minister of

State  Dr  Aline  Wong  to look into the  discipline  of  female

pupils.   One of the issues that the committee will  address  is

how  schools can help teenage pupils avoid this problem, as well

as help those who are in that situation cope with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, sex education is not taught as a subject on its

own.   Our  schools  adopt a cross-curricular  approach  to  sex

education  which enables them to teach various  aspects  of  the

topic  according to the maturity of the pupils.  In the  primary

schools, it is taught in Health Education, with the objective of

preparing  pupils  for puberty and early  adolescence.   In  the

secondary schools, it is taught in Science and Civics and  Moral

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant topics in the Science syllabus include sexual

reproduction, birth control, as well as the personal and  social

consequences   of   premarital  sex,  abortion,   and   sexually

transmitted diseases and AIDs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible behaviour and moral values in boy-girl relationships

are  further  reinforced  in Civics and  Moral  Education.   The

Committee on Discipline of Female Pupils will take a closer look

at  how  sex  education  in our schools can  be  delivered  more

effectively for teenage pupils.

<div align="center"><b>PROMOTION OF GOOD PARENTING AND GOOD BEHAVIOUR OF SCHOOL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CHILDREN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Education if his

Ministry will actively promote (a) courtesy, respect and general

good behaviour in primary school children as these values may be

lacking,  especially  in some families where  both  parents  are

working;  and (b) good parenting through schools and mass  media

campaigns to inculcate right values and good social behaviour in

our children.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools consider the inculcation of moral values in our young an

important  role.  Primary  schools  actively  promote  courtesy,

respect, and general good behaviour through the Civics and Moral

Education  Programme, which is an integral part of  the  primary

school curriculum.  This is reinforced by talks by the Principal

during  the weekly school assembly, and guidance from  teachers.

Pupils  also  get  to learn about good behaviour  and  desirable

values through stories they read during their English and Mother

Tongue Language periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many primary schools organise activities to encourage good

behaviour.  One such activity is the selection of the most

courteous or best-behaved pupil in each level or class on a

termly basis.  Pupils also imbibe desirable values through

participation in sports and games, as well as other extra-curricular activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every school also has in place a set of school rules to guide

pupils.  Pupils who infringe school rules are counselled.   When

necessary,  parents are also brought in to work with the  school

to help these pupils improve their behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To successfully educate a child, parents play a crucial role.

Whatever  is taught in school has to be reinforced at home.   In

fact,  good  attitude and behaviour begin at home.  There  is  a

limit to what schools can do.  Most schools do organise meetings

with  parents every semester.  These are carried out  mostly  by

levels.  During these meetings, school expectations with  regard

to  pupil behaviour are communicated.  Sometimes, guest speakers

are invited to speak on parenting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because parents are the most immediate and closest adult

figures,  they  exert a powerful impact on the  lives  of  their

children.   Teachers  may vary from year to  year,  but  parents

remain  the  constant  adult  figures  in  the  lives  of  their

children.   And they must

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>

continue  to  be so.  No one else can substitute  for  the  role

played  by  parents because of the closeness between parent  and

child.    It   is  therefore  vital  that  parents  spend   time

communicating with their children, supervising and guiding them.

<div align="center"><b>WATER SURVIVAL, LIFE-SAVING AND FIRST-AID LESSONS FOR SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  the Ministry will consider introducing water  survival,

life-saving and first aid lessons as extra-curricular activities

for   all   schools,  and  accord  more  recognition   for   the

participation of such activities.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming as a water survival skill is promoted in the school ECA

programmes.  It is also one of the core ECA sports activity, but

it  is  not  compulsory: there are only 6 schools with  swimming

pools,  while the schools situated near the 27 public pools  are

encouraged  to  conduct  swimming  lessons  for  their   pupils.

Presently,  145  primary schools (74%) and 70 secondary  schools

(45%) have swimming in their ECA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has no plans to make life-saving and first aid an

ECA in schools.  Simple rescue techniques,  but not life-saving,

are  taught as part of the swimming programme and in other water

sports, like sailing and canoeing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic first aid, eg, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation is included

in  the PE programme of secondary schools.  First aid is already

among the training activities of all uniformed groups.  There is

no need to promote it as an ECA on its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other ECA, pupils who offer swimming as a sport would be

awarded ECA points based on their level of participation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air safety is a top priority for the Civil Aviation Authority of

far only set aside dedicated lanes to scheduled public buses  in

order  to  give them priority because buses are a more efficient

form  of  people mover than cars. Even then, bus lanes are  only

operational during the peak hours and not during other times  so

that the road space is optimally utilised. We cannot provide for

dedicated cycling lanes along public roads because they take  up

precious road space.

roads  safely, HDB does not specifically provide bicycle  tracks

within housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the older housing estates, the layout of the service roads

halfway houses (HWH).



<br><br><i>Socio-economic characteristics</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55% of the inmates in our Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRCs) and

HWHs  are  Malay.   More than 60% of the inmates are between  25

and  39  years  old.  51%  and  40% have  attained  primary  and

secondary education respectively.



<br><br><i>Recidivism</i>

81%  in  1994, 1997 was the third consecutive year  the  relapse

rate had fallen.



<br><br><i>Aftercare rehabilitation needs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Prisons Department survey showed that employment was the top

concern  of  32%  of  the  inmates, followed  by  the  need  for

continued    counselling   (21%)   and    vocational    training

opportunities  (21%).  Our  current  rehabilitation   programmes

already focus on offering employment opportunities and aftercare

support for recovering drug addicts.    Workshops in DRCs  offer

work opportunities for the inmates and enable them to learn  on-the-job  skills. SCORE also offers a variety of  vocational  and

different from now. There was strong interest in the site.  More

than  70  developers' packets were sold and  there  were  active

queries  by  developers  on the details  of  the  site.  Several

architectural  firms  were asked by clients  to  look  into  the

design of the development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the regional economic landscape and our market

conditions had changed considerably since then, there was  still

active  interest  in  the sale site. Given that  the  interested

developers  had  invested much time and money  in  studying  the

site,  it would be unfair to them if the Government had  aborted

the  tender.  It would call to question the credibility  of  the

Government's tender system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the prominent location of the site and the fact that part

of  the  parcel  is affected by the MRT line, the  size  of  the

parcel  is  appropriate. However, in view of the current  market

conditions, URA will not re-tender the site this year. URA  will

review  whether other smaller parcels at the New Downtown should

be released instead, and when to do so.

larger flat to accommodate the extended family living together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Housing Grant Scheme implemented in 1994 provides a

housing grant for first-timer couples who are buying resale  HDB

flats.  If the first-timer couple buys a resale HDB flat in  the

same  estate or within 2 km from their parents' flat,  they  are

eligible  for a higher grant of $50,000. Similarly, a multi-tier

family  buying  a resale flat to stay together is also  eligible

for the $50,000 CPF housing grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)Lessees/Tenants Affected By SERS/Relocation Scheme



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support an extended family living together, affected lessees

or  tenants  under  the  Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment  Scheme

(SERS)  or  Relocation  Scheme  are  allowed  to  include  their

children as joint applicants in their application for new flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Mutual Exchange of Flats Scheme



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mutual Exchange of Flats Scheme introduced in 1979 provides

another  avenue for married children and their parents  to  stay

near  each other.   This scheme allows lessees of HDB flats  who

have  occupied their flats for at least a year to exchange their

flats in the same or different estates. Through this scheme, the

married child can exchange his existing flat with another lessee

whose  flat is close to that belonging to the former's  parents,

so that the married child could live close to his parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Studio Apartments



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1998, the first batch of Studio Apartments for elderly

was  launched  in  the older estates as an alternative  form  of

housing for senior citizens.  HDB is mindful of maintaining  the

family  ties between the elderly lessees who wish to live  apart

from  their  children  but yet be near to them.  Thus,  priority

allocation  of  Studio Apartments is given  to  elderly  lessees

whose  children  are taking over the elderly  lessee's  existing

flats  that  are located in the same electoral division  as  the

Studio  Apartments. With this, the elderly lessees are  able  to

continue  living  in  the same housing  estate  which  they  are

familiar  with, and at the same time be in close proximity  with

their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will keep an open mind to new proposals that aim to encour

age  young  couples  to buy a flat to stay with  or  near  their

parents.

<div align="center"><b>LONGER PERIOD TO COMPLETE SALE OF HDB FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether  he  will  consider  allowing  Housing  and

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lessee who has collected the keys to his new HDB flat is given

6  months  to  sell  his existing HDB flat in the  open  market.

Generally,  this is a sufficient period for the lessee  to  sell

his existing flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the lessee is unable to sell his existing flat

within  the  6  months  due  to justifiable  reasons,  HDB  will

consider extending the six-month period on a case-by-case basis.

<div align="center"><b>PLAN TO FOSTER STRONG CHINESE CULTURAL ELITE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Information

and  the  Arts (a) whether the Government has set up any  target

and  concrete plan of action to foster a strong Chinese cultural

elite; and (b) in what way can the Government encourage and work

with  the ethnic Chinese community to achieve the target without

causing  any  undesirable ethnic sensitivity in our multi-racial

and multi-cultural society.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's plan to encourage the use of Chinese and help

foster  a Chinese cultural elite was outlined by PM in his  1997

National  Day  Rally speech and DPM Lee in his  speech  at  last

year's  launch of the Speak Mandarin Campaign. The  Ministry  of

Education is also currently undertaking a review to improve upon

the  effectiveness of teaching of Chinese Language  in  schools.

Some steps being considered include the strengthening of our SAP

schools,  offering  more  Chinese  scholarships,  and  improving

teaching materials and techniques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA will continue its efforts to make Chinese culture relevant

and interesting to a younger generation of Chinese Singaporeans.

We  do  this through the promotion of Chinese culture,  heritage

and  Mandarin.  MITA and its statutory boards work closely  with

Chinese civic organisations in many activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speak Mandarin Campaign is now in its 20th year and has

achieved  some  success.   The National Arts  Council  regularly

supports  Chinese  performing and literary  arts.  The  National

Heritage   Board's  Asian  Civilisations  Museum  explores   and

presents  the heritage of Singaporeans in the context  of  their

ancestral  cultures. The National Library Board has  signed  co-operation agreements with the National Library of China and  the

Shanghai  Library, which will allow Singaporeans to  access  the

catalogues  of  these two libraries. The NLB has  also  embarked

upon  an  expansion programme to expand and improve its  Chinese

collection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts help to ensure that we have a sizeable group of

Singaporeans with a good command of Chinese and a deep knowledge

of Chinese culture. But it must be emphasised that many of these

measures  are long term in nature and the results  can  only  be

seen  after  many years.  For example, our promotion of  Chinese

Internet will only bear fruit in the next century.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-cultural society. Mr Tay

Beng Chuan is absolutely right that we must be sensitive in  the

way  we  promote our ethnic cultures.  The key  to  this  is  in

forging a common Singapore culture and consciousness which  bind

Singaporeans of all ethnic and religious groups together.   With

each generation and with each crisis, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>

should pull closer together.  Much of MITA's effort concentrates

on building up this sense of one Singapore.  The coming National

Education Exhibition in July will emphasize the awakening of our

national  consciousness  and our common  struggle  to  create  a

separate and independent Singapore identity.

tender bid and, if so, whether its members will be debarred from

future  government tenders for a fixed period and whether  there

will be a re-tender exercise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   if   he  will  give  an  elaboration   on   the

circumstances  relating to, and an update of the  inquiry  into,

the  withdrawal  of  the  mobile phone licence  awarded  to  P2P

Communications Pte Ltd on the ground that it is not able to form

the  consortium along the shareholding structure proposed in the

tender  submission and whether steps have been or will be  taken

to strengthen the tender procedures in this regard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS called for a tender in October 1997 to award up to 2 more

mobile  phone operators. At the close of tender on 31st December

1997,  2  consortia submitted bids - the StarHub consortium  and

P2P  consortium. The Tender Evaluation Committee evaluated  both

bids  and recommended that both consortia be awarded the  mobile

phone licences. Tender results were announced on 23rd April. The

next  day, 24th April, GTE, one of the consortium members  named

in  the P2P tender document,  issued a statement that it was not

a  member of the P2P consortium and had no equity stake  in  the

venture.  This  was contrary to what was claimed in  the  tender

document.    The   incident   has   created   much   unnecessary

inconvenience to TAS and the other parties involved. TAS is  now

investigating whether there was any misrepresentation  in  P2P's

tender submission. I expect the investigation to be completed in

the   next   few  weeks.  Depending  on  the  outcome   of   the

investigation,  appropriate action will  be  taken  against  the

parties concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two parts to the tender. One is the tender submission

process.  Like  other  government tenders, TAS'  current  tender

submission  process does not categorically stipulate  that  each

and every partner in a consortium must sign the tender document.

This  has not given rise to any problem with TAS' other  tenders

until now. However in view of this incident, I have asked TAS to

review  the  tender  submission  requirements  to  see  if   any

improvements  can be made to ensure that such incidents  do  not

happen again in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of the tender process is the tender evaluation.

To  make the process as transparent as possible,TAS made  public

the  key  evaluation criteria of the tender  as  well  as  their

weightages. The tender proposals were evaluated based  on  these

criteria by a Tender Evaluation Committee which included members

from the public and the private sectors. I am satisfied that all

necessary measures were taken to preserve the integrity  of  the

tender evaluation process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of re-tender, TAS will not be calling another

tender  soon. However, depending on how the market develops  and

if  there is a need, it is possible that future tenders could be

called  before the year 2000. Nevertheless, I should  point  out

that  with one more mobile licence awarded this time, there will

be three competing operators come year 2000.

<div align="center"><b>PSA CORPORATION LTD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications, in respect of PSA Corporation Ltd, (a) what  are

its return on assets, return on equity and net profit margin for

1997  given its pre-tax profit of $1,124 million and  how  these

figures compare with the targets set for its flotation; (b)  how

it  prices  its services; (c) how the drive to list  it  on  the

Stock Exchange of Singapore impacts on its service pricing;  and

(d)  whether the Corporation will consider passing on  the  huge

pre-tax  profit to the industry by lowering various port tariffs

and charges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The financial figures requested are as follows:

<pre>

          Return on Total Asset    :    11.8%

          Return on Equity         :    14.6%

          Return on Sales          :    39.0%

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return on Sales figure excludes non-operating income accumulated

when PSA was a statutory board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures are for PSA, the statutory board, from January to

September 1997 and PSA Corporation, the company, from October to

December 1997.   If we applied the corporate tax of 26% for  the

first 9 months when PSA was a statutory board, the figures would

be  lower at 11.1%, 13.8% and 37%, respectively.  These  figures

would be lower for PSA Corporation in future years because  upon

corporatisation on 1st October 1997, PSA's assets were  revalued

to  market  prices,  and as a company, PSA Corporation  will  be

subjected to a higher corporate tax regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA was corporatised less than 1 year ago - in October 1997.

The date for PSA's privatisation has not been fixed.  Similarly,

details  such as financial targets or extent of share  placement

have not been decided yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b and c) The bulk of PSA's container business is in

transhipment  cargo.  In this area of business, PSA  faces  keen

competition  from  other  ports in the region.   Therefore,  the

Government does not regulate the charges for transhipment cargo.

PSA as a corporatised entity is fully aware that its prices must

be competitive and relevant to the needs and requirements of its

customers, otherwise they will have no hesitation to  use  other

regional ports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for local cargo, the Government does regulate the

tariffs  through the Maritime and Port Authority.   This  is  to

ensure  they  remain competitive and safeguard the  interest  of

local exporters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA's pricing strategy is not influenced by plans for its

listing on the Stock Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The port industry is a highly competitive international

business.   It  is  also  very capital intensive.  For  example,

Phases  I  and  II of the new Pasir Panjang Terminal  will  cost

about  $7000 million.  Setting the correct level of  tariffs  is

critical to its viability. It must provide customers with value-for-money. It must also allow PSA to make a reasonable return on

its investment so that it can reward its shareholders, its staff

and re-invest in the business. Therefore, PSA has always set the

prices for its services very competitively.  Over the years, PSA

has  focused on reducing cost and improving the productivity  of

its  operations.   The productivity gains are  shared  with  its

customers  in  the form of discounts, rebates and  lower  tariff

rates.   PSA  will continue to look into ways to  further  lower

costs  or increase cost effectiveness of its services, and  pass

on these savings to its customers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Nominated Member of Parliament for her interest in

the  outreach  programme.  Last year, the Ministry of  Community

Development  (MCD) embarked on a joint project with  the  Marine

Parade  CDC  and  the  Tanjong Pagar CDC to pilot  the  outreach

programme  in  10 blocks of 1 and 2-room HDB flats  in  the  two

CDCs.   A  total of 167 volunteers from the CDCs, RCs  and  VWOs

were  enlisted to go door-to-door to 1,877 households to explain

to the residents the various programmes and services listed in a

booklet  entitled  "We're Just a Call Away"  published  by  MCD.

These   programmes  and  services  include  financial   matters,

family/personal     matters,     child     care,      education,

employment/skills  training,  legal  matters,  elder  care   and

services  for persons with disabilities.  Copies of the booklet,

in 4 languages, were also given to the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the outreach programme is to brief the residents

living  in these flats about the schemes and services which  the

Government  has put in place to help families in  need  and  how

they  can obtain help when needed.  It is not intended to assess

the   needs  of  the  households.   Notwithstanding  this,   the

volunteers  are  advised to refer families  requiring  immediate

help  to MCD for follow-up.  32 families have thus been referred

to MCD.  The help given to these families ranges from assistance

in   job  placement,  financial  assistance,  payment  of  rent,

utilities and conservancy charges, settlement of hospital bills,

supplementary assistance for school-going children to befriender

service for the elderly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is pleased with the programme, and plans to work with the

CDCs to extend the programme to the other 1 and 2-room HDB flats

over time.

favourably with Germany or Japan which has a ratio of  1.4%  and

UK which has a ratio of 1.9%.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Civil Service staff strength in 1997 was 65,575.

If  statutory  board  employees were also  included,  the  total

public  sector staff strength would be 114,466. As a  percentage

of the national labour force, these figures work out to 3.5% and

6.1% respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to meaningfully compare these figures with those of

other  countries.  Operating environments for  countries  differ

with  size of population, level of development and the needs  of

the  populace.  The  structure of government  also  affects  the

computation of such figures. For instance, the UK civil  service

constituted 475,200 or 1.7% of the national labour force in 1997

but  if local authorities are included, the figure would be 8.7%

of the national labour force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the size of the civil service, Government's goal

has  always been to keep it lean and trim so as to release  more

manpower  to the private sector which is the engine of  economic

growth.  While this is so, it is also important that  the  civil

service  should be efficient and effective at the same time.  In

this regard, Members of Parliament would be pleased to know that

he  will  inform  the  House whether the CPF  Board  will  allow

Malaysians  to  withdraw  their CPF savings  before  the  normal

withdrawal  age  and,  if so, what are the conditions  for  such

early withdrawals.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current CPF withdrawal rules, a West Malaysian is allowed

to  withdraw his CPF savings in full if he is at least 55  years

old and has left Singapore permanently to stay in West Malaysia.

He can also withdraw his CPF from age 50 if he has not worked in

Singapore for the 2 years before his withdrawal application.  On

the other hand, East Malaysians and other foreigners are allowed

to  withdraw  their  CPF at any age when  they  leave  Singapore

permanently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Malaysians are treated differently from East Malaysians and

other   foreigners  because  of  the  historical  links  between

Peninsular  Malaysia  and  Singapore.   They  are  also  treated

differently from Singaporeans.  They can withdraw their CPF from

age   50   without  setting  aside  the  Minimum   Sum,   unlike

Singaporeans  who can only withdraw their CPF at age  55,  after

setting aside the prevailing Minimum Sum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All foreigners working in Singapore are aware of the rules of

the  CPF system.  Contributions by foreigners to CPF in the past

were  made in accordance with the prevailing contribution rules.

They enjoyed the privilege of tax-exemptions on CPF savings  but

are  also bound by the withdrawal rules.  Subsequent changes  to

CPF rules to exempt foreigners from CPF contributions cannot  be

applied  retrospectively.  These changes did not take away  past

tax  benefits enjoyed by the foreigners, including Malaysian CPF

members.   Hence,  foreigners  and West  Malaysian  CPF  members

should  be bound by the prevailing withdrawal rules, which  they

had  accepted when they came to work in Singapore in  the  first

instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, recently, the Prime Ministers of Singapore and Malaysia

had  met  to  discuss wider co-operation between both countries,

including  financial  co-operation and the long-term  supply  of

water  to  Singapore.  Changes of CPF withdrawal conditions  for

West  Malaysians in the context of this wider co-operation  have

also  been  discussed.   The two Prime Ministers  have  not  yet

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether,

in  light  of  the current economic slowdown, measures  will  be

taken  to extend the payment of income, property and other taxes

over  a longer time frame in order to help the Small and Medium-sized    Enterprises   (SMEs),   which   are   facing   economic

difficulties, tide over this period.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax and property tax are payable by reference to a tax

year.   Income tax is calculated based on the income  earned  in

the  preceding year while property tax is based on the  rentable

value of the property for the same year.  Payment of income  tax

is  due  one  month after the issue of the notice of  assessment

while property tax is payable in advance in January and July  of

each year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help taxpayers, the Government has administratively allowed

property  tax and income tax to be paid in instalments over  the

tax  year  instead  of  the due dates.   Basically,  any  person

willing to commence instalment payment from the beginning  of  a

tax  year  is allowed to pay the year's tax in equal instalments

over  the whole year.  By allowing instalment payments over  the

year  for  which  the tax is payable and not  beyond,  it  helps

taxpayers to plan their finances and prevents them from  getting

into  huge  tax arrears.  Taxpayers who have temporary  cashflow

problems can, nevertheless, apply to IRAS for payment of the tax

beyond  the  12-months instalment period, with appropriate  late

payment penalty for the extended period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the experience of IRAS, there is as yet no serious problem

of  taxpayers being unable to meet tax payments which  fall  due

with the current instalment facilities.  IRAS is monitoring  the

situation  and  Government  will introduce  relief  measures  if

necessary.   In the meantime, taxpayers should make optimum  use

of the instalment payment arrangements offered by IRAS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Household income distribution in Singapore has remained quite

stable.   Economists  use the gini coefficient  to  measure  the

extent  to  which the distribution of household income  deviates

from  a  situation of perfectly equal income distribution.  This

coefficient takes values from zero to one; the more unequal  the

income  distribution,  the  larger the  gini  coefficient.   For

Singapore,  the gini coefficient was 0.443 in 1995,  similar  to

0.436 in 1990.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an international perspective, our measure of wealth

disparity remained favourable (see Chart below). We fared better

compared  with Hong Kong and the United States which had  showed

noticeable increase in household income inequality in the 1990s.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry  if  he will indicate whether Singapore's  economy

will  slip  into  a  recession this  year,  despite  the  strong

fundamentals of its economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy is affected by the developments in the

region  given our close linkages.  The impact on the sectors  is

not  uniform.   Sectors  which depend on the  region  are  badly

affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the economy is well diversified, overall growth is

supported by healthy performance in the US and EU economies.  We

do not expect the Singapore economy to slip into negative growth

this year.

<div align="center"><b>NUMBER OF SUICIDES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what  is  the number of suicides or attempted  suicides

recorded  by the Police during the period August 1997 and  April

1998  and  to  what extent these suicides were  related  to  the

recent  economic  crisis  by  specifying  some  of  the  salient

characteristics of the victims and causes of their deaths.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 253 suicides and 436 attempted suicides recorded by

the Police from August 1997 to April 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to ascertain whether the persons who committed

suicide  did so because of the regional economic crisis.  Police

investigations  have  shown  that 4  suicides  and  1  attempted

suicide were probably caused by heavy losses in property,  share

or business investments.

<div align="center"><b>RETRENCHMENT OF WOMEN WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower, in the recent economic crisis, how many women  workers

were  retrenched;  what kind of industries these  women  workers

were  retrenched from; and how soon afterwards did the  Ministry

succeed in finding job placements for them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 7,131 workers were retrenched in the first quarter of

this  year.   This is much higher than 4,278 retrenched  in  the

last  quarter of 1997.  Among the local workers retrenched,  57%

were  women.   68%  of retrenched women workers  came  from  the

manufacturing  sector  while  another  32%  came  from  services

sector.    61%  of the retrenched women workers were  production

and  related workers, 23% were clerical and sales employees  and

the remaining 16% were professional and technical personnel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower's Employment Service Department (ESD)

assists unemployed Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents to

find  jobs.  However,  not  all retrenched  workers  seek  ESD's

assistance  despite  our  efforts to  be  present  at  companies

carrying  out major retrenchment exercises.  In fact,  over  the

past  4  months,  only  an average of 870 job  seekers  a  month

registered  for  assistance at ESD. Out  of  these  registrants,

about  20%  were  retrenched workers.  In  most  instances,  the

Department  was able to refer them to prospective employers  for

job interviews.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However ESD had only been able to achieve 10% success rate in

placing  the job registrants.  The low success rate is  often  a

result  of the mismatch between expectation of jobs seekers  and

requirements of prospective employers.  Generally, workers  with

realistic expectations and who were prepared to make adjustments

in  respect  of  work patterns and changes to salary  were  more

likely to secure re-employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic slowdown, retrenched workers are taking longer

to  be  re-employed.  Based on CPF Board's records, 63%  of  the

local  workers retrenched in the last quarter of 1997  were  re-employed as at March 1998.  This is notably lower than  the  re-employment rate of 72% for the previous two quarters.  Among the

local  workers  retrenched  in the last  quarter  of  1997,  the

females have a slightly lower re-employment rate at 62% compared

with males at 64%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job vacancy rate which measures vacant posts as a percentage

of total establishment strength has also fallen to 2.7% in March

1998  from  5.0%  a year ago.   As a result, retrenched  workers

will have fewer choice in alternative jobs.

<div align="center"><b>SKILLS DEVELOPMENT FUND</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  whether he will consider independent applications  for

financial  support from the Skills Development Fund to encourage

individuals  recently  retrenched from corporations  to  go  for

retraining  within a stipulated time frame and for those  skills

identified by his Ministry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two programmes are currently available to assist retrenched

workers  -  the Skills Redevelopment Programme and the  Back  to

Work  Programme.   Both are supported by the Skills  Development

Fund.

<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launched as a pilot programme in 1996 by the National Trades

Union  Congress (NTUC), the SRP aims to help workers  to  remain

employable  through a systematic upgrading and certification  of

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenched workers can participate in the SRP to acquire new

skills  and find alternative jobs.  The SDF supports the  course

fees  for  pre-retrenchment training by the current employer  or

through employers who are taking in the retrenched workers.   In

the  absence of  employers able to take the retrenched  workers,

funding  is  provided  through the NTUC and community  self-help

groups to defray the cost of retraining for new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot-phase of the SRP has produced good results. Hence

Government  has committed $50 million to the next phase  of  the

programme  to  defray the cost of absentee payroll and  training

for up to 20,000 workers.  The SDF has also commited another $50

million to support the SRP.

<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Back to Work Programme (BTWP)</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Back to Work Programme was started in 1996 to attract and

assist housewives, retirees and retrenched workers to return  to

the  workforce.  Under the programme, the Ministry  of  Manpower

provides   job  placement  services  to  individuals.   Training

programmes  for re-entry into the workforce are offered  by  the

Productivity and Standards Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDF supports 100% of the course fees for the core skills

training to prepare these individuals for re-employment, and 80%

of  subsequent job skills training.  Trainees are also  given  a

$100 allowance during the period of the core skills training.

<div align="center"><b>VACANT LAND AT SERANGOON AVENUE 1</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether the Housing and Development Board  has  any

plans  for the plot of vacant land bounded by Blocks 401 to  403

at Serangoon Avenue 1 and, if not, whether the Town Council will

be  allowed  to convert it into a small precinct  park  for  the

residents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacant land bounded by Blocks 401 to 403 at Serangoon Avenue

1  is  a site reserved for a multi-storey carpark.  As currently

there are sufficient parking lots for the residents in the area,

HDB  has no plan to build the multi-storey carpark yet.  HDB has

no  objection  to the site being used temporarily  by  the  Town

Council as a precinct park for the residents for the time being.

A Temporary Occupation Licence could be issued to the grassroots

organisation,  such  as the Constituency Citizens'  Consultative

Committee, for the purpose.

<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL PARKING</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for National

Development if the Housing and Development Board will take  more

effective  action  against  the  illegal  parking  of   foreign-registered motorcycles in HDB housing estates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has been taking enforcement action against foreigners who

park  their  vehicles (including motorcycles) illegally  in  HDB

carparks.  Since  November 1994, HDB has been clamping  foreign-registered vehicles with outstanding parking offences and  found

contravening  parking  rules. This  measure  has  proven  to  be

effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another effective measure is the checking of foreign-registered

vehicles  at  Tuas and Woodlands Checkpoints. Those  found  with

outstanding parking offence notices would be stopped and advised

to settle their parking fines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has also stepped up enforcement in areas prone to illegal

parking   of  foreign-registered  motorcycles  in  HDB   housing

estates.

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL'S NATIONAL HELPLINE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community   Development  whether  he  will  give  the  following

information:  (i)  the number and profile of callers  using  the

Community Development Council's National Helpline; (ii) the type

of  problems  presented; and (iii) the kind of help extended  to

these callers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDC National Helpline was launched on 3rd January 1998 to

provide  a one-stop information, assistance and referral service

to  the public.  With the National Helpline, the public will  be

immediately  connected with the right people at the right  place

instead  of  having  to remember different helpline  numbers  in

Singapore and calling various organisations for assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19 organisations are already linked with the CDC National

Helpline  to provide a good social service network and frontline

service to those who call.  The helpline partners include  those

dealing with children, youth, family, women, community, elderly,

health and disabled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on 30th April 1998, the Helpline received 3,699 calls (see

details  below). Among them, 20.5% requested for job placements,

18.5%   for  assistance  on  family-related  matters   such   as

counselling  for  child/youth issues  and  home  placements  for

elderly/disabled person, 9.6% for financial assistance for daily

expenses,  rentals, utilities and conservancy  charges,  medical

bills  and  children's education fees, 8.3% for  legal  aid  and

counselling and 4.8% for health-related matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not track the particulars of the callers because of our

assurance of confidentiality.  Hence, we are unable to give  her

the profile of the callers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who were eligible for the social assistance schemes co-administered by the CDCs were given prompt approvals. These

schemes   include  Public  Assistance,  Rental   and   Utilities

Assistance Scheme, Small Family Improvement Scheme and Medifund.

Besides  these, interim financial help was also  provided.   Job

seekers  were matched to job banks in the Ministry of Manpower's

Labournet  and  vacancies from local  sources.   Legal  aid  and

counselling  were  given  by  professionals  from  various   CDC

partners.  Referrals to homes/institutions were also made.
