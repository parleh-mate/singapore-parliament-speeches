many  Malayan  Officers appointed by the  Secretary  of

State  have applied to retire under section 18  of  the

Retirement   from  the  Public  Service  (Compensation)

Ordinance, 1956; whether he will state their names; and

retire after receiving approval of an application under

section 18 of the Ordinance. His case was debated at

the last sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five other officers have applied to the Secretary of

State  under the same section. Of these, only  one,  an

officer   domiciled  outside  Malaya,   satisfied   the

Secretary  of  State under this section.  He  is  still

serving. I am not prepared to disclose the names of the

officers concerned.

to administer, the stadium.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, there is land at the Kallang

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing what is the policy of the

Government  in  regard  to  the  letting  out  of   the

Singapore Badminton Hall to applicants for professional

purposes.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   policy  of  Government  is  that  the   Singapore

Badminton   Hall   should   be   used   primarily   and

substantially for the purpose of furthering the game of

badminton.  It  is  considered  that  the  staging   of

professional  boxing, wrestling and other matches  will

be alien to this purpose and permission has accordingly

not  been given to the general letting of the Hall  for

professional sport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application for any specific purpose, however, can

be considered.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL SECRETARY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(INCORPORATION) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.05a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Chief Secretary holds property, both

movable and immovable, on behalf of the Government  by

virtue of the Chief Secretary Incorporation Ordinance,

which  is  Chapter 54 of the laws. The office  of  the

Chief  Secretary will cease to exist  in  its  present

form on the coming into force of the new Constitution,

and  it  will  therefore be necessary  to  make  other

provision. It is considered that, following the change

made by the Federation, it will be more appropriate to

have  the  necessary corporate body in  the  Treasury.

This Bill therefore seeks to incorporate the Financial



Secretary and to provide for the vesting in him  as  a

corporate body of the properties now held by the Chief

Secretary  Incorporated. This will mean  that  on  the

introduction  of  the new Constitution  the  corporate

body  will be the Minister charged with responsibility

for finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill itself follows, in the main, the provisions

of  the Chief Secretary Incorporation Ordinance. There

is,  I  think, only one new provision to which I  need

draw  attention, and that is in clause 5 (3) where  it

is proposed that there shall be power to vest property

in  a  public officer or authority, that  is  in  some

person other than the Financial Secretary, should  the

need  arise.  It may occasionally be more  appropriate

that  some other person, perhaps the Commissioner  for

Lands,  should  hold  certain  types  of  property.  A

similar provision appears in the Federation where they

have   it,   mainly   I  believe,   for   the   better

administration of the railway. It is not inconceivable

that  some such power might be needed in Singapore  at

some future date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN JUDGMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(RECIPROCAL ENFORCEMENT)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.13 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to the further

stages of this Bill being proceeded with, and I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the only statutory provision for the

enforcement in Singapore of judgments obtained outside

Singapore  is contained in the Reciprocal  Enforcement

of Judgments Ordinance which applies only to judgments

obtained in the United Kingdom and those parts of  the

British Commonwealth to which its provisions have been

extended. It provides that the person who has obtained

a   judgment   in   such  territory  may   apply   for

registration  of  the  judgment  to  the  High  Court,

whereupon  the  Court may, if in all the circumstances

of  the  case it thinks that it is just and convenient

so  to  do, order that the judgment be registered  and

thereby  become enforceable as if it were the judgment

of the Singapore High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill now before the Assembly goes further in that

it   applies  not  merely  to  countries  within   the

Commonwealth but to foreign countries where reciprocal

provision  has  been  made  for  the  enforcement   of

Singapore  judgments.  It  follows  very  closely  the

provisions of the United Kingdom Act of 1933 and  lays

down  detailed provisions relating to the registration

of foreign judgments, with provision for its extension

where substantial reciprocity is assured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important difference in the procedure will be

that  where  the provisions apply judgments  shall  be

registered   by   the  Court  if  certain   prescribed

conditions are satisfied. The Singapore Court must  in

certain   cases  register  judgments  and   thereafter

enforce them as though they were its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not, of course, possible at this stage to say to

what foreign countries this Bill when enacted will  be

applied, but it is a most useful first step in  giving

Singapore citizens the right to enforce here  judgment

that  they  have obtained elsewhere, and in a  trading

community such as this, I consider this Bill to  be  a

most useful and progressive step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. [Mr Shanks].

<div align="center"><b>LAWS OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>10.20 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have His Excellency's consent and

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with, and I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, seeks to make certain necessary

amendments  in various Ordinances - 17 in all.  Some  of

these  are  consequential  on  the  enactment  of  the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order in Council,  1958.  Of

the  constitutional amendments there  are  three,  and

they are contained in clauses 3, 8 and 10. Clause 3 is

self-explanatory.  It  is  designed  to   repeal   the

Governors Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 makes members of the Public Service

Commission   "public  servants"  within  the   meaning

ascribed to that expression in the Penal Code. At  the

present  time, the Public Service Commission Ordinance

does this, but that Ordinance will be repealed in  due

course  by the Constitutional Order in Council  which,

by  Part IX, will replace the existing Ordinance;  but

it  is  not correct to put in an instrument  like  the

Constitutional Order in Council the protection that is

proposed to be given by clause 8 of this present Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 is designed to amend the Criminal Procedure

Code  to give effect to paragraph 32 of the Report  of

the  Constitutional Conference held in London in  1957

and  published as Sessional Paper No. Misc. 2 of 1957.

It was there agreed that while the decision to request



the assistance of the British forces, or forces of Her

Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, in aid  of

the   civil   power  would  rest  with  the  Singapore

Government, Her Majesty's Government would retain  the

ultimate  discretion as to whether, how  and  to  what

extent  such a request should be acceded  to;  and  to

give  effect  to that, it is desirable  to  amend  the

Criminal  Procedure  Code by the insertion  of  a  new

section as is proposed by clause 10 of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opportunity has been taken to make some

other corrections and amendments to our law. Clause  2

is  a  comparatively  minor matter.  It  corrects  the

Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Ordinance

to take account of the new status of the Federation of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5, 6, 13 and 17 delete provisions of the law

which are now spent, and clauses 4, 11, 12, 14 and  16

rectify  inadvertent  omissions from  the  Legislative

Assembly   (Presentation  of  Subsidiary  Legislation)

Ordinance, 1958, which hon. Members will recall was  a

Bill with a very long Schedule amending, I think, over 70 Ordinances to bring their provisions into line with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>



the  existing  Standing Orders and  practice  of  this

House  in  relation to the presentation of  subsidiary

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of this Bill merely corrects something that

was  inadvertently overlooked in 1955  when  the  laws

were  revised,  and clause 9 amends the  Children  and

Young Persons Ordinance to remove the conflict between

an  existing  provision  in  that  Ordinance  and  the

Criminal Procedure Code regarding the age below  which

a person may not be sentenced to death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 makes an amendment to the Road Traffic

Ordinance rendered necessary by the present system  of

staggering  the  periods  for  the  issue  of  vehicle

licences  by the City Council. At present, the  period

of  grace  is one month, which worked quite well  when

licences  were  issued  twice a  year,  but  now  that

licences  are  issued  twelve  times  a  year,  it  is

desirable  to shorten this period so as to  avoid  any

overlap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 makes a drafting amendment to the recently

enacted  Police Force Ordinance, 1958, which,  on  the

coming  into force of the new Constitutional Order  in

Council,  ought  to be worded slightly differently  to

make the position abundantly clear with regard to  the

powers  of  the  Public  Service Commission  vis-a-vis

recommendations from the Commissioner  of  Police.  At

the  same  time,  it  is proposed to  amend  in  three

Ordinances  references to the Police Force  Ordinance,

1941,  which  will become inaccurate when  the  Police

Force Ordinance, 1958, is brought into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will notice that the first clause of

this Bill provides for its coming into operation on  a

date  to  be  appointed. Some  of  these  changes  are

essential preparatory steps to the smooth introduction

of  the  new Constitution, and the date of the  coming

into  operation of this Bill will, no doubt, be linked

with  the  date for the coming into force of  the  new

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quesion put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions for ordinary expenditure made in the

Appropriation  Ordinance, 1956, were exceeded  by  the

amounts and under the various Heads shown in the First

Schedule   to   the   Bill,   and   they   amount   to

$10,239,684.10.   In  the  case  of  the   Development

Estimates,  the  excess  expenditure  of  about   $142

million  is shown by the amount and under the  various

Heads  shown in the Second Schedule thereto.  In  this

connection hon. Members will recall that at a previous

sitting  of the Assembly held on 17th July,  1957,  it

was  resolved  that long-term loans to  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust and other bodies should  be  charged

to  expenditure  and  not, as in the  past,  shown  as

assets  in  the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.

This  procedure  is  in  accordance  with  established

financial  practice - that  all  transactions  involving

loans  which diminish the presurplus of revenue should

be recorded "Expenditure" at the time payment is made.

These  excesses have all been covered by supplementary

votes  approved by the Legislative Assembly from  time

to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to give legal sanction to the

supplementary votes already approved by resolution  of

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<div align="center"><b>ESTATE DUTY (AMENDMENT)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill introduces two important changes in

the law which are considered desirable in the light of

experience  in  the administration of  the  Ordinance,

both  here  and in other countries. The  first  change

proposed is that gifts of property should be deemed to

be  part of the property of the deceased at his  death

for  the  purpose of liability to estate duty if  made

within  five  years  of  the death  of  the  deceased,

instead  of  the  present three years as  provided  in

section  7 of the Ordinance as it stands. This  change

is  effected by clause 4 of the Bill. Clauses 5 and  6

are  consequential amendments. It is quite  legitimate

for a person during his lifetime to make a disposition

of  his property with a view to evasion of estate duty

on  his  death. The object of these provisions of  the

Ordinance  is  to stop such a loophole.  It  has  been

found that the present era of three years is too short

to be effective in preventing evasion of duty; both in

the  United  Kingdom and Ceylon, the period  has  been

extended  to  five  years.  A  similar  amendment  has

recently been introduced in Hongkong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change, effected by clauses 7 and 9 of the

Bill,  seeks  to  remove what is considered  to  be  a

defect in the law relating to the assessment of estate

duty.  Under the existing law in sections 38 to 40  of

the  Ordinance, no transaction in any of the  property

contained in the estate of a deceased person can  take

place unless evidence is produced that the estate duty

has  been paid. But there is no direct obligation laid

upon   the   executor   or  administrator   or   other

accountable  person to submit to the  Commissioner  of

Estate  Duty an estate duty affidavit relating to  the

duty  payable; and in practice no such action is taken

until it is intended to transact with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>



property.  The result has often been delay in  payment

of  duty and in some cases even non-payment. It is now

proposed  to  make it obligatory on  the  executor  or

other accountable person, as defined in the Ordinance,

to  submit an estate duty affidavit within six  months

of  the death of the deceased, and at the same time to

give  the Commissioner power to assess the estate duty

payable in any case where he considers it desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these new provisions are based on similar

provision  contained  in the Ceylon  legislation,  and

will  bring estate duty practice more or less in  line

with income tax practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8, 10 and 11 of the Bill introduce various

consequential amendments. Clause 12 introduces two new

sections  containing  formal  provisions  relating  to

certificates  and  notices issued by the  Commissioner

under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>



I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rubber Regulation Ordinance was enacted before

the  war,  and it was necessary in the 1930's,  during

the  years  of trade depression when there  was  over-production  of  rubber and the  price  of  rubber  had

dropped  to a very low level. This Ordinance  enforces

limitation  of  rubber production in  both  large  and

small  estates by the issue of coupons  or  grants  of

credit  for  permitted production after due assessment

has been made of the holdings in each quarter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also regulates the sale of rubber lawfully

produced under the terms of this Ordinance, as well as

the   import  and  export  of  rubber,  except   under

prescribed conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the war, as hon. Members are aware, control

over  the production of rubber has not been exercised,

nor   is   there  any  international  agreement   over

production between rubber-producing countries, and  as

a  result  the provisions of this Ordinance  have  not

been  administered. The Ordinance  has  not,  however,

been  repealed previously because of the necessity  to

keep  in  force the provisions of section  11  of  the

Ordinance setting up the Malayan Rubber Fund  and  the

Advisory Committee for the administration of the Fund.

This Fund and the Advisory Committee were in existence

until 15th January, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

Bill. Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rubber Regulation enactments of the Federation of

Malaya  have been repealed with effect from  the  15th

January,  1959,  and  have been replaced  by  the  new

Malayan   Rubber   Fund  (Research  and   Development)

Ordinance, 1958, section 13 of which provides for  the

establishment of a new Malayan Rubber Fund and  for  a

Board,  instead of a former Advisory Committee,  which

will  be  responsible for the administration  of  this

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Government has been a contributor

to  the Malayan Rubber Fund since the enactment of the

Rubber Regulation Ordinance, 1959. The objects of  the

Malayan  Rubber Fund are, inter alia, to devote  funds

for the furtherance of rubber research, improvement of

the   rubber  industry,  and  support  for  propaganda

relating to rubber. These are laudable objects and the

Colony   should  continue  to  give  support  and   to

contribute  to  the  Fund.  These  contributions   are

derived from a surcharge which is levied under section

3  of  the  Rubber Estates (Surcharge  on  Assessment)

Ordinance,   and  the  proposed  enactment   of   this

Ordinance would enable the amount collected to be paid

to  the new Malayan Rubber Fund constituted under  the

Federation Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members will recall the primary purpose of

the  provisions  of  Part  III  of  the  Criminal  Law

(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance was to give effect to

an  arrangement with the Federation of Malaya for  the

regulation  and control of the Straits  of  Johore  in

order  to prevent the movement of persons and supplies

designed  to  assist the Communist terrorists  in  the

southern  part  of  that State.  With  the  gratifying

success  which  has  been achieved by  the  Federation

authorities  in  the  campaign against  the  Communist

terrorists, it became possible at the end of last year

for  the  whole of Johore State, adjacent to Singapore

Island,  to be declared a "white" area, and  with  the

agreement of the Federation of Malaya Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>



the  Johore Straits Control Scheme terminated  on  the

31st  December. It is consequently no longer necessary

to  maintain  the  provisions  of  this  part  of  the

Ordinance  which confer the legal powers to  implement

that Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, two other matters covered by this

part  of  the Ordinance. The first is the creation  of

the  Port  of  Singapore  North  and  the  application

thereto of certain provisions of the Merchant Shipping

Ordinance.  These matters are covered by  sections  11

and  12  of  the  Ordinance, and  in  so  far  as  the

provisions are permanently required, they should  more

appropriately  be  embodied in the  Merchant  Shipping

Ordinance  itself.  This  is  being  effected  by  the

Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Bill, introduced at  the

last  sitting of the Assembly and which my  colleague,

the  Minister  for  Commerce  and  Industry,  will  be

putting through its remaining stages of the day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter relates to certain restrictions

imposed  on  shipping using Telok Ayer Basin  and  the

waters  around  Keppel  Harbour,  Pulau  Bukom,  Pulau

Sebarok,  and St. John's Island. These are dealt  with

in  sections  13 and 14 of the Ordinance.  Certain  of

these  provisions  have since  been  included  in  the

Singapore  Port Rules and are consequently  redundant,

whilst the security of the places listed in the  Fifth

Schedule   to  the  Ordinance  can,  I  consider,   be

adequately  protected, where necessary, by appropriate

declarations  under  the Protected  Places  and  Areas

Ordinance, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accordingly now possible to repeal the whole of

Part   III   of  this  temporary  Ordinance,   and   I

accordingly beg to move.

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is connected with the Criminal Law

(Temporary  Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1959,  which

my  colleague,  the Chief Secretary, moved  just  now.

This  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)  (Amendment)

Bill  proposes, inter alia, the repeal of sections  11

and  12  of  the  Criminal Law (Temporary  Provisions)

Ordinance so as to put into effect the termination  of

the  Johore Straits Control Scheme. These two sections

provide for the establishment of the Port of Singapore

North, and require that vessels arriving and departing

from  places  within  this port  must  submit  arrival

reports  to the Harbour Master, Singapore North,  from

whom they must also obtain port clearances. This is in

accordance  with the procedure for the  main  Port  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 427 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance dealing

with  port clearances is so worded that they  must  be

obtained before leaving any port in Singapore  Island.

But  section  423  of  the  same  Ordinance  does  not

specifically lay down the same requirements in  regard

to  reporting  arrivals. The Bill  I  now  propose  is

designed  to  ensure  that  reports  of  arrival   are

required  equally with port clearances, to enable  the

Port  Officer  to be advised of shipping movements  in

Singapore  waters.  I consider that  this  is  a  most

desirable  procedure.  At the same  time,  I  wish  to

assure  this House that this Bill will not be  applied

so  as  to  hamper  small craft of  under  five  tons,

especially  those  of our fishermen in  proceeding  on

their lawful mission. In consequence, I propose to use

my  powers under the relevant sections of the Merchant

Shipping Ordinance to ensure a general exemption of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>



vessels  under five tons so that the important section

of   our   productive  industry  constituted  by   our

fishermen  shall  not  be hindered  in  the  movements

necessary for their valuable work.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary object of this Bill, Sir, is to make the

necessary  amendments  to  the  Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance,  1957, consequent on the enactment  of  the

State of Singapore Act, 1958, which amends the British

Nationality Act, 1948, so as to confer the status of a

British  subject and Commonwealth citizen on a citizen

of  Singapore. As hon. Members are aware, this  status

was   agreed   to   at  the  Singapore  Constitutional

Conference held in London in 1957, and is embodied  in

paragraph 51 of the Report of that Conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present Singapore citizenship has only a local

status  and significance, and it will not possess  any

international  status  and  significance   until   the

British  Nationality Act, 1948, is amended  to  confer

the  status  of  a  British subject  and  Commonwealth

citizen on a Singapore citizen. This amendment,  which

is  embodied in the State of Singapore Act, only comes

into  force when the State of Singapore Act comes into

operation.   This,   in   effect,   means   that   the

international status of Singapore citizenship will  be

recognised  when  the  new Constitution  of  Singapore

comes into being. This amending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance, therefore, will not itself be brought  into

operation until the appointed day for the introduction

of the new Constitution or immediately thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the combined effect of clauses 2 (b) and 3 of

the  Bill  is  to provide that a citizen of  Singapore

shall,  by virtue of that citizenship, have the status

of  a  British  subject and Commonwealth citizen,  and

also  expressly to confer this status on a citizen  of

the  United Kingdom and Colonies and a citizen of  any

country other than the State of Singapore for the time

being  included in subsection (3) of section 1 of  the

British  Nationality Act, 1948. It is considered  more

satisfactory  that this common status of  citizens  of

other  Commonwealth  countries  should  be  explicitly

conferred   in   Singapore  law   by   the   Singapore

Citizenship Ordinance itself than by simply relying on

the  provisions of the British Nationality Act,  1948,

to make this common status operative in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 5 of the Bill, the proposed amendment of

section   8  (2)  of  the  Ordinance  is  a  necessary

corollary  to  clauses 2 and 3 of the  Bill.  As  hon.

Members are aware, under section 8 (2), on a basis  of

reciprocity,  the  Singapore Government  may  allow  a

citizen of any Commonwealth country or the Republic of

Ireland to be registered as a citizen of Singapore  on

the  same conditions as citizens of the United Kingdom

and  Colonies  are registered. Since upon  the  coming

into force of the new Constitution, Singapore citizens

will  also be Commonwealth citizens, section 8 (2)  is

being  amended  to make it clear that this  subsection

does not apply to Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opportunity has also been taken to make

certain  other  amendments to  the  parent  Ordinance.

These  are mainly of an administrative nature and  are



intended  to rectify those provisions to the Ordinance

which  have  been  proved  from  experience  to  raise

certain difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (c) introduces a definition of "reside" and

is  intended  to avoid conflicting interpretations  of

the meaning of residence in Singapore for the purposes

of this Ordinance and of the Immigration Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the Ordinance provides for the

registration   of  births  of  persons  born   outside

Singapore  to  substantiate claims to  citizenship  by

descent under section 5 of the Ordinance at the office

of  an  official  representative of Singapore  in  the

country of birth or, where there is no such office, at

the office of the Minister in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 proposes to delete this provision since

Singapore  has  no representative at present  anywhere

other than the Trade Commissioner in London, and it is

intended instead to make provision for registration of

birth by post in the rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes a small amendment to section 12 of the

Ordinance to make it clear that the Minister refers an

application  to the Advisory Committee  only  when  he

decides  to refuse the application in the exercise  of

his  discretion. Applications which,  on  their  face,

fail  to qualify under the law will not need to go  to

the Advisory Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of clause 7 is to tidy up the provisions

of  section 18 of the Ordinance which deals  with  the

treating of periods of absence as periods of residence

in   Singapore.  The  Minister  already  has  complete

discretion  which is not restricted  by  the  specific

purposes at present mentioned in the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 (a) is only a drafting amendment which makes

for uniformity in expression in respect of sections 22

(3)  and  (4) of the Ordinance, and clause 8 (b)  also

amends section 22 (4) (b) for the same reason as  that

which I have given in respect of clause 4 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 makes provision for a fine as an alternative

or  in  addition to imprisonment in the penalty  under

section  24  (1)  of the Citizenship Ordinance,  which

deals  with  the  making of false statements  for  the

purpose of procuring anything to be done or not to  be

done under the Ordinance. At present the punishment is

one of imprisonment only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are the amendments proposed in the Bill, and

to summarise, they deal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>



with matters which either are constitutionally

required or seek to clarify the provisions of the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as we

know,  this amendment is merely just a consequence  of

the enactment of the State of Singapore Act. But there

is one point which I wish the Hon. the Chief Secretary

will   clarify,  and  that  is  regarding  the  travel

documents.  We cannot deny this as a fact. At  present

the  holder  of  Singapore  citizenship  must  have  a

certificate of identity in order to travel,  and  even

if  he wishes to travel to London, he must have a visa

to  London. And if he is a British subject before  the

citizenship  is  granted,  he  travels  on  a  British

passport.  I  therefore wish the Chief  Secretary  can

clarify whether the Government is prepared to issue  a

Singapore passport for all and not a British  passport

or a Citizen of Singapore passport.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I can deal very briefly with the

point raised by the hon. Member for Changi. There  has

been  no  change  up till now in the  eligibility  for

passports  as  a  result of the Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance. As I explained in moving the Bill,  it  has

at  present only a local status and significance,  and

no  international status and significance. All persons

eligible for passports before this Ordinance came  in,

and  who have acquired the status of citizens  of  the

United  Kingdom and colonies, are still  eligible  for

British  passports. When the State  of  Singapore  Act

comes into force on the appointed day, Singapore  will

have  the  competence to issue its own  passports  and

will do so for all Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One difficulty which has so far arisen, has arisen

not   in   connection  with  the  operation  of   this

Ordinance,  and  that  is the  eligibility  of  Indian

persons  who have taken out Singapore citizenship  and

who  have  thereby lost their eligibility  for  Indian

passports. That situation will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>



remedied  when the new Constitution is introduced  and

the State of Singapore Act becomes operative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr David].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read the Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 16 of 1959)</b></div>

<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation

to move the following motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $13,500

shall be supplied to the Government under the heads of

expenditure and for the services specified in Schedule

D contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 16 of 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in its White Paper on Malayanisation Policy, the

Government  stated  that a complete reorganisation  of

the  Civil Service was in course of being planned. One

of  the  main  objects  was to  ensure  that  as  many

Malayans  as  possible should be  enabled,  either  by

promotion within the service or by recruitment to  the

service, to fill posts vacated by expatriate officers.

The  general basis for the complete reorganisation  of



the public service has been agreed as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The large number of salary scales in use for

officers in Divisions I-III should be replaced  by

4  key salary scales for men and 4 key scales  for

women   appropriate  to  candidates  of  different

academic  attainments. There should, in  addition,

be  a  small number of key salary scales to  which

officers, after their first appointment, could  be

promoted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A new simplified salary structure for Division

IV  officers,  consisting of 17 key scales,  which

had  been  agreed  with  the  Staff  Side  of  the

Singapore Civil Service Joint Council in 1957  and

implemented for the great majority of Division  IV

officers  should be applied to the  remaining  few

(except the Police) who had been omitted from  the

main revision for various reasons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of these proposals have been completed and

approved  by the Assembly. Hon. Members will recollect

that   the  reorganisation  of  the  General  Clerical

Services  was implemented in Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.

14  of  1957 and approved by the Assembly on the  25th



April,  1957.  The  revision  and  rationalisation  of

salary scales in Division IV as contained in Sessional

Paper  No.  Cmd.  43  of  1957 was  approved  on  16th

October,  1957.  The General Executive Service  Scheme

was  contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 5  of  1958

and  approved by the Assembly on the 24th April, 1958.

The  revision of the salaries of Revenue  Officers  in



the  Customs Department in Division IV was implemented

in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 23 of 1958 and approved by

the Assembly on

13th August, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to implement the revision of salary

scales  of  the  other categories in  Division  IV  in

respect of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Officers in the technical grades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Open vote employees such as



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Tan Tock Seng employees, who are 604 in number,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) School servants and others in aided schools, who are 701 in number, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Government employees, who number about 200.



<br><br>These  were left out in the original review  in  1957

referred to above pending examination of their status.

The  details  of  these  revisions  are  set  out   in



paragraphs  3  and 4 and Schedule A of  the  Sessional

Paper, and have been agreed with the Staff Side of the

Joint Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Department is mainly staffed by officers

who  can  seek  their advancement in  that  department

alone,  i.e. they are not in the Common User Services.

it is not necessary that they should have professional



qualifications  and,  for this  reason,  there  is  no

special  difficulty  in devising  Schemes  of  Service

which  allow able men to reach the higher posts.  They

bear   comparison  with  officers   in   the   General

Executive,   General  Clerical  Officer  and   General

Clerical Assistant Services in respect of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>



nature  of  the  duties.  On  this  basis,  comparable

Schemes  of Service have accordingly been agreed  with

representative staff associations, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Officers Service,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Revenue Officers (Senior) Service,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Revenue Officers (Lower) Service.



<br><br>The  salary  scales used in these three  Services  are

those used in their counterpart Common User Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, an extensive examination of the

duties of Customs Officers was undertaken, and  it  is

anticipated that by a more economical use  of  Customs

Officers a considerable saving in expenditure will  be

possible  in future. No additional funds are, however,

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a complete revision of the salaries of all

medical  personnel is contemplated, it has been  found

expedient   to   deal  first  with  Nurses,   Hospital

Assistants and related grades. An extensive survey  of

the  working conditions and terms of service of  these

grades was carried out in 1957 as a result of which it

became    apparent    that   a    very    considerable

reorganisation was necessary. For many years prior  to

that  date,  a  grade  of officer  known  as  Hospital

Assistant  had  been  employed on  a  multiplicity  of

duties  connected  with hospital  work.  Their  duties

included   nursing,   dispensing,   laboratory   work,

hospital  administration, storekeeping,  etc.  It  has

been   found  under  modern  conditions  that  it   is

impossible  for a man liable to such varied employment

to  become  proficient at any  one  duty,  and  it  is

therefore decided that the Hospital Assistants Service

should  be  broken up and its members transferred,  so

far   as   possible,   to  the  Specialised   Services

appropriate   to   the  duties  they   were   actually

performing.   Some  Hospital  Assistants  nevertheless

remain   who  cannot  be  transferred  to  Specialised

Services on account of differences in training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services to which Hospital Assistants are to be

transferred are those which deal with laboratory work,

dispensing and nursing. At the same time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>



as  the  reorganisation  of  the  Hospital  Assistants

Service   is   effected,  it  is  also  desirable   to

reorganise  the  services to  which  they  are  to  be

transferred.  One  of  these  services,  the   Nursing

Service,, is closely related to the Assistant  Nurses,

Midwives  and  other  Services.  It  has  thus  become

desirable  to revise the salaries and Schemes  of  all

these related Services in one operation. In the event,

it  has  been  possible to come to  agreement  on  new

salaries and on detailed Schemes of Service for:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nursing Sisters

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laboratory Technicians

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Health Inspectors

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispensing Assistants

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midwives

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental Technicians

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental Nurses

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Nurses

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental Assistants, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital Assistants (the residue who cannot be transferred to other Services).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the above reorganisation, in most

cases,   there   will  be  long-term  economies   when

recruitment and promotion is made on the lower  salary

scales, but from the immediate point of view there are

additional  costs. In most cases, there are equivalent

offset savings and, in all, supplementary provision of

$13,500 only is required. The details are set  out  in

Schedule D.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this development considerable progress has been

made  in  implementing the decision to reorganise  the

Civil  Service.  It has however not been  possible  to

finalise negotiations in respect of other sections  of

the  public  service which are now in progress.  Other

proposals  will  no doubt be considered  at  the  next

appropriate moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 49-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the sum of $2,500 for Head 49

stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to enquire whether

I  am correct in thinking that whereas up till now male

nurses and female nurses have been, generally speaking,

on  the same salary scale, it is now proposed that male

nurses  be  paid a higher salary than female nurses.  I

base my assumption on what is contained in Schedule  C,

page  22,  for example, where at present both male  and

female  nurses,  or assistant nurses are  on  the  same

salary  scale  of  $120  to  $190,  there  is   now   a

differentiation as between male and female nurses,  for

example, from $170 to $330 per month in respect of male

nurses, and $160 to $270 per month in respect of female

nurses. There is also a differentiation, if you turn to

page  19 - male nurses, as they will now be  called,  and

staff nurses on page 23, it appears they are now on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>



same scale, and there is to be a differentiation in

favour of the male nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we would like to know the reason which prompted

the  Government to make this differentiation. We cannot

accept the situation that female nurses, of all people,

should  be  paid less than their masculine counterpart.

When  one  talks  of  nurses, one naturally  thinks  of

female  nurses - the care, the attention and the devotion

which  women  above all can give to the  sick  and  the

suffering.  I  think  there is no  question  that  male

nurses  come second in our minds as being employed  for

only  a  limited  number  of specific  tasks.  In  this

respect, therefore, we oppose this particular  Head  as

being  thoroughly wrong and unjust to the devoted  band

of  women  who  form  the major  part  of  the  nursing

services.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the matter raised by the hon. Member

is  one  which is an issue of principle and  is  to  be

found  throughout  the  salary  scales  in  the  public

service  below a certain level, and it is not based  on

any  lower  regard for the woman officer as opposed  to

the  male  officer.  But it is based  primarily,  as  I

understand it, on the responsibilities which attach  to

the  male member of the family in maintaining a  family

as  against his female counterpart. Until such time  as

the principle itself is amended and equal pay for equal

work   is   accepted  in  the  Government  service   in

Singapore,  I  do not see that there is any  reason  to

single  out any particular service in order to make  an

exception to the principle.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to inquire

from  the Hon. the Chief Secretary whether it is not  a

fact  that  up  till now there has been equal  pay  for

equal  service  as  between male and female  nurses  as

shown in this paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> On that, Sir, it was made clear by the

Hon. the Financial Secretary in moving his motion, that

this  has been a cleaning-up exercise in order  to  put

all  scales appropriately in line with one another, and

this has been part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>



the  negotiations with the Staff side of the Singapore

Joint Council and is agreed with the Staff side.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, the Financial Secretary says this is a

cleaning-up. This is discriminating against the female

nurse -  a  new  departure for  which  we  can  see  no

justification.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I can only say that the hon. Member

is entitled to his own opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, in this item, the

explanatory  note  is quite clear  - "This  Unit  would

perform  static guard and escort duties." And  in  the

last  part of the note can be seen the words,  "It  is

proposed  at  present  not to retrench  those  Special

Constables  who would not be absorbed into  the  Guard

and Escort . . ."-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are on Head 49, Medical and

Health.  I  cannot imagine that police constables  are

male nurses!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, with regard to the explanation

given  by the Hon. the Chief Secretary in reply to  my

colleague,  the  hon. Member for Tanglin,  is  it  not

possible  that the words "Male Nurses" be  changed  to

something  else? They sound very awkward.  If  we  can

expect service from a nurse, it is a female nurse  and

not a male nurse. If any difference in salary is to be

kept,  I  think  a  wise  move  on  the  part  of  the

Government  will  be to change from "Male  Nurses"  to

something else for males.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, as far as I am aware, it is only in

the  mental  hospital that male  nurses  are  in  fact

employed.  The hon. Member is, of course, entitled  to

his  own opinion as to which sex he prefers in his own

nursing attendance. I would only say, on the point  he

raises,  that  I  think it will  be  a  pity  if  this

Assembly  should concern itself with details  of  this

kind  in matters that have been negotiated and  agreed

with the Staff side.

<br><br>11.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation

to move the following motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$2,889,360  shall be supplied to the Government  under

the   heads  of  expenditure  and  for  the   services

specified in the Schedule contained in Sessional Paper

No. Cmd. 17 of 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are reaching the dissolution of the

Assembly it would be appropriate if I were to  make  a

short statement on the financial position as disclosed

in  the provisional 1958 Accounts which have still  to

be checked by the Director of Audit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will recall that at the last Budget

sitting, it was forecast that the year would end  with

revenue and expenditure balanced at $248 million, with

a deficit of $13 million in the Development Fund and a

charge   of   about   $4   million   in   respect   of

Malayanisation Compensation, both of which would  have

to be met from reserve. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>



general  revenue balance which stood at $78 million  at

the  end of 1957 was estimated to be $83 million at the

end of 1958, after taking into account on the one hand,

the  $20 million which had been received in respect  of

Christmas  Island  transfer  and  the  appreciation  of

investments,  and on the other hand, deductions  to  be

made  to  meet the deficit in the Development Fund  and

the   Malayanisation  Compensation  payment.  The  year

however  ended on a slightly happier note. The  revised

estimate of revenue at the time of the Budget was  $248

million. It was actually about

$250  million, an increase of about $2 million, chiefly

accounted for by an unexpected receipt late in the year

of   over   $1  million,  which  represent  refund   of

contributions  to the M.E.O. after the M.E.O. accounts

had  been finalised. The total revised expenditure  was

then  $265  million  (which  included  $4  million  for

Malayanisation Compensation and a contribution  of  $13

million to cover this deficit in the Development Fund).

As  it  turned out, the actual expenditure  was  $264.8

million  (which  included $4.7 million  in  respect  of

Malayanisation  Compensation  and  $14.3   million   as

additional  contribution  to  the  Development   Fund).

Taking  into  account  the  $20  million  revenue  from

Christmas Island transfer, there is therefore a surplus

of about $5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is again an appreciation of investments to the

extent  of $3.6 million. Taking this into account,  the

general  revenue balance as at 31st December, 1958  was

$87 million, instead of the estimated $83 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Assembly is dissolved at the end of this

month, there will be a lapse of about two months before

the  general elections are held. It will again be  some

time   before   the   Government  is   ready   with   a

supplementary  budget to implement her policy.  In  the

meantime,  there are certain essential  services  which

will have to be carried out during the interregnum  and

financial  provision would have to be  sought  at  this

sitting  so  that  there would not  be  any  difficulty

experienced during the next three months. It should  be

in this light that the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>



applications  for  supplementary  provision   in   this

Sessional Paper should be looked at.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are altogether 55 applications for

supplementary provision including 18 revotes, involving

a  total expenditure of $3,060,135 with possible offset

savings  of  $170,775,  leaving a  net  expenditure  of

$2,889,360  in  respect of which the  approval  of  the

Assembly is sought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ordinary Estimates, there are 29 applications,

involving  an  amount  of $1,113,539  with  13  revotes

involving $59,117. Among the big items of supplementary

votes are the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) $393,030 has been provided in the Estimates for

the  Legislative Assembly Elections. Following the

proposal to introduce compulsory voting,  it  will

be  necessary  to  provide for  additional  staff,

polling  stations and equipment and also publicity

to   ensure   the   success  of   this   proposal.

Additional provision of $160,500 is required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A further sum of $290,000 is required in order to

retain   the  average  strength  of  234   special

constables  who will be kept on a temporary  basis

till  the end of the year, and some of whom  would

otherwise be retrenched during the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It is proposed to make a grant of $102,000

on  a  dollar for dollar basis to the Kampong  Koo

Chye  Fire  Fund. This money will be utilised  for

the  construction of flats for the  habitation  of

some  of the victims of the fire which took  place

last  April.  I should like to draw the  attention

of  hon.  Members to an amendment that  should  be

made   to  the  reference  to  Head  D  22   under

Application No. 39 in the last line of  the  first

paragraph  on page 4 of the Sessional Paper.  D.22

should  now  read D.43 as it is a more appropriate

Head  under which the proposed expenditure  should

be shewn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) On the basis of a standstill budget, only 160

additional posts (including 5 additional  Division

I)  were incorporated in the 1959 Draft Estimates.

It  was  thought that this would be  adequate  and

that   the   opportunity   would   be   given   to

reorganisation  and redeployment of  the  existing

staff  so as to achieve the maximum economies.  It

is  not  to be, for the education service is  ever

expanding.  With  the  expansion  of  classes  and

increases  in schools it has not been possible  to

cope  with  the  expanding  activities  with   the

present  staff. Additional staff will be  required

if  new school buildings are not to be kept  empty

or  new  classes without teachers. In the case  of

graduate  teachers, a number will be  passing  out

from  the  University this month  and  posts  will

have  to  be created in order that their  services

can  be engaged. It is not possible to hold  these

up  till  the  latter  part of  the  year.  It  is

therefore proposed to create the following  number

of new posts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) 40 graduate teachers,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) 50 teachers of vernacular languages,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) 102 Probationer teachers in the Malay schools, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) ancillary staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated cost of the additional staff is

$453,090.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Estimates there are eight

applications  for supplementary provision amounting  to

$1,471,325, and five applications for revotes amounting

to  $416,154. Taking the revotes first, there is a  big

item relating to the purchase of equipment and fittings

for  the Polytechnic. The orders were placed last  year

and   the  payment  cannot  be  met  from  this  year's

provision since these purchases are not included in the

provision   which   is   meant   for   the   additional

requirements  to be purchased this year.  A  revote  is

therefore required.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional provision of $120,000 is required for the

three  District Councils which have been set up in  the

beginning of the year, so that the essential health and

other  works can be carried out during the  next  three

months.  It will, of course, be appreciated that  until

the organisations have started work and have taken over

certain  former city areas it would not be possible  to

assess  the minimum requirements. Provision of  $30,000

is required for each of the three District Councils for

improvement and expansion of works in the rural  areas.

There  are  a  number of proposals for small  amenities

which  uplift  the morale of kampong and  rural  folks.

They include minimum drainage works which involve-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the placing of culverts, the cutting and widening of drains;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the removal of stagnant water;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the provision of bore holes for sanitation;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the levelling of bridle paths and foot paths;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) clearing of streams and canals; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) a host of such similar works.



<br><br>In  addition, $15,000 each is required for the  Katong

District  and  Serangoon  District  Councils  for   the

purchase of a vehicle for town cleansing purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original 1959 Estimates, in keeping with the

principle  of  a standstill budget, capital  grants  to

schools  were limited to revotes of sum voted  in  1958

but not used. This has not proved practicable and there

have  arisen four urgent cases which will  have  to  be

given  consideration now. The reasons for their urgency

are  given  in pages 15 and 16 of the Sessional  Paper.

The  total  amount involved is $302,225. It  should  be

pointed  out  that  Government is contributing  towards

half  the total cost and for each one built or rebuilt,

the Government will have one less to build.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we come to the item relating to the

Modernisation and Construction of Division IV Quarters.

A number of proposals have been put up to implement the

policy  of  constructing  institutional  quarters   for

Government officers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>



They are to be carried out in phases, and following

the need for economy in the middle of last year  it

was decided to put a stop to a number of them, some

of which would have been built but for this freeze.

No   provision  has  therefore  been  made  in  the

Estimates  for the construction of new quarters  or

renovation  of existing ones except in  respect  of

those  works  which were in construction  in  1958.

These  deferred proposals have been transferred  to

Appendix DK in the Estimates, a number of which are

meant   for   the  Division  IV  employees.   These

employees  are required to stay in their places  of

employment  and, being in the lower  income  group,

are  not  in  a position to make use  of  the  loan facilities to purchase

their own houses. It is therefore the responsibility of the Government to

house  them.  For  the  convenience  of  the   hon.

Members, I would mention a list of them:



<pre>



 (a) Broadcasting

     18 Division IV Quarters, Jurong Road               $130,000



 (b) Police

     (i)  112 Division IV Quarters, Duxton Plain.   (i) included in the total cost

                                                        of $970,000 and

     (ii) 524 Division IV Quarters                 (ii) included in the total cost

                                                        of $4.7 million.

 (c) Customs

     One multi-storey block Division IV Quarters        included in total cost $272,500



 (d) Tan Tock Seng Hospital

     Quarters 168 Hospital servants                     $1,092,000



 (e) Woodbridge Hospital and Trafalgar Home

     (i)  Modernisation of existing Attendants

          Quarters and 96 New Division IV Quarters      $800,000

 (f) Telecommunications

     (i)  15 Division IV Quarters, Paya Lebar           $ 90,000



     (ii) 15 Division IV Quarters, Jurong               $130,000



</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

 (g) Public works Non-Recurrent (General)

     Modernisation and construction of

     Division IV Quarters, Phase I                      $919,900



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the existing quarters are in bad condition;

the  rooms are overcrowded and no facilities exist  for

cooking  and  bathing,  etc. In the  interests  of  the

staff,  the improvements to these quarters and erection

of  additional  quarters cannot  be  deferred  further.

Government cannot absolve herself of the responsibility



of  being a model employer. Supplementary provision  of

$1 million is asked for so that the urgent works can be

carried out at once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $290,000 for Head 15 stand part of the

Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, can the Hon. the Chief

Secretary  give  us a satisfactory explanation  as  to

what  confidence he has and on what grounds he  has  to

disband  the  Special Constabulary at this juncture  at

the rate of 34 per month, and for their substitution by

trained police?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a fact that in almost every police

station,  the  Officer  in  charge,  whenever   he   is

approached in an emergency by people, especially  these

living  in the rural areas, will say, "We are short  of

hands and short of staff."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many open-air cinemas, although they have licences to

perform and are paying tax and licence fees, are always

visited by gangsters, who create nonsense and fights in

them,  and  as  a result the open-air cinemas  have  to

close  down.  And when they approach the  O.C. of  any

police  station, they are told, "I am sorry, we do  not

have enough men to patrol the area."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not long ago I led a delegation of farmers from

Geylang Serai. They all belonged to the Singapore Rural

Residents  Association. It had been  reported  to  this

Association by many members that poultry, fruit  trees,

vegetables and eggs were being plucked or taken away in

broad daylight by someone who was daring enough to walk

into  their gardens. When they asked him why,  he  just

showed  his arm, and said, "This is my fist.  I  demand

those things." It was reported to the O.C. of Joo Chiat

Police Station, Mr Ong Kian Tong, accordingly. We  had

a  frank and thorough discussion. We indeed owe Mr Ong

Kian  Tong  a debt. After the interview, the delegation

was  quite satisfied. But the fact is this. The  Police

patrol still could not cope with the daily increase  of

thefts,   house-breakings  and  gang  fights  in   that

particular  area. The reason is simple.  There  was  an

Exposition  going on at Kallang Airport, and  therefore

there was a shortage of staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is quite clear now, especially since

the  election  is  approaching. We know  that  quite  a

number  of  dirty  politicians  try  to  make  use   of

gangsters. We expect that the crime wave will  increase

and  not decrease. And yet at this juncture, the  Chief

Secretary   thinks   fit   to   disband   the   Special

Constabulary  who  have been well trained  since  1945.

Sir, the note says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Special Constabulary was raised in 1945 as an

interim  measure to maintain law and order  whilst  the

Regular   Police   Force  was  being  reorganised   and

trained."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the subhead Special Constabulary, we see

that  they  have  been well trained  for  such  a  long

period, and yet it is thought fit to disband it at this

juncture when the country is in need of their services.

Therefore, the Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>



Secretary  must give us an assurance and a satisfactory

explanation as to why he is confident that the  present

police  force is sufficient to maintain law  and  order

despite  the  fact  that the crime wave  is  increasing

daily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a further suggestion. Why does the Chief

Secretary  not consider another point, to make  use  of

our  own  people?  Train  them and  encourage  them  to

organise a Home Guard in every kampong and every street

to  fight the organised gangsters. With the support  of

the  Government,  we  will  have  our  own  Home  Guard

patrolling our own streets. It will not only save a lot

of  money  but  it will also raise the  morale  of  our

people. In other words, there will be true co-operation

between the police and the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish the Hon. Chief Secretary will give us a

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

very  surprised at the Government in view of the crimes

increasing  day by day. There is no denying this  fact.

You  read  the newspaper every day and you find  crimes

- stabbing  cases, gang fights. In view of  these  crime

increases,   it   is  my  opinion  that   the   Special

Constabulary should not be disbanded because the police

should  know by now (I have said that in the  Assembly)

that  there is discontent and disappointment among  the

rank  and file of the police force. This is one of  the

discontents. These people, given guard duties to patrol

the  streets  of  Singapore, have  to  look  after  and

protect the people of Singapore. Sometimes they have to

face dangers, and yet the Government see fit that these

people should be disbanded. I am really surprised, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know why crimes have been increasing.

Experienced police officers in the various divisions of

the police force, who have the experience and knowledge

of  all  the secret society members operating in  their

particular areas, have been transferred to another area

at  the  whim and fancy of the senior police  officers.

The  removal  of  these experienced detective  officers

from a division where they know the members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>



of the secret societies operating in that area, is only

to  encourage  the members of the secret  societies  to

come out into the open.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have another item - to retrench the Special

Constabulary.  Sir, I have met many Special  Constables

patrolling my area in the morning - 2 a.m., 3 a.m. and  4

a.m. They protect the people of Singapore and it is our

duty  to  see that these people who have given much  of

their  time and even their lives to protect the  people

of Singapore should not be disbanded. They should, as a

matter  of  fact, be absorbed into the  regular  Police

Force, as I feel that they have the experience to be in

the Force itself.



<br><br>12 noon.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, both the Member for Changi and the

Member  for Tiong Bahru spoke with a certain amount  of

heat,  but I am really not at all clear what  they  are

grumbling about because what the Financial Secretary is

doing on this motion is asking for additional money  in

order  that I can keep these Special Constables on  and

not disband them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is explained under the item, the intention has

always been - the hon. Members concerned know that  there

has  previously been dissatisfaction among the  Special

Constabulary - to put them on a permanent basis and  this

is  in fact what has now been done by the provision of

this  permanent Guard and Escort Unit.  The  Guard  and

Escort  Unit  will consist of certain  men  engaged  on

duties  for which the full qualifications and  training

of a police officer are not required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the incidence of crime and the ability

of  the  Police to cope with it, there is no  one  more

than  myself who would wish to see an increase  in  the

regular  trained  Police  Force  and  if  we  had   the

additional  funds  to provide for  it,  then  I  should

certainly  not be backward in coming forward  with  the

necessary  proposals;  but  in  the  present  financial

situation,  the  allocation of the available  resources

with  the different calls on available funds must be  a

matter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>



of  balance and, owing to a standstill Budget,  it

was  not possible for me to ask for an increase in  the

regular  Police Force for this year, but it is  one  of

the  needs  which  I commend to the  attention  of  the

incoming Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, we shall be glad if the

Chief Secretary will look at the explanatory note. Here

it is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This would relieve regular police personnel for duties

for  which  they  were trained. The  remaining  Special

Constables  except for 159 would be retrenched  at  the

beginning  of 1959 in a phased programme to  allow  for

their replacement by 34 regular police every month."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it not sound that it is your intention that you

want  to  retrench,  "except for  159",  those  Special

Constables who have been engaged since 1945 by you?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> By the Government, Sir - Special

Constables  "to  maintain  law  and  order  whilst  the

Regular  Police Force was being reorganised and trained

. . . Accordingly, a permanent Guard and Escort Unit of

825  officers and men was formed with effect  from  1st

January,  1959." And what are the duties of this  Unit?

They are "to perform static guard and escort duties".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to state that I am not satisfied with

the  explanation given by the Hon. the Chief Secretary.

I  hope he will answer my question. What confidence has

he  in sacrificing so many well-trained people who have

served in the Police Force - although in the name of  the

Special   Constabulary - since  1945?  Does   the   Chief

Secretary not consider that to be better experience?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I shall

try  to  explain  to the Member for  Changi.  When  the

debate on the 1959 Budget Estimates took place, he  was

very active. In fact, he was the most active Member  on

the  other side of the House. He talked quite a lot  on

the Estimates -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Do not pull my leg!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> -and this new scheme was approved

when  the  Estimates  were discussed.  Because  of  the

approval  of that scheme, 159 Special Constables  would

be  gradually retrenched, but the Government  now  feel

that  they should not be retrenched - the Government  are

now asking for more money - and that they should continue

in employment until the end of the year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, maybe the Government side

misunderstood  the purpose why I raised this  point.  I

want  the  Government to spend more money  because  the

Police Force is inadequate to provide for the needs  of

this country. I have already quoted so many examples to

prove  to  you that many officers in charge  of  police

stations  have always complained about the shortage  of

hands. I am, of course, thankful to the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  for explaining that this item was  passed  at

the Budget sittings last year, but the situation now is

quite changed, as has just been mentioned by the Member

for Tiong Bahru. He says that crimes are increasing and

that  the people are getting worried. We know  so  many

reasons coupled with that. Therefore, my purpose is  to

urge  the Government to raise a larger Police Force  to

maintain law and order. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I cannot help feeling that it would

be  very  salutary if we had a Standing Order  in  this

Assembly that Members who constantly urge Government to

spend more money should be under an obligation also  to

say where the Government is to get that money from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already said, Sir, that I am in entire

agreement with the hon. Member that, in order  to  cope

with  the  present  level of crime, we  do  require  an

expansion of the Police Force, and I do hope that  will

be  one  of  the  first matters to which  the  incoming

Government  will devote their attention;  but  for  the

present we have, for the reasons explained at the  time

when  the  Budget  was  debated, confined  the  present

Estimates  to a standstill Budget and it  is  for  that

reason



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>



that I have not been able to come forward with

proposals for expanding the Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $290,000 for Head 15 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 17-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the sum of $39,560 for Head 17

stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, as was mentioned by the Hon.

the  Chief Secretary, they intended to ask the Assembly

to   give  more  money  to  be  spent  on  the  Police.

Unfortunately,  they  could not get  it.  Now,  similar

conditions apply to this Head - Prisons. I am  sure  this

House  will  agree with me that the Borstal system  has

really  worked very well. We are more than  pleased  to

have  spent  more  money on this  Borstal  scheme,  but

unfortunately, Sir, the Government have failed  in  one

important  point.  Although  they  have  succeeded   in

reforming  and  training  such  prisoners,   have   the

Government any plans for them after they have completed

their sentences? On one occasion, I had the opportunity

to  spend a solid six hours in Changi Prison. I had  my

lunch  inside the Prison and I talked to quite a number

of  prisoners. There is a common worry and  fear  among

them. It is employment after leaving the Prison. I will

charge  the Government to look into this point  and  do

something  for them. The Government should  concentrate

on  the Borstal scheme and train and reform them. After

he  has completed his sentence, the prisoner walks  out

of  the prison. Where does he go to? Will he go back to

society  with,  he  thinks, equal status  with  others?

Because the Government do not take much notice of  him,

the people of Singapore pay little attention to whether

the Borstal system can really work and train and reform

him.  The  prisoner  is not a life-long  prisoner.  The

convict  is not a life-long convict. It is the  general

opinion  of  the  people, and it is  the  duty  of  the

Government,  to give more employment opportunities  for

the prisoners. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>



general public should adopt a new attitude towards  ex-prisoners.  I  wish the Hon. the Chief Secretary  would

consider this suggestion, and not merely come here  and

ask  for  more money to be spent on the Borstal  scheme

and  never  think of the future of the prisoners  after

they  have  reformed  and  have  received  training  in

prison.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the Member for Changi was talking

indiscriminately  about prisoners in  Changi  Gaol  and

those  detained in Borstal institutions. I am not  sure

whether  he meant that they should be lumped  together,

or whether he intended to talk purely on the subject of

this application for supplementary provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to inmates of the Borstal Institute, they

are  invariably  released provided  they  are  of  good

behaviour for some considerable time before the  expiry

of  their  sentences, and during  that  time  they  are

required  to  report and a very close eye  is  kept  on

them.  I  know of no case in which a boy in  a  Borstal

institution  has  been released from  that  institution

without  being suitably placed. If the hon. Member  has

examples that he can give to me, I shall be very  happy

to look into them, but he has not brought any such case

to my notice and I certainly know of none.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the prisoners in the Changi Gaol - the

adults serving their prison sentences - there is,  as  he

is  aware, an association called the Prisoners'  After-Care  Association  which is always seeking  for  public

support  in  every way, and I am sure  that  they  will

welcome any support the hon. Member is prepared to give

them.

<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 18 of 1959)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have the Governor's recommendation to move the following motion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resovles that the sum of $5,369,000 shall be supplied

to the Government under the head of expenditure and for the services

specified in the Schedule contained in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 18 of 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will recollect that two big fires took place in Singapore

during the last one year. The first fire broke out at Kampong Koo Chye (Lorong

3, Geylang) on 5th April, 1958, and destroyed over 100 huts and rendered 379 families,

which comprised 2,050 persons, homeless. 172 families have been accommodated in the

S.I.T. flats in the old Kallang Airport site and 12 families in Queenstown at subsidised rents.

The others are residing with friends and relatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first phase of rehabilitation has been completed and it is proposed to complete the

second and final phase, by constructing flats for sale to these fire victims. It is estimated

that the cost of each flat would be about $5,000 and any victim who wishes to purchase a

flat must pay $500 as the first deposit and thereafter pay $50 per mensem for about seven years. A lease

of 60 years at a nominal rental of $1 per year will be granted. Of 308 applications for the purchase

of these flats, involving 323 families, only 186 families can afford to pay on the terms agreed.

The others, including those who do not apply for the purchase of these flats, have asked that

part of the money collected from the public amounting to about $192,000 be distributed to them, as

it would be unfair that their share of the money be given to subsidise the cost of buildings which

would eventually be purchased by those who could afford to pay. There are 193 families or about 1,000 persons

who do not wish to have the flats. Distribution to them will involve a sum of about $90,000 and this will

be paid out of the sum of slightly over $90,000 which has been donated to the Department of Social

Welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to build 190 two-room flats at the cost of $873,000. The City Council will hand over

to Government a sum of $202,000 comprising:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) contribution from public - $102,000

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) City Council donation - $100,000



<br><br>The Government will contribute $102,000 on a dollar from dollar basis, and this amount has been

obtained under Head 25 in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 17 of 1959 and will in addition provide the

balance of $569 towards the cost of this project. It has since been learnt that the contribution from the

public received by the City Council amounts to $106,000. It is, of course, too late to ask for this additional

$4,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T will be asked to construct these flats for sale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fire at Kampong Tiong Bahru broke out on the 13th February, 1959. It has devastated an area

of 29 acres and the memories of this diaster are still fresh in the minds of the hon. Members to require

any repetition. With the assistance of all concerned, the first phase for the rehabilitation of the

victims has been completed. A total of 492 two-room flats and 239 one-room flats of the S.I.T. have been

allocated to 5,023 persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thought that the correct long-term solution to the problem at hand would be to develop the site to

provide a better standard of accommodation for the victims and to prevent a recurrence of this kind of

disaster in the area. It is therefore proposed to acquire the site and ask the S.I.T. to build low cost houses

for rental to the victims. The development will be carried out in three phases. Phase I will cover the

construction of 240 tow-room units on the lower portion of the site. The overall cost of each unit will be about $2,500

including site works. The structure will be simple but durable and wooden slabs and concrete blocks will

be used. Phases II and III will cover the development of the higher portions of the site. It involves

the construction of 500 two-room units in 7-storey buildings containing units exactly similar in plan to

those in Phase I, but having balcony access on each floor. The estimated cost per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>



unit would be $5,000 or $2,500 per single room. The additional cost in this case is accounted for by the need for piling, modern

sanitation and other ancillary works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of acquiring the site will be about $1.5 million. It is estimated that Phase I will cost

$600,000 and each of Phases II and III $1.25 million. An additional cost of $200,000 will be involved

in making up access roads from Kim Tian Road and other miscellaneous works. The estimated total cost

will be $4.8 million in respect of which supplementary provision application is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Council of Social Services has started the Kampong Tiong Bahru Relief Fund which closed on the

13th March with about $600,000 from contributions from the public. It is proposed to distribute these

proceeds to the fire victims. This will be in addition to $26,100 already paid out by the Social Welfare

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council has decided to donate $100,000 together with contributions of $38,000 collected from the

public towards this Fund. The U.K. Government has also donated $42,850. This total sum of $180,850 will be utilised towards the cost of

the building and the Government expenditure will thereby be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T. will again be asked to carry out this scheme and will assist in the other administrative

work on behalf of Government. The other financial arrangements such as the amount of rents to be charged

and maintenance costs, etc. are being worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir. I would like to draw the attention of the hon. Members to a change in the Head of

Expenditure in the printed Sessional Paper as compared with the cyclostyled copy which was first

circulated to Members. In view of the natureof the two schemes it is thought that it would be more

appropriate to show them under Head D43-Land and District Offices-instead of Treasury which is mainly

concerned with loans as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D43-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $5,369,000 for Head D43 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas (Nominated):</b> Could the Financial Secretary tell us what the square footage per

flat will be? i.e. how many square feet of space will each flat contain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> There are two schemes here. Could Mr Thomas say which of the two schemes he is referring to?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, since the cost of the schemes is different, I presume the square footage will be also

different.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> I regret I do not have the information available right now, and if the Member still

requires the information, I shall arrange for the information to be forwarded to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This provision is of some importance, Sir, it seems to me, because I have not had the

time to look it over thoroughly. But I went into the Library just now and got the S.I.T. Report for

1957-that was just after the Suez crisis and building costs had gone up-Kallang Airport, 5-storey flats with a

two-room flat gave 284 square feet and the cost was only $4,345 per flat. Here, for Kampong Koo Chye, on

a rather comparable site but probably less space taken up, we are going to pay something around $4,600 -

about $300 more - and for Tiong Bahru, the cost came to $5,000. The difference in cost is quite considerable,

and I wonder whether there is more or less square footage per flat, and how the cost is arrived at.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Sir, I have the information. It is 360 square feet per flat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure everyone in this House will welcome the scheme that Government has proposed

to house the people who have suffered in these two very disastrous fires at Kampong Koo Chye and at

Kampong Tiong Bahru. I am particularly happy to see that such energetic steps are being taken by Government

to try and solve the housing situation for all these fire victims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been approached by people who had lost their houses in the Lorong 3 area, and they told me

that the idea of two-storey flats is not particularly welcome to them because the first floor has two common

staircases serving about ten flats. They request that instead of having two flats, one above the other, it

would be a better idea to have one two-storey house for each family. In making this request, they were not asking

for bigger and better accommodation. The accommodation could be on the same area of about 500 square feet

per house. At the present moment, each flat occupying about 500 square feet will consist of two rooms, a kitchen and latrine;

but if these two rooms are placed above the other, then each family will have their own house with their own staircase.

I recommend this suggestion to the Government.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be much obliged if the Financial Secretary can inform thos House

of the approximate cost per square foot of the land for acquiring the site.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> I assume that the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru is referring to the Tiong Bahru site?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Actually it is estimated at $1.5 million to acquire the whole site.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> What is the approximate cost per square foot? Sir, what I want to know from the Financial

Secretary is this. We are going to acquire the land where the huts were burnt. Can the Financial Scretary

inform this House of the approximate cost per square foot to acquire this piece of land?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> I am sorry that I am unable to give the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru the exact figure he

wants, but the land to be acquired has been assessed by the Land Office, and we expect it to be $1.5 million.

If the hon. Member still wants to know the exact figure, the information will be supplied to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I wonder why the Members on the Opposition side should embarrass the Hon. the Financial

Secretary at all on this question when the Members who form the present Government will only remain a few

days more in the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, if I heard aright, the Hon. the Financial Secretary gave us a figure of 360 square feet, while

one of his Back-benchers gave us a figure of 500. I wonder if we can have a firm figure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> My information is 360 square feet.

<div align="center"><b>OF SECRET INCOME TAX</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INFORMATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Commission of Inquiry)</b></div>

<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to move the motion standing in my name, which

reads,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in view of the leakage of secret income-tax

information as evidenced in the Assembly debate on the

4th of March, 1959, and in view of the resulting public

anxiety regarding the safety of all the secret or

confidential information about the general public

entrusted to the Income Tax Department, this Assembly

is of the opinion that a Commission of Inquiry should

be appointed to investigate into and report on the

circumstances in which particulars of file No. 47909/GS

of the Income Tax Department became available to a

person not entitled thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members will remember that on

the  4th  of  this month, the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

disclosed  the  information recorded in  file  No.  GS/

47909. This file, I understand, is a file of the Income

Tax  Department, in the name of Mr Chew Swee Kee. This

is  what the Member for Tanjong Pagar said. I refer  to

Hansard, column 2153, of the 4th March:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Financial Secretary said yesterday that Mr Chew

never  saw  Mr  Holloway. I  know  Mr  Chew  saw  Mr

Holloway and that it was recorded in a file."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surprising how the Member for Tanjong Pagar knew

that! And in column 2155 he continued to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, the facts are there. First, for the benefit of

the Financial Secretary, we will just tell him that  we

have got all the cards on the table. Mr Chew's file is

G.S. 47909."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he said. It is rather surprising how the

Member   for  Tanjong  Pagar  was  able  to  get   that

information recorded in a confidential file. As far  as

I  know,  all  files  or documents of  the  Income  Tax

Department are considered confidential. There must have

been then some leakage in that Department, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of the Income Tax Department is to receive

accounts  from  either  firms or  individuals  for  the

purpose  of  assessing  income tax,  and  not  for  the

purpose  of  exposing the contents of any  confidential

documents  or information to any political Party.  Such

accounts,  I  say  again,  should  be  treated  in  the

strictest confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote section 6 of Chapter 166 of the Laws of

the Colony, which refers to the Income Tax Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6.-(l) Every person having any official duty or

being employed in the administration of this

Ordinance"-



<br><br>which is the Income Tax Ordinance-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"shall regard and deal with all documents,

information, returns, assessment lists and copies of

such lists relating to the income or items of the

income of any person, as secret and confidential, and

shall make and subscribe a declaration in the form

prescribed to that effect before the Comptroller or a

Magistrate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Every person having possession or control over any

documents, information, returns or assessment lists  or

copies of such lists relating to the income or items of

income  of  any person, who at any time otherwise  than

for  the  purpose of this Ordinance or with the express

authority of the Governor-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) communicates or attempts to communicate such

information   or   anything  contained   in   such

documents,  returns,  lists  or  copies   to   any

person; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) suffers or permits any person to have access to

any  such information or to anything contained  in

such documents, returns, lists or copies,



<br><br>shall be guilty of an offence against this Ordinance."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really shocking, when we read that section of

the Ordinance, how the Member for Tanjong Pagar got his

information. It is shocking in the eyes of the  public,

and  I  am quite sure the public are alarmed at such  a

leakage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a matter of another two or three months, we

are  going to have self-government. When we have  self-government, I think we certainly want a healthy  system

of the public service. We also want the highest quality

and  efficiency in the public service, and I  am  quite

sure  we also want discipline and loyalty in the public

service.  This aim, I believe, is shared by the  Member

for Tanjong Pagar. It was he himself on the 4th of this

month  who  said  that he required  it.  I  will  quote

Hansard, col. 2118, what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we expect and will enforce high standards of

efficiency, discipline and loyalty to the service,..."



<br><br>This is what the Member for Tanjong Pagar and his Party

expect if they come into power, and it is going to be a

very, very big "if"!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as officers of the Income Tax Department, it is

their  duty  to  safeguard any secret  or  confidential

information entrusted to that Department. This  leakage

has  caused much anxiety and has seriously affected the

confidence  of  the general public in that  Department.

The public now feel that the Department cannot maintain

secrecy as required by law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I am aware. Sir, every officer who joins the

Department will have to sign an oath of secrecy. I have

got  a  form  here  which I am told every  officer,  on

joining  the Department, will have to sign.  This  form

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My attention has been drawn to the Official Secrets

Ordinance (Chapter 84, Laws of the Colony of Singapore)

and in particular to Section 5 thereof which relates to

the safeguarding of official information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. My attention has also been drawn to General Order

143.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. I understand and agree that all official

information,  no matter what its security  grading  may

be, acquired by me in the course of my duties, is to be

treated  as of a strictly confidential nature,  and  is

not  to  be  published or communicated  by  me,  either

during or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>



after  my  service,  to any other person  in  any  form

whatsoever, except in the course of my official duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. I further understand that any breach or neglect of

this  undertaking  is a disciplinary offence,  and  may

also render me liable to prosecution under the Official

Secrets Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every officer who joins that Department is fully

aware  that any information that he gathers  should  be

treated in the strictest confidence, and if that be the

case,  how  come  then, may I again mention,  that  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar got his information? From what

E  can  see,  this is a clear indication of the  P.A.P.

policy - to  plant stooges here and there, to  infiltrate

here  and there. We have evidence, Sir, that the P.A.P.

have,  during  the  past year, infiltrated  into  trade

union    organisations,   and   even   schools.    Such

infiltration  has  caused a a  lot  of  labour  unrest,

damage  to  the  schools, and  even  strikes.  We  have

experienced so many strikes during these few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with the elections coming nearer and nearer, the

P.A.P. have  no other ways of infiltrating  into  such

organisations  than into the civil service.  They  know

that  they  do  not have the strength, and  their  only

thought now is to infiltrate into the civil service  so

that  they  will  be able to get information  from  the

civil  service  and use this information against  their

political  opponents. As I said, Sir, secrecy  is  very

important  and  should  be  kept  for  the  purpose  of

investigation.  Unless the public have faith  that  the

officers  of  any  department  of  the  Government  can

maintain  secrecy,  I am sure the public  will  not  be

prepared  to  pass  on information. Then  how  can  the

Income Tax Department be able to assess properly income

tax? The Department cannot do so unless the public  are

prepared  to  submit proper income  tax  accounts.  The

public  have  no  faith because the  Department  cannot

maintain  secrecy. How then can the Department  collect

the revenue arising out of income tax?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leakage has not only caused worry to the public

but  also  amongst business circles. We are aware  that

most  people  or  small  businesses  depend  for  their

business on credit from big firms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>



Now,  if  the Department cannot maintain secrecy  where

such  accounts are concerned and if any creditor  comes

to know of the account of a firm or small business that

is  not making any profit, I am quite sure the creditor

will  withdraw his credit account and that  will  incur

more  suffering or more misery to the small firms. Such

small  firms depend on credit so that they can maintain

their business. Are we going to cause more hardship  to

such  people?  Certainly not, because  if  business  is

closed down, there will not be any employment, even for

the P.A.P. stooges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk of corruption here and there, Sir. As far as

I can make out, there are four types of corruption:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Monetary corruption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Political corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Power corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Confidence corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in this particular case, within the four, there

are two kinds of corruption. The P.A.P. are politically

corrupt because they try to influence the civil service

to  get  information so that they can  use  it  against

their political opponents; and second is the breach  of

confidence  by a civil servant or servants  in  leaking

out such information, which is not proper on their part

to spill to a political party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the four kinds of corruption, these two are the

worst forms of corruption, it is rather fortunate, Sir,

that  the whole civil service is not involved  in  this

case  because, by this leakage, it is very  lucky  that

Singapore could have the damage exposed very early.  If

we  do not find out such leakage, I am quite sure  that

the  P.A.P. will infiltrate more into the civil service

and  then  it will cause damage to the whole reputation

of  the  civil  service. As I have said, not  only  the

public  but  business  circles are  worried  over  this

leakage.  The  whole civil service is also  worried  by

such  leakage.  How then, Sir, can  we  have  a  strong

Government  if politicians and civil servants  who  are

entrusted with secret information and documents  cannot

maintain  secrecy?  It  was  evident  recently  that  a

politician,  who  was  regarded  as  the  most   honest

Minister in the Cabinet, had leaked out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>



confidential or secret information which was passed  to

him by a colleague. If such be the case-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would remind the hon. Member of

one of the Standing Orders, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly shall

not  be  referred  to except upon a substantive  motion

moved for that purpose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the personal conduct on the part of the hon.

Mr Francis Thomas and therefore cannot be referred  to

except on a substantive motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged for

your  drawing my attention to the Standing  Orders.  It

was  as  a passing reference that I made those remarks,

because I was



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Even in passing, the remark is

out of order and it should be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I accept your ruling and I

will withdraw. But what I would like to say is that, if

we  have  politicians of that calibre in  Singapore  in

whom we have trust and faith and who can just leak  out

secret information, is Singapore safe enough?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is becoming very

disorderly.  Perhaps he should now turn to  some  other

aspect of his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> All right, Sir, If you so rule, I

will  try to turn round to other subjects of the speech

which refer to this leakage of income tax. I must  warn

all civil servants to be on the lookout for such power-corrupt  politicians. Unless they are on the  look-out,

they  may ask for trouble. For the purpose of obtaining

information,  politicians  or  political  parties   may

promise  heaven  and  earth, and when  they  come  into

power, will they give that heaven and earth?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already seen this happening in the City

Council. The Chief Administrative Officer, Mr  Marcus,

was  promised  heaven  and  earth  and  was  called  or

considered  to  be  the best and the  highest  esteemed

officer in the City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>



Council.  Today, we have Marcus vs. Mayor Ong  in  the

City Council. Is that what it should be?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that no political Party should influence the

civil service in order to obtain secret or confidential

information,  and, at the same time, no  civil  servant

should  disclose any secret or confidential information

to a political Party and expect promotion if that Party

comes  into power. All civil servants should  be  above

board  and  above Party politics and be  loyal  to  the

service   in   maintaining  the  faith  and  confidence

entrusted to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am quite sure, after what I have said just

now,  that  hon. Members in this House,  including  the

hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar, who is a firm  believer

of loyalty to the service, will join me in deploring in

the  strongest terms the leakage of secret  income  tax

information and will wholeheartedly support my motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to second

this  motion  standing in the name of  the  Member  for

Queenstown,  and I heartily endorse every word  he  has

said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has every now and

again  said  in  this House that he  would  expect  the

highest   standard  of  efficiency   from   Government

servants and absolutely incorruptible standards. We all

agree  with him there wholeheartedly. And yet, Sir,  he

gave  us  an exhibition the other day of how he expects

Government  servants to behave should  his  Party  come

into  power.  It  is quite clear that under  his  Party

rule,  every  Government servant would be  expected  to

give  every piece of information that would be required

by  the  Party,  no  matter how secret  it  should  be,

otherwise  he would get into very serious trouble.  How

can  he  justify in this House giving the number  of  a

secret  file - No. 47909/GS of the Income Tax Department?

Not only did he mention this secret file number once in

this House,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>



but  three  times, and I have been wondering  for  what

purpose  he did this  - to show to the world that  nothing

is  sacred to him? How can he, who so blatantly  throws

his  weight  about as if he is to be  the  first  Prime

Minister  of Singapore in the next election,  have  the

face  to  give out the file number and the  information

that is contained therein?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer I think is that he wants now to threaten

the  civil servants so that in the next two months they

should bow to his will and give him all the information

he  wants, and give them notice that they must  not  do

anything against what his Party wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let everyone of us in Singapore take heed and be

prepared  to accept the form of government that  he  or

she  can expect if he or she does not exercise  his  or

her  vote  properly.  These two  months  are  the  most

crucial in the history of Singapore. Everybody who does

not  think  in the same way as the P.A.P. does  should

come  together and have a straight fight - Party against

Party, ideology against ideology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the policy of his Party is

that  the  end justifies the means. It does not  matter

how  you  get  it so long as you get it, it  does  not

matter to them how they get into power and how they can

win  the election, so long as they do win the election.

The  dreadful part of it is that they have  managed  to

get  information - secret information - from a  person  who

holds  such  a  high and responsible  position  in  the

Labour Front, so that-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> S.P.A.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the S.P.A. have nothing to do

with it. What happened in the last debate was that  the

sole heir of the Labour Front crossed the Floor, and is

sitting opposite us

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to everyone in Singapore to realise that in

the vital next two months, he must rise to the occasion

and cast his vote according to his own conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed

with  a  very  heavy  heart that I  read  through  this

motion.  We have just heard what the mover and seconder

of  the motion said. The seriousness of this leakage of

information from an Income Tax official to a  political

Party,  is  already a well-accepted fact.  It  is  most

recoiling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what I want to point out to the House is

this. It is a waste of time to come here to deplore the

action  of someone who is so much pleased with what  he

has gained. What the people of Singapore would like  to

know   is,  what  is  the  position  of  our  political

situation today because of this leakage? What  makes  a

Government  officer  risk his career  to  pass  on  the

information?  He  knows very well, when  he  was  first

employed by the Income Tax Department, that he  had  to

sign a declaration form. May I take this opportunity to

read it aloud:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, so and so, of address, so and so, do solemnly

declare that I will regard and deal with all documents,

information,  returns, assessment lists and  copies  of

such lists relating to the income or items of income of

any  person as secret and confidential and that I  will

not,  except  in the performance of my duty  under  the

Income  Tax  Ordinance, 1947, communicate,  attempt  to

communicate  or  suffer or permit the communication  of

such   information  or  anything  contained   in   such

document,  return, list or copies to any  person  other

than  the  person  to  whom such document,  return,  or

information  relates or his authorised  representative.

Signed, So and so. Declared before me."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even a magistrate or the Comptroller of Income Tax

is  required to witness the declaration. I  tried  very

hard  to find out from the Income Tax Ordinance,  1947,

whether  there was a case to exempt this  officer  from

passing  on information to the P.A.P. and also  whether

the  P.A.P. have any right to know such a secret:  but,

Sir, unfortunately, I could find none. There are a  few

exceptional  cases:  for example, the  Commissioner  of

Estate  Duties, the Financial Secretary and the Auditor

can  obtain  information. But members  of  a  political

Party  or  even the Prime Minister of the day  are  not

allowed  to  know  everything  about  the  Income   Tax

Department. It is through the Official



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>



Secrets  Act  that  we  hold  the  confidence  of   the

taxpayers of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, it is quite clear now that the secret is

out. The file number has been quoted by the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar. He even knew of the interview which took

place,   although  it  was  denied  by  the   Financial

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to read certain passages delivered

by  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar regarding  the  civil

service. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..to remember this. Keep your politics and your

personal views out of your service."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member give the column

number?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, this is from Hansard, Volume

3,  No.  24,  dated Wednesday, 4th March, 1959,  column

2134. The Member for Tanjong Pagar said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...to remember this. Keep your politics and your

personal views out of your service."



<br><br>He  also said that the Hon. the Chief Minister was ill-advised to advise the public service how to oppose  the

P.A.P.  I  would like the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  to

explain  how  his  remarks "advise the public  service"

apply  to  the facts of this leakage, and how he  could

secure  the  services of anybody working in the  Income

Tax Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point is this. What makes this public

servant think fit to pass on this information? I do not

have  the  slightest doubt that it is  because  of  the

corruption of money. The I'.A.P. paid out a lump sum to

this  officer. I have never the slightest  doubt  about

that; and I do not doubt that power corruption is going

on. "I offer you a quicker promotion if the P.A.P. come

into  power and if I can down the S.P.A., the  U.M.N.O.

-"



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> "- and the Lib-Socs: and then I

can promote you to be Permanent Secretary even." Sir, I

tried  to  trace  the cause of this leakage,  why  this

public servant had to risk such a severe penalty if  he

was  discovered, such a risk to his career to  pass  on

information  to the Member for Tanjong  Pagar.  Does  a

national emergency require such an important leakage to

save



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>



the whole country, Sir? I shall not waste too much time

by  using  the same words delivered by the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar when he pressed for the appointment of  a

Commission  of Inquiry. He said in Hansard,  Volume  3,

No. 24, the same date, column 2149:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...in view of what the Hon. Mr Chew has done, that

there is any doubt as to the truth of what the Chairman

of  the  P.A.P. stated, and a Commission of Inquiry  is

completely unnecessary to prove the allegation! that we

made."



<br><br>Sir,  I am sure that you will notice that the Hon. the

Minister for Education was referred to as Mr Chew  and

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar said fair play  was  not

very necessary. I am not interested in a Commission  of

Inquiry, because the truth is the truth and because Mr

Chew  has  already resigned, not only  his  Ministerial

post but also as a Member of the Assembly and even from

the  S.P.A. Yet the hon. Member thinks fit  to  let  us

know  so  much more in detail. He says that it  is  not

necessary. For the national interests. Sir, no. I quote

from Hansard, column 2152:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was no crime [in other words, about the

$500,000]. No act of illegality had been committed.  We

have  not  accused the Income Tax Department  of  doing

something  irregular. In fact, we  admit  that  if  the

money  was  a  political gift, as we say it  must  have

been, then it is not liable to income tax."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. themselves admitted that receiving

the  $500,000  was  neither  a  crime  nor  an  act  of

illegality.  They  even supported the  fact  that  this

money  was exempted from income tax. And then the  hon.

Member  tried  to advise the Secretary-General  of  the

SPA., "Be brave and say, 'Yes, I have got the money. So

what?'"   Unfortunately,  this  time  the  relationship

between  the Member for Tanjong Pagar and the Hon. the

Chief Minister is not very good. Sir, it is deplorable,

because  this is not a national emergency  demanding  a

martyr,  that  our most valuable public service  system

should  be destroyed only for political party interests

and not for the national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is this. What makes the P.A.P. think

of  going  deeper  and deeper into this  $500,000?  The

leader of the P.A.P., the Member for Tanjong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>



Pagar, made a remark that there was no crime and no act

of illegality. Why do the P.A.P, not tell the truth? We

know  there are many intelligent leaders in the  P.A.P.

They  know what the situation is in Singapore. Was  the

money  from  America? Of course, dollars are  remitted

from America. Of course, an American bank is here,  and

therefore the money is from America. Sir, it is not  so

simple as that. The P.A.P. know exactly that the  money

is  not  from the American Government. I would like  to

tell  him that the Formosan Government and the Japanese

Government  have for many, many months  gone  into  the

question  of  how to make Singapore politics  suit  the

South East-Asia Organisation, how to divide our people-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must, of necessity, keep a very

close  watch  and  see that hon. Members  keep  to  the

strict  terms  of the motion. I am just  wondering  how

those  remarks have any relation at all to the  motion,

which  merely asks for the appointment of a  Commission

of  Inquiry to investigate a leakage in the Income  Tax

Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I beg your pardon. Maybe I

have  to  seek  your clarification. I  spoke  on  three

points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is this - that the P.A.P. fail to realise

the  actual political position of Singapore today. They

are  merely seeking their Party interests and  not  the

national  interests as a whole. That is  the  point  of

this motion. If I am wrong, please rule me out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise this. The damage has

already been done to the public service. Nobody  doubts

that.  I  may quote a further point. Only last Saturday

night I had occasion to meet a foreign diplomat. He did

not know that I am an Assemblyman but he knew me as  an

accountant. He is worried about his money. Sir,  it  is

an   open   secret.  The  surrounding   countries   are

corrupted, and there are corrupt diplomats and a lot of

corrupt  money.  This diplomat saw fit  to  consult  an

accountant.  He  asked, "How now, this leakage  in  the

Income Tax Department of $500,000. Now I have to submit

my returns. My accountant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>



is  so and so. He is seeking certain solutions to  help

me  out."  Sir, that is one likely ironical example - how

much  confidence of the taxpayers has been  lost  as  a

result  of this leakage of information from the  Income

Tax Department through the P.A.P. organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conclusion is this, Sir. Since the P.A.P. said

that  this $500,000 was neither a crime nor an  illegal

transaction and it was exempted from tax, because it is

a  political  gift, they were prepared to withdraw  the

motion  calling for the appointment of a Commission  of

Inquiry. They take this matter so lightly. Why? Because

they  have  already achieved their political  aim!  But

there is one thing I cannot understand - despite all  the

remarks  in  favour  of  this $500,000 - case,  yet  they

thought  fit to do nothing about the integrity  of  the

public service. That is the thing that should open  the

minds  of the people of Singapore - to take a close  look

and  analyse  what  makes the  leader  of  the  P.A.P.?

Somebody  says, "A political bankrupt"; I do not  think

it  is  true.  The  P.A.P. are the strongest  political

Party,  but if they are politically corrupt, then  they

are  power  corrupted. Although they already  have  one

foot  in the grave, yet they choose to sacrifice  their

"Marcus", the hero who passed information to the Party.

That  is  the  thing that worries me much - that  if  our

political  leaders, or our political Parties  for  that

matter,  work along the lines only for party  interests

and  not for the national interests, then we are really

doomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national movement requires the full support of

the  masses,  irrespective of whether you are  rich  or

poor,  whether you are a Malay or a Chinese, or whether

you  belong to Party (A) or Party (B). We must all stay

together to work towards full independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through this leakage, the eyes of the people of

Singapore  are open to the corruptness of the political

Parties  in  Singapore,  politically  corrupt  at   the

expense  not  only of the poor Income Tax  officer  who

passed  out  the  information, but also  of  the  whole

public  service  and  the  interests  of  the  national

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sincerely wish the Member for Tanjong Pagar is

guilt-conscious,  not  only duty  conscious,  and  that

being so,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>



he  has to reply and make a clear statement about  this



leakage.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if confidential and

secret  information leaks out from Government services,

it  is  certainly  deplorable and should  not  be, and

proper  action must be taken to see that  it  does  not

occur  again. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, I do not think

that   appointing  a  Commission  of  Inquiry   is   an

appropriate and proper action in this case.  I  believe

this  motion is purely a political motion designed  for

political  advantage and prepared to expose  the  Civil

Service  in  the interests of political  advantage.  If

there  was a genuine desire on the Government  benches,

if  there  had ever been a genuine desire that leakages

should be cleared up, there would have been calls for a

Commission of Inquiry long, long ago. There  have  been

continuous  allegations  by the  Press -  out  come  the

newspapers,  "The  Council of  Ministers  this  morning

decided   so-and-so."   There  have   been   continuous

allegations  from confidential and secret documents  in

different  Ministries; there have  been  almost  weekly

headlines  in the papers (not even headlines sometimes)

about the allegations that leaks have taken place,  and

yet   this.  Assembly  has  never  in  the  least  been

interested. It is only now, when the political heat is

coming on, that we show our keen desire that the  Civil

Service  must be properly careful with all its secrets,

and all secrets must be revealed to a public enquiry in

order that they may be more secretly kept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an enormous number of Commissions of Inquiry

in  the last few years, relatively enormous compared to

the usual practice. I fear that if we go on calling for

Commissions  of Inquiry, the whole system  will  become

ridiculous. The tendency now is to call for Commissions

of Inquiry not because there is anything useful that is

going  to  result,, but because it is a sort  of  jest,

"Look,  I  am an honest man; he is a crook:  set  up  a

Commission  of Inquiry to prove that I am right."  That

is an absurd way of behaving and brings the idea



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>



of  Commissions of Inquiry into disrepute. If there

have  been leaks, then it is for those in the Civil

Service, through the Civil Service, to stop  those

leaks and to see that they do not occur again,  and

to see that proper disciplinary action is taken. If

there  had  been a leakage it is as  well  that  it

should  be made known and preferably made known  to

the  responsible Departmental Head or the  Minister

or whoever is concerned in the Civil Service. If it

is  made  known to the public, well  that  is  less

desirable;  in my view to give publicity  does  not

help  anybody.  But certainly if a leak  has  taken

place and if an honest citizen gets to know of  it,

he  should not keep silent about it. He should  see

that  action  is  taken to stop the  leak  for  the

future.  We  have  on the Government  benches  the

Chief  Secretary and the Financial  Secretary - as  I

understand, the mechanism of the Service - they were

both concerned with a leak of this sort, and I have

no doubt at all that they would have already looked

into  it  and  are  capable of  taking  appropriate

action  to see that such things do not occur again.

If  there is a suggestion that they cannot do their

work  and the Commission of Inquiry tells them  how

to  do  it,  that  is a suggestion that  they  are

incompetent  in  their own jobs - and  that  is  from

their  own  Government supporters  suggesting  that

their own Ministers sitting with them are not  able

to  keep proper control of the affairs of the Civil

Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an enormous number of ways in which leaks

can  take  place, and they need not necessarily  be

malicious or deliberate ones. I remember some years

ago  I  was quite a new Minister going to the Chief

Minister's Office, just next door to this  Assembly

House, and seeing a secret document being typed  on

a  typing  machine  and then taken  downstairs  for

duplication in the Public Relations Office in  this

Assembly  building - what I call the Press  Room  of

the  Public  Relations  Office - on  the  duplicating

machine  down there. They had not got a duplicating

machine upstairs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>



and  had  to go downstairs, and the secret document

which is supposed to be seen by a very particularly

limited  number of people, was being duplicated  in

an  open office with pressmen coming in and out.  I

do  not know whether they got it, but there were  a

number  of  leaks  at  that time  of  quite  secret

information.  Now  in the Chief  Minister's  Office

there is a Confidential Registry - the door is to the

left   of   the   room  and  marked   "Confidential

Registry" - supposed  to  be, I  believe,  inviolate.

Nobody   goes   in   except  confidentially-cleared

people,  or  people  who have  had  their  security

checked.  Nevertheless, I have seen the  door  open

with nobody inside and I had heard two men, looking

for somewhere quiet to talk, say, "Now, come on, it

is all right." And in they went and sat down in the

Confidential  Registry and they had  their  private

conversation,  because there was no  other  private

place  to sit. What was on the table I do not know,

as  it  was  not  my business. I  am  not  alleging

anything  about those things. I made mention  about

the  difficulties  of maintaining security.  Papers

have  got  to be handled here and there:  it  is  a

continuous job and there is always a possibility of

a leak. And in what circumstances was there a leak,

if  there was a leak, about this file? It seems  to

me  that  somebody has talked out of  turn  and  it

appears  to me that the thing must be looked  into.

But  I  do not see that any advantage to the public

at  all  can  come from setting up a Commission  of

Inquiry.  I consider this motion should be dropped;

I   consider  that  the  Chief  Secretary  and  the

Financial Secretary and their Departmental Officers

should  take  proper steps to see that  no  further

leaks  of  this  sort occur; and I think  that  the

Government  benches  should  find  other  ways   of

looking for votes.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am horrified at the disclosures from the hon. Mr

Francis  Thomas - there were leakages from  even  the

Council of Ministers! He has admitted that. That is

terrible!  Things  that were important  were  being

looked at by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>



unauthorised people. What I want to know is:  what  did

he do about stopping those leakages when he was there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Set up a Commission of inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Today, Sir, with him sitting on

the  Opposition bench, I am certain there  will  be  no

further leakages.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that was clearly an

imputation, and  I  do not think the  hon.  Member  is

justified in saying that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Well, Sir, I have not referred to

him.   I   have  not  referred  to  anybody.   Possibly

Government  has taken tighter control, and there  shall

be no further leakages.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member will not

submit  to  the ruling of the Chair, then of course  he

cannot carry on. He must withdraw that imputation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> If that should be your desire,

Sir,  I do withdraw, if it implicates him. Sir, on  the

matter  of  inquiry, we must view the matter  from  the

gravity of the offence. If a certain person is going to

leak out news that probably will not harm anybody, then

I  see no reason why that matter should be taken up and

investigated  into. But if a leakage of such  important

information on Income Tax has occurred, it is a  matter

that has the whole attention of the people of Singapore

focused  on it. We in Singapore have always  said,  "We

must  trust  our  Civil  Service.  We  want  our  civil

servants  to be neutral. We want them to be  efficient.

We  want  them to be able to work well !" On the  other

hand, we deplore the public for not coming out to  help

Government.  We  deplore the people  of  Singapore  for

sitting  on  the fence; not coming out with information

to  help the Police to enforce law and order. We  blame

them  for  not  passing on information to the  Criminal

Investigation Department. But if we have such  leakages

as  this  from a Department that is sworn  to  secrecy,

then  what  will  the public think of coming  out  with

information  to the Government, when in all probability

they  will  be discovered by their enemies  the  moment

they step out of Government offices?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter, Sir, is of a very grave nature, and it

must be thoroughly investigated so that the wrong-doers

are  not  just  told  off and the matter  not  repeated

again.  But  they should be punished, and  punished  in

accordance  with  what the law stipulated.  This  is  a

case, Sir, where the Members of this House have thought

to  be of such a serious nature that it must be brought

up  with  a motion, and I am certain that everybody  in

Singapore is of the same opinion. We do not say: "If  a

person is wrong, well, other people may carry on. If it

is  wrong  to  leak out information, well, never  mind,

there have always been leakages," and so on. I think if

there  is  something wrong, and we  know  that  it  has

happened, we should find ways and means of stopping it.

We  should have ways and means not just of stopping  it

but  also of protecting ourselves. We depend,  Sir,  on

the  Income  Tax Department to collect  large  sums  of

money  for our expenditure. If the people have no  more

faith in the Income Tax Department. I wonder what  will

happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to talk about this matter of honour. I

feel  that when a person is on oath, when a person  has

made a promise to do something, or not to do something,

it is of very great importance that he should keep that

promise.  I certainly feel that a person who has  sworn

to  secrecy and then leaks out all such information  is

doing society a great harm. Such actions strike at  the

very roots of our democratic society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always have remembered the good words Westerners

say  about  the Easterners. I have heard it being  said

over  and  over  again,  that  if  you  deal  with   an

Easterner, especially with a Chinese, you can depend on

his   word.   His  word  is  as  good  as   any   legal

document - even  better. He will honour it,  even  if  it

means  a  loss  to him. And today, Sir,  we  find  that

officers  whom we have engaged to do confidential  work

leak   out  such  information.  They  shake  the  very

foundation  of  our  society!  Where  will  we  end?  I

personally feel that we must keep all that is good that

we  have. We must not allow political or personal gains

to  come  in between us, and disregard honour and  good

faith. I certainly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>



feel  that if people are weak in their faith,  weak  in

keeping  their promises, we should help them along,  so

that they are able to keep up the good old traditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way of the world today, Sir, is always for

oneself,  always for one's Party, and always for  one's

own  power. What do we get out of that? Why do I  worry

about society? Society can go its way - anywhere, so long

as  I  can get to where I want. If we do not train  the

people  of Singapore, or rather - because it is a  matter

of preservation, and not training that we need - if we do

not preserve this code of ethics, that we must keep our

promises,  then  I think we will end up with  something

very sorrowful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard in Singapore and elsewhere stories

repeated   in  the  Press,  stories  talked  about   by

travellers.  We  have  read that  in  the  Press  where

Parties  not of a democratic nature are ruling, Parties

like  the Communist Party to which the P.A.P. say  they

are  not  opposed, are having another type of ideology,

another standard of conduct. We have heard that if  you

happen to be students, you may spy on your teachers and

report  to the People's Court, and condemn the teachers

right  off. If you happen to be employees, you  can  go

along and condemn your employers publicly. Even if  you

happen to be the children of your own father or mother,

you  may  go along and condemn them too, and  then  you

will be held as heroes!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain, Sir, that we do not want such things.

Society  must be built on faith, on the faith  that  we

have for our own fellowmen, and not on a spying system,

whereby  you may not do what you think is right  to  do

without being reported. You have the fear of punishment

hanging  over your head, not knowing who is friend  and

who is foe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a department like the Income Tax Department. I

certainly  have  a very low opinion of the  person  who

leaks  out  such secrets. Such a person is leaking  out

secrets to sources or to persons to whom he should  not

be  loyal.  I  certainly believe that  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar, who offered us all this information, has

a very low opinion of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>



person who offered such information in order to destroy

those  to  whom  he  owes loyalty  or  loyalty  to  the

Government he serves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard, Sir, nowadays of what such people will

reap in the end. We know that it may be of advantage to

be  in the favour of the Party that seems to be up  and

coming.  But I would like to warn such people, and  all

civil servants, that if they are helping people, and by

helping them they are disloyal to the Government,  they

are  not  going  to  go very far. In the  City  Council

today,  Sir, we have seen with our eyes what  happened;

we  have heard that Mr Marcus is the founder member of

the  People's  Action Party. He had been  promoted  one

step  after  another until he came up to the  top.  Mr

Marcus  was  the  best  man  on  earth!  He  was   very

efficient! He was rendering the people a great service!

Under him there should be great progress! Indeed, there

should be great progress - the progress of elimination of

the people who have done them service and are now of no

further  use! Such will be the fate of all  people  who

betray  others in order to have personal gains. Let  me

say  here,  Sir,  that  if anybody  should  betray  the

Government  to  which they owe loyalty, then  the  next

Government that comes in will have no faith in him. And

if  they  have  no  faith in such a  person,  the  only

solution is the word "go" - with all the pension  rights

washed off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly feel that honesty, loyalty and all those

qualities  that we have learned and that  we  feel  are

dear  to us have always been a part of our civilisation

and  should be preserved at all costs. Today, with  the

elections  coming so near, there will  be  many  people

trying to take advantage of the situation. There may be

people  who  come along to the Assembly to say:  "Look,

you need not worry. We have all the information - all the

files,  whichever number; and we also know  that  there

have  been  conferences  behind  the  scenes  with  Mr

Holloway,   or   with   whoever  is   controlling   any

department.  Oh, we know even more. You need  not  hide

from   us.   Even   in  other  departments,   we   have

information. We have information even of a more secret



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>



nature.  I  can  give  an  example.  The  Minister  for

Commerce  and  Industry need not tell us any  tale.  We

know  even  more  of the plans. We have  the  Permanent

Secretary working for us, Mr K. M. Byrne." I have  the

greatest of respect for Mr Byrne, but when his name is

used in such a manner, when he has just left Government

service,  it  does give me a feeling that something  is

not  quite  right. I wonder, Sir, if a person  were  to

give  information  to his Party when  he  is  still  in

Government  service,  would  that  be  right?  Is  that

honourable?  However, this may not be true.  But  then,

coming  from  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar,  I  cannot

disbelieve  it. This is getting more and more  serious.

We  have heard the Member for Tanjong Pagar say: "Civil



servants, keep politics out of your work!" And  yet  we

have heard from him in the same breath: "We have so-and-so  in  our Party, a founder member, and another member

in  the Government service, very high in the Government

service. They have resigned to contest the elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is wrong to take an active part in politics

while  in  government service, and  yet  these  people,

although they may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>



or  may  not  have taken part in active politics,  have

certainly  given information. What has  the  Government

done  about  it? This is something worth  investigating

into.  But  I certainly hope that the people  who  have

always  been respected as civil servants by the  people

should keep politics away from their career, and  keep

the  information they have at their disposal away  from

politics  until such time as they have left  the  civil

service  and taken up politics. Even then, it will  not

be  right  for  them  to divulge secrets.  The  secrets

should  remain secret-secrets to which they have  sworn

secrecy!
