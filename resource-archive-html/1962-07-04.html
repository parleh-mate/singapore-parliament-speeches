<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee.





<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28-(cont.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A11, to leave out lines 40 to 43 inclusive and insert-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(b) on which

anything is written or

marked  by which the voter can he identified except the printed number  on

the back;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) which is unmarked;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) which is void for uncertainty.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out." The

debate,  of course, will range over the principle of the next clause 29 and  the

first two amendments* to that clause.



<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Amendment (i), standing in the name of Mr Marshall, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 16, to leave out from "who" to the end of line 18, and

insert "is not in favour of any of the proposals posed by the referendum or

has not understood the questions or the instructions for voting".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Amendment (ii), standing in the name of Mr Ong Eng Guan, reads as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 16, to leave out "accepts or is willing" and

insert "rejects or is unwilling".



<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last night when we adjourned, I

was  dealing with the speech of the learned Member for Farrer Park. The attitude

of his Party is vital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 670</b></font><br><br>



Yesterday  the  P.A.P. was  a majority Government, and  abstentions  would  not

materially affect the result. Today, the P.A.P. is a minority Government and the

united  Opposition  can repel attempts on the part of the P.A.P.  Government  to

deal  dishonestly  with the people. Today, every abstention on  the  part  of  a

Member on this side of the House is, in effect, a vote for the Government.  This

must  be recognised, Sir: that abstentions prevent the Opposition from utilising

the majority of Members which it now has.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.A., when it first entered this Chamber in 1959, was a subject of

P.A.P.     Government's bullying and crudities. We have now  come  full  circle.

Today  they are the arbiters of the fate of the P.A.P. Government. Knowing  that

this minority Government can only act with the support of the S.P.A., where  the

P.A.P. acts  dishonestly or in fraud of the people, the S.P.A. must  take  the

blame.  The  S.P.A. must carry the odium though it does not enjoy  the  fruits,

because it is now a fact that the assistance of the S.P.A., tacit or active, is

necessary  for  the P.A.P. to perpetrate the threatened perfidy of  a  dishonest

referendum upon our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not urging the S.P.A. to overthrow the P.A.P. Government. All I am

suggesting at this juncture is that they should be conscious, as the  people  of

Singapore  are conscious, that as from today they have the power to  resist  and

prevent  dishonest conduct on the part of the P.A.P. Government. If it  abstains

from  the  exercise of this right, it must carry the same odium  as  the  P.A.P.

Government with whose existence it is now fully associated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I want to remind you of the brave words of the Member for

Cairnhill in the Select Committee less than three weeks ago. If you will be





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 671</b></font><br><br>



good  enough to look at col. 332 of the 15th of May, there is a paragraph.  This

is what the Member for Cairnhill said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'if the answer required in the referendum is just a yes or a no and the voter

refuses to give a straightforward answer where he is given a choice of accepting

or  rejecting,  then  there  may be some ground for saying  that  silence  means

consent. But where a voter is asked [and you will notice, Sir, it is where there

is  a  yes or a no] to choose two or three things which he may not like and  for

which  he  may have great revulsion, surely he should have the right to  express

his disgust by not voting at all.'



<br><br>Mr  Chairman, then if you will look at column 376 the following day - only  one

more  paragraph, Sir, It is not my purpose to seek to embarrass but  rather,  if

possible, to clarify. It is the final paragraph. Again the Member for Cairnhill

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to unmarked votes, votes are unmarked to indicate the strong

feeling  of the voters. In the referendum that is to come, a voter might  be  so

fed  up  with the manner in which the questions are posed that the onlv  way  he

feels  he can show his intense disgust is to cast a blank vote; otherwise if  he

has  views of his own, he will know what to do with it. But in order to show his

disgust,  he  puts  in a blank vote. So a voter who shows his disgust  with  the

manipulations

of  the Government is to be treated like a man who is very friendly towards the

Government.'



<br><br>You will notice particularly, Sir, the

words there used:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...a voter might be so fed up with the manner in which the questions are posed...."



<br><br>The Member for Cairnhill had in mind

that  there  might  be  several  questions,  and  yet  he  says  there  is  this

possibility. He says quite truthfully, Sir, that this provision of clause 29  is

not  a  provision to assist confused people, but is a provision to  transform  a

"no"  into  a  "yes". He tells you that people, who cast blank votes  after  the

matter has been fully

debated, cast those blank votes out of disgust. That means they do not want any

of  the  alternatives. Yet by a legal fraud their disgust  is  transformed  into

partisanship for the Government proposal. They say no in fact, and the law says,

"You shall be deemed to say yes." A man is physically a man, but the P.A.P. law

says  you are a woman or an animal. In this case, the P.A.P. makes us  animals

according to their own image - gadarene swine.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally at column 385 on the same day, the Opposition had the pleasure,

on  calling  for a division, to have the Member for Cairnhill stand shoulder  to

shoulder  with  us  in a vote of five on the Government side  and  four  on  the

Opposition  side, the Barisan Sosialis, the S.P.A., the U.P.P. and the  Workers'

Party.  As  I  pointed out, the Member for Cairnhill had fully in mind  the  possibility  that  there might be more than one question. He knows,  as  every  reasonable  man knows, however many the questions, there are some who may not  find

any  of  them acceptable. Sir, speaking purely on principle, it is a  matter  of

elementary  decency that in a referendum which is intended to seek to  ascertain

the wishes of the people, they should be entitled to say "yes", to say "no",  or

to  say,  "We  do not care." Sir, if the Government really want  those  who  are

confused  to be assisted, let them put in a clause: "Do you want the  Government

to  decide for you?" By all means. We will go to great lengths on the Opposition

side  in  this tragic farce which the PAP, is seeking to perpetrate  on  a  very

decent people.





<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill voted for us in Select Committee, and even in this

Assembly he has uttered war-like noises towards the Government Front Bench.  The

Member  for  Cairnhill  knows that the attitude of the S.P.A.,  through  him  in

Select  Committee towards the Referendum Bill, has attracted considerable credit

for  his  Party  and,  in  fact, their image both as to his  activities  on  the

Referendum Bill in Select Committee and in other matters over the past 12 months

has  improved  to  a  remarkable extent as a result of their strong  anti-P.A.P.

stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned Member for Farrer Park, Sir, would have been both surprised and

delighted had he been present at a mass rally but ten days ago, when I think  it

was  the Secretary-General of the S.P.A. who stood on the same platform  as  the

Workers' Party, the Barisan, the Party Rakyat and the Liberal Socialists -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He was booed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And he would have been, I think, pleased at the friendly

reception  accorded the representative of the S.P.A. by some 6,000  to  7,000

people  who had come from distances and stood for hours in the open  to  hear

him -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee) </b>rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of

information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, is it not

true that the representative of the S.P.A. was booed at this meeting when  he

stood up to speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, he was at the beginning booed, it is true, by a small

section  but  as  he  warmed  up,  Sir, he received  both  cheers  and  happy

laughter.  I  remember vividly when he said, "The S.P.A. is not as  dirty  as

the  P.A.P."  He had the loudest ovation that I have heard in  a  long  time,

Sir.  That  seemed to attract the sense of humour and enjoyment of the  crowd

there, that phrase - "The S.P.A. is not as dirty as the P.A.P."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I may able to go on, Sir. Today the Singapore People's Alliance

seeks  to maintain the public image it has earned over the last 12 months  by

its  warlike  noises  in  the Assembly, with more warlike  noises  which  are

divorced from deeds. They brandish their verbal asides at the Government  and

then  vote for the very proposals they condemn. Because, Sir, I repeat,  that

in  the  context of today, to abstain from voting on the Opposition side  is,

in  fact,  to vote for the Government because it allows them then  to  escape

the  majority  verdict which we can bring to bear. Sir, with the  resignation

from  the  P.A.P. of the Member for Bras Basah, each abstention is  of  vital

importance to enable the Government to maintain its voting

superiority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just as the Member for Cairnhill was unequivocal in Select Committee

in his contempt for clauses 28 and 29 - and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 674</b></font><br><br>



seemingly, Sir, in this very Assembly - so his colleague, the learned Member  for

Farrer Park, seemed friendly to this clause although neither of them is going to

vote against or for it. The learned Member for Farrer Park inter alia asks,  "If

all  the possible alternatives are put, what objection is there to this clause?"

Mr  Speaker, I would refer to a statement made by the Prime Minister in a radio

forum  on  the 12th of June, 1962, which was broadcast on the 14th of June.  You

will  find it in page 3 of the official manuscript, it is a very short  sentence

and this is what the Prime Minister said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If you ask 624,000 voters, each man to write down what he wants you might well

get 624,000 different answers.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the answer to the Member for Farrer Park is to have two or three

alternatives  to  the merger proposals. According to the Prime Minister,  it  is

certainly not to exhaust all the possible alternatives. Sir, he knows  in  truth

and in fact that the one acceptable alternative to the Opposition will never  be

put. We will come to that at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the learned Member for Farrer Park is impressed by precedents, Sir, I

would  like  to draw his attention to Annexure II sent us by the  Clerk  of  the

Legislative  Assembly  with reference to the voting in South  Australia  on  the

subject of closing hours for bars. We have gone down to this in order to find  a

parallel for what the Government seeks. But this is one instance which  I  could

trace where the ballot paper did try to exhaust all reasonable proposals and the

question submitted to the people if you will remember, Sir, was that the closing

hours  for bar rooms supplying intoxicating liquor, should he (a) 6 p.m., (b)  7

p.m., (c) 8 p.m., (d) 9 p.m., (e) 10 p.m., and (f) 11 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even here in answer to the Member for Farrer Park where all the possible

reasonable alternatives seem to have been exhausted, unmarked ballot papers were

treated in accordance with the requirements of the Electorate Act. 1908 to 1913;

they were declared void. I would urge the learned Member for Farrer Park and his

Party to consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 675</b></font><br><br>



the  validity  of the statement made in Select Committee by his  colleague,  the

Member  for Cairnhill, whether a blank paper cast on questions which  have  been

fully  debated  and  fully made known is in fact an indication  that  the  voter

rejects  and is disgusted with the alternatives offered. I would urge that  they

recognise  that clause 29 seeks to transform what is in effect a  negative  vote

into  a  positive vote for the Government. Sir, it is axiomatic that one  cannot

play  with  filth without getting dirty. Our people are not stupid.  To  imitate

Falstaff and to shout to the bushes that they are looking for wars does not make

them  a  responsible Party if simultaneously they go into the  shadow  of  those

bushes  and  make questionable agreements to keep the P.A.P. in  office  and  to

support  the P.A.P. in the very measures which they publicly condemn. To  permit

the  deed to belie the word is not only contrary to good sense; it is,  I  would

respectfully  suggest,  bad  politics - though I do  not  speak  as  a  successful

politician.  I  do  plead in all earnestness to the Singapore People's  Alliance

that  at least in the patently foul clauses which are before us - clauses  28  and

29 - which  go  against  the grain of every decent instinct  at  least,  in  those

clauses, they should vote against the Government.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is indeed a refreshing change. For the past five days,

we  have  seen  the P.A.P. and ex-P.A.P. hammer it out without any  letup.  This

afternoon  the debate begins with the ex-Labour Front fighting in this Assembly.

But  there is one tribute I would like to pay, which the Barisan at least should

copy.  The  words  of the Member for Anson levelled at me are words  given  with

proper dignity and proper observation of parliamentary practice and, for  that,

I thank him. It shall be my duty to reply to him in similar vein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Anson will remember that at the start of this debate, I

did tell him - we are friends though we may be in different political Parties

- that the S.P.A. will abstain on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 676</b></font><br><br>

vote.



Therefore the defection of one P.A.P. Member last night had nothing to  do  with

the  stand of the S.P.A. and the S.P.A. is responsible enough not to change  its

stand  now  although  knowing that the P.A.P. is dead. We have  said  that  the

P.A.P. is dead. We are just waiting for the day of the funeral. But it shall  be

the  S.P.A. which shall declare the day of the funeral and not other Parties  of

the  Opposition. We are conscious of the grave responsibility that has now  been

thrust upon us by this defection. But in consideration of that consciousness, we

are  and  we  will always be guided first and foremost by the interests  of  the

people  of  Singapore. For all that the S.P.A. cares, the P.A.P. can  be  dead.

buried and forgotten, and for all the S.P.A. cares too, if it means the death of

the  S.P.A., let it be; the people must survive. The interests of the people  of

Singapore must receive primary consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson yesterday did say - and he said it again today - that

there  is  a volte face. The hon. Member read out with punch and vigour extracts

of  my speech against the Government Members in Select Committee. But may I  ask

him  to try and recollect that the attack was based on the then intention of the

Government  to pose two questions? The alternative to the White Paper  proposals

is something which no man in his senses would vote for and therefore I described

the  attempt to pose the two questions as a dishonest attempt. I even  went  to

the  extent  of saying that it was a fraudulent attempt. Therefore, I  was  most

bitter in my criticism against the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other Opposition Members did also criticise in no uncertain terms clause

29,  but  I  would  not  like  to say that it was  due  to  the  consistent  and

responsible   opposition  of  a  responsible  Party - the   S.P.A. - that   the

Government  has  now awakened to a realisation that any attempt  to  impose  the

fraudulent questions on the electorate would make short shrift of the Government

and  the  Party. And so they said in this Assembly that the questions  would  be

debated and settled by the Assembly after a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 677</b></font><br><br>



full, frank and lengthy debate, and they also went to the extent of assuring the

House that the Referendum Bill, when it becomes law, would only be used once and

that  as  soon  as  the referendum on merger was over, the  Ordinance  would  be

repealed.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government have tried to find ways and means to remove the strong

opposition  that  has  been levelled against them on clause  29.  Sir,  we  were

pleased  to  find  that  the Government have now changed  their  stand  on  this

particular  subject  which  is a matter of grave importance  to  the  people  of

Singapore.  We  felt that the very strong objections made by me  in  Select  Committee  were  met  up  to a point, and we maintained that  any  attempt  by  the

Government to use blank votes and uncertain votes as votes meant for Cmd.  Paper

33 was undemocratic; we feel it is still undemocratic. It is wrong to want to do

something  which is not properly and openly democratic. But, Sir, the Government

gave  us  a reason, and as a responsible Opposition we must give full weight  to

the  reason.  The  Government  say that unless  we  have  this  clause  in, the

Communists  will  be  up to tricks. The Communists do not want  merger  and  any

opportunity given to them to prevent merger should be denied, and clause 29  is

an  attempt on the part of the Government to deny the Communists the opportunity

to  wreck  merger and thereby bring misery to the people of Singapore.  That  is

what they think is the right way to fight the communists. We, the S.P.A., have a

different view. We say that if the Communist threat is genuine and is  as  grave

as the Government imagine, there is only one answer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What is that?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Put them where they cannot give trouble. Of course, the

P.A.P. Government think that will not help. Well, in a democracy one is entitled

to one's view. I still maintain that the right way is this: if you have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 678</b></font><br><br>



a  toothache, pull out the offending tooth. But the P.A.P. say: if  you  have  a

toothache,  leave  the offending tooth in; let us try and find some  legislation

whereby  we  can  make a toothache no longer a toothache. That is  the  P.A.P.'s

view.  They are entitled to have their fun if they want fun. They are,  as  they

claim  to  be,  fighting in the interests of the country against  the  Communist

threat.  Sir, as a responsible political Party, and myself as one  who  has  had

many occasions in the past to meet and counter this Communist threat, I find  it

would  not be in keeping with our responsibility if we were to make the  job  of

the  Government more difficult. It would be more difficult if we  were  just  to

continue  taking the same line as we took in Select Committee in  spite  of  the

fact  that  the Government have changed their ways and are trying to mend  their

ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that it is wrong of the Government to try to meet the Communist threat

by  clause 29. But because the interests of the country demand that it should be

looked  after  by  the  government of the day, we  are  prepared  to  allow  the

Government to have the chance to play the game, the game that they want to play

with  the Communists. And therefore we abstain. We do not feel strongly  against

or for, especially as the reasons for objection have been removed. But we cannot

vote with the Government on clause 29 because we say that that is the wrong  way

to  meet the Communists. Because we do not agree with them that the way to  meet

the  Communist  threat  is  to  have  a cat-and-mouse  game, therefore  we  are

abstaining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson hopes that the S.P.A. will seek to maintain the

public  image  of  a warlike attitude towards the P.A.P. Sir,  the  S.P.A. will

always  be  conscious of its duty and responsibility in maintaining  the  public

image  of  a responsible political Party which is not prepared to work with  the

Communists  to  wreck  merger, not prepared to work with a dead-  government  to

perpetrate any acts that are inimical to the interests of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 679</b></font><br><br>



But so long as the Government wake up and realise that they have many sins which

they have to purge if they want to remain in office, and so long as they make an

honest  effort to atone for their sins, the S.P.A. will not be a Party  fighting

shoulder to shoulder with the Communists to wreck the interests of the people of

Singapore.  We  feel  no pride, no pleasure whatsoever in fighting  shoulder  to

shoulder  with Communist and Communist front organisations just for the pleasure

of killing a Party that is already dead. The P.A.P. need not be killed any more.

It is dead. The S.P.A. will fix the date of the funeral.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we have always maintained that the S.P.A. and the P.A.P. are

one  in  many  aspects, and they will work together on all the important  issues

that face us today.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When you were in the Lib-Socs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Member for Cairnhill talked about pulling out teeth when there is a toothache. If we

should start pulling out teeth just because there

are toothaches, then I do not think he will have many teeth left by the time he

reaches 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dentures, man!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No wonder he is

wearing  dentures  today.  All  of us know that the  proper  treatment  for  any

toothache is not extraction. It is something else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson said that the

S.P.A. are incapable of making up their minds. I do not think that is a correct description. Sir. They know how to make up their minds, but they make up their  minds  only  at a time when they find the situation favourable  to  themselves. I am very glad, Sir, that the Member for Anson quoted to you what the Member for Cairnhill said in col.

332. I will not quote that again. Sir, but I would like to quote col. 375 of the

Select  Committee's deliberations on 16th May. It is somewhere in the middle  of

the first paragraph. The Member for Cairnhill said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 680</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Compulsory voting does not compel a citizen to do something which he does not

like to do...'.



<br><br>That is a very reasonable attitude to

take. And we admired him for that.

In the next paragraph, the Member for

Cairnhill again said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But the citizen after getting his ballot paper can still cast a blank vote to

show his intense dislike of what is going on.'



<br><br>Here is a hero standing up for the rights -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Of the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - of the voter. And we again admired him for that. Then

in col. 376, somewhere between the upper third and the lower two-thirds, he said

this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, that "Down with the PAP.!" means "Up with the P.A.P.!"'



<br><br>by  the  way the P.A.P. wanted to turn blank votes into "support P.A.P."  votes.

And  to prove that he had been Chief Minister at one time and that he also knew

something about the law, he said (further down in the second paragraph)  he  was

quoting section 48 of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...it is clearly stated that the legal interpretation for uncertainty is

that it is void, that which is uncertain must be void legally and morally.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such beautiful and brave words, Sir. And in the next paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Coming now to unmarked votes, votes are unmarked to indicate the strong

feeling of the voters.'



<br><br>I agree with what the Member for Cairnhill said. And:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the only way he feels he can show his intense disgust is to cast a blank

vote;

otherwise...'.



<br><br>now, these are very important words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...otherwise if he has views of his own, he will know what to do with it. . .

.  So a voter who shows his disgust with the manipulations of the Government  is

to be treated like a man who is very friendly towards the Government.'



<br><br>And  one  more quote, Sir, from col. 378, paragraph 2. The Member for  Cairnhill

said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That would, I submit, be less heinous in the eyes of the people.'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 681</b></font><br><br>



In  other  words, Sir, all the manipulations of the Government are  heinous  and

indefensible  from  any angle, legally or morally. Yet you see  the  volte  face

today of the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last few days, Sir, we have been attacking the Government on this side

of the House for the dishonesty and non-democracy about these blank votes. There

was no protest from the

S.P.A. They laughed; they nodded; they agreed with whatever we said. Even  their

Secretary-General, Mr Lee Kim Chuan, said in the University forum, and again in

a rally in Anson, that the P.A.P. is much dirtier than the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The S.P.A. is never dirty.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And the Member for Anson mentioned that Lee Kim Chuan got a

great  ovation for those words which he uttered. But now, see what had happened?

Why this sudden change! Why? That is right, why?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> There is no way out for you, that is why.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you will remember, Sir, the change occurred very soon

after  the  announcement that there was no more a majority P.A.P. Government  in

the House. The S.P.A. has vested interests in keeping the P.A.P. alive and wants

to  make  sure that the P.A.P. Government do not topple as they will if all  the

Members  on  this side of the House were to vote against them  it  would  be  26

against 25 and the Government would be no more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Fat hopes!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Therefore, it would he difficult for the Member for

Cairnhill to declare openly his support for the Government, especially after all

those brave words that he uttered in the Select Committee and all these last few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 682</b></font><br><br>



days. I  met him on many occasions outside this Chamber, Sir, and every time he used

to  say to me, "Damn the P.A.P.!". [Interruption] I would like him to deny that.

He  said, "We must vote against them. Yes, all of us must vote against them." He

said  that.  Dare  he  stand  up  and say that  he  did  not  say  those  words?

[Interruption] Since he dare not -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown said, "Let us

fight  and damn them." I said, "The P.A.P. are already damned. There is no  need

to  damn  them any more. Let us fight together." Sure we want to fight together.

But  I  will  say this: The S.P.A. will never fight together with the Communists

nor with Communist front organisations so long as I am alive.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> By that he implies that the Member for Anson is a Communist

or  a pro-Communist, the Members of the U.P.P. are Communists or pro-Communists,

and  all  the  members  of  the other Parties like the  liberal  Socialists  are

Communists I am sure - he will not say that Mrs Leon Soh is a Communist or a pro-Communist  - the Party Rakyat or the United Democratic Party are Communists  and

pro-Communists. Surely the Member for Cairnhill is not so naive. Everybody knows

that he is an expert in politics. He has managed to keep himself alive after more

than  14  years when he should have - like so many of the others who came  and

went  been  lost  in the limbo of time long, long ago. He has managed  to  keep

himself  alive because somehow or other he has learnt what to do at the critical

stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You do not!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Learn from him!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is entitled to vent his

annoyance  at the action of the Member for Cairnhill. But I think  we  have  had

enough of it. Let us come back to the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 683</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying, Sir, that since the S.P.A. dare not support

the  P.A.P. openly, they want to support the P.A.P. secretly and surreptitiously

and  they do that by abstaining. I would not say that it is possibly because  of

certain orders that the Member for Cairnhill has received. I do not know, Sir, I

do  not  have  the Special Branch at my beck and call to tap telephones, but  I

believe  there  must  be some message gven to him. Otherwise  how  could  he  so

suddenly somersault? I never believed that he could do a thing like that, but it

has happened. It is my guess that he received some message from some quarter.  I

leave the guessing to the public.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I got it from Peking!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the excuses which the Member for Cairnhill gives to

justify  his turnabout cannot deceive anybody. His contention is that since  the

questions are known, therefore, everything in clause 29 is acceptable.  I  might

also  mention  that  the Member for Farrer Park himself  contends  that  if  the

questions  were acceptable, then the blank paper clause would be democratic.  If

you  want to know how the blank paper clause came about, you must come  back  to

the  devilish plot of the P.A.P. to pose two unacceptable questions, knowing the

general  reaction to those questions would mean throwing in uncertain  or  blank

votes.  Then  and then only can you understand how this blank vote  clause  came

about.  Knowing  the  questions does not make the  blank-paper  clause  more  acceptable. Is it the contention of the Member for Cairnhill that just because  unacceptable questions are made known, therefore they can be changed to acceptable

questions?  Is  he also trying to do a turn of dialectics like the  P.A.P.,  to

turn no into yes? It is the same reasoning. Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park also made great play of parliamentary democracy,

saying  that it is the duty of the voter to vote. Surely a person can only  vote

if  the questions are acceptable to him and the alternatives posed  to  the

voter are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 684</b></font><br><br>



also  acceptable. I have already quoted what the Member for Cairnhill said. Surely  they  are  not  going  back on those words. When you talk  of  parliamentary

democracy, you must remember one thing. It is not the institution that fails. It

is the human material that fails. I quoted the other day from the proceedings of

the London Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. There they tell us exactly why

so  many  democracies in Asia have failed. They have failed because the  people

who  came to power misused and abused that power to destroy the very foundations

of democracy itself. In Singapore we are faced with the same danger. Let us hope

that  the  Government Ministers may yet wake up in time to preserve for  us  the

parliamentary democracy that we all want to preserve.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

whether we are democratic or undemocratic in having the provisions contained  in

clauses 28 and 29 can he tested from first principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the principle that the people should at periodic elections elect their

representatives who have then the mandate to govern for a fixed number of  years

in  accordance  with  their programme and policy, is generally  accepted  to  be

democratic,  although  of  course Communist deride this  form  of  democracy  as

bourgeois. Therefore, it is completely democratic for the Government within  the

constitutional process to carry out its mandate to bring about merger  with  the

Federation of Malaya. In doing so, we are not obliged to and need not refer  the

matter to the people. Indeed, there are no constitutional provisions for such  a

reference back to the people; hence this Bill has become necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government having considered the whole situation, decided that it

was  in  the  long-term interests of the people to give them an  opportunity  to

express  their  choice of the possible practical alternatives in  the  mode  and

manner of merger, either in accordance with what has been agreed to in the White

Paper, or  in  the  words of the Member for Anson "complete  and  unconditional

merger" on the basis of a State equal to any of the eleven States of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 685</b></font><br><br>



the Federation. In this way, any lingering doubt there may be in the mind of any

voter as to whether he would have got something better by having complete merger

will be dispelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the voter when faced with his choice is unable to make up his mind, then

surely it is the duty of the Assembly to make up the mind of the voter for  him.

The  voter  has been given the right to exercise a choice between two  forms  of

merger, one propounded by the Government and supported by 33 votes  to  nil  in

this  Assembly,  the other propounded by the Barisan Sosialis who  talk  of  the

Penang  and  Malacca type of merger, the United People's Party who talk  of  the

Johore  type,  and  the Workers' Party who talk of "complete  and  unconditional

merger".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can there be anything undemocratic about asking a citizen to indicate his

choice  to  help the Government resolve the question of the mode and  manner  of

merger? If he does not indicate his choice, surely it is not suggested that  the

Government  should remain undecided! Surely the Government must then proceed  in

accordance with the wishes of this Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man fully understands the alternatives and indicates his choice showing

which he prefers, but further wishes to indicate to the Government that his vote

should  not  be  counted, then he can write his name and address on  the  ballot

paper and thereby invalidate his vote for the purposes of the count.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown has moved an amendment to clause 28 (b). He

wishes it to read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'on which anything is written or marked by which the voter can be identified

except the printed number on the back;'.







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>as against what is in the Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'on which the voter has indicated his vote and has written or marked anything

by which he can be identified, except the printed number on the back;'.

<br><br>Sir, he could not have missed the distinction between his amendment and what  is

in  the Bill, namely that in the Bill a person must first indicate his vote  and

then  by  writing his name and address on the ballot paper by which  he  can  be

identified he can get his vote rejected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 686</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process requires that the man knows what the issues are about and also by

his  making the choice indicates what the Member for Anson so fears that he does

not know the process of the vote. Having indicated that he knows the process  of

the vote, he can then proceed to identify himself and nullify it.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General has advised the Government that clause 28 (b) has

given expression to this intention, that those who understand the issue and have

made  their  choice, and write or mark something by which they can be identified

will have their votes rejected. The S.A.G. has further advised that in Singapore

a  man  can identify himself only by writing his name and address. That  is  the

intention of this section and the interpretation that will be given to it. It is

one  thing  by  rumour - false and malicious - to get people  to  throw  in  blank

ballots.  First,  if  rumours were spread around that those who  exercise  their

choice  run the risk of losing their citizenship it is not impossible to  get  a

situation where large numbers of confused people, misled by rumours, would throw

in  blank votes. But it is a different matter to mount a campaign to explain  to

the  voter  rationally and logically that it is his duty to express what  he  decides  is  the  better of the alternatives. Having done so and  proved  that  he

understood what it is all about, he can then put his name and address on it  and

have  his  vote rejected. If Members of the Barisan Sosialis are confident  that

their  supporters are so enraged at the prospect of merger, either complete  and

unconditional  or  with local autonomy in education and labour,  then  they  can

prove  it  by using the process open to them under clause 28 (b). The fact  that

they have remained silent on this indicates that they know full well they cannot

get  the people to understand rationally the issues, fulfil their duty under the

law, and then state that they do not wish to be counted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I think nobody doubts whether blank votes are counted in or

counted  out,  the result will be the same. But if we allow blank  votes  to  be

counted out separately, then we are going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 687</b></font><br><br>



make  it profitable for the Communists and their stooges to mount a campaign,  a

calumny  and  falsehood for blank votes, in order to pervert the democratic  process  and  detract  from the psychological victory that will be  scored  against

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has quite rightly pointed out that we

can  be  defeated on this issue. I think it is as well that the position in  the

House is as it is today. It is not at our complete will and power to bring  this

about.  We intend to do what is right and what is our duty by the people in  the

country. I say we shall see this referendum through because there is too much at

stake otherwise. He, Mr Speaker, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> For the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, not for the P.A.P., Mr Speaker, Sir. The P.A.P. had

an  easier  and  softer alternative, to lead the united front at the  behest  of

those   who  are  now  manipulating  the  Member  for  Queenstown,  or   another

alternative,  to play the other way, like the Member for Cairnhill  has  played,

where  there is no more time for humour, because the chaps who would have  booed

and  laughed would have been absent from the mass rallies. We have taken it upon

ourselves to pose the real issues to the country. Whatever else we may have done

or not done, we have posed the real basic problems of the country to the people.

They will be resolved either by the consent of the people, living peacefully and

harmoniously,  a  society  of many races, in what we  now  know  as  Malaya  and

Singapore,  or willy-filly by a reunification which will take place  under  much

greater  stresses and strains. That is the price we pay for carrying this  load.

It is not for the

P.A.P. I suggest to Members opposite that if they can bring themselves round  to

defeat  us,  we have nothing else to do but constitutionally to go back  to  the

people. But I am confident, and so is the Member for Anson, and that is the  reason  why  he can take this line because somebody else he thinks will  carry  the

load and carry the can for him. But this time let me explain to people like him,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 688</b></font><br><br>



this   is  the  final  settlement  with  nationalists,  not  with  the  colonial

Government, and nationalists settle not only with the Communists but with  their

fellow-travellers.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I came over to the Opposition side because I am

not  satisfied  with  clause 29 of the Bill. I read  from  the  newspapers  this

morning  that  the  Prime Minister of Singapore had issued a statement.  In  the

statement  he said that I was under pressure, and as a result, I have  lost  the

courage to struggle. There is another paragraph in the statement which says that

it  is a matter for regret that Madam Hoe Puay Choo should have lost her courage

to  struggle at this late hour. Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to tell this House that

I  am not under any pressure from any quarter. I am not satisfied with clause 29

and other reasons connected with the P.A.P. If you say that is pressure, that is

the  pressure  in  the  interest  of  the  people,  and  the  pressure  of  this

undemocratic  clause 29. As a matter of fact, I yesterday conveyed my  intention

to leave the

P.A.P. to the Chairman of the P.A.P.

I  also  issued a statement to the Press. I do not know whether there is  enough

space in the Press or not, but my statement was given only a small space in  the

Press.  I  shall  give my statement to the reporters later on. I  am  not  under

pressure  from any quarter. If it is for the interest of the people, I will  not

mind  all  the  sacrifices. I will strongly struggle for  the  interest  of  the

people. But when I discovered the undemocratic provisions of this clause  29,  I

suspect  the scheme of the whole merger proposals and this Bill. What  are  they

trying  to  scheme?  It is because of these reasons that I  cannot  sit  on  the

Government  side and support the Government by giving it lip service  while,  on

the  other  hand, I am thinking otherwise. I can say that I oppose  the  present

policy of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to make a short speech. The

Member  for  Queenstown alleged that we changed our stand last evening  when  we

knew of the defection of the hon. Lady who has now crossed the Floor and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 689</b></font><br><br>



sat  with us on this side of the House. But I have said in my speech just  now,

in  reply  to  the  Member  for Anson, that I did  tell  him  as  far  back  as

Wednesday,  I think, at the beginning of the sitting of this debate,  that  the

S.P.A. would abstain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. I did also explain the reason why we are abstaining.

It  is  because we have received satisfaction that the questions to be posed  in

the  referendum  will be questions fully debated and accepted by this  Assembly.

Sir,  the  hon. Member for Queenstown is very fond of quoting from the  Official

Report.  May  I  follow his footstep and just quote column 474 of  the  Official

Report  of  Select Committee [No. 7], dated 17th May, 1962, where Dr  Goh  Keng

Swee  -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Even in quoting, the Member should say "the Minister

for Finance".



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir. At

column 474, the Minister for Finance said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, the Minister for Health and Law has said that some people's skulls are

so thick that no light can penetrate and no amount of clarification can convince

them.'

<br><br>The Member for Queenstown replied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us assume that I have a skull that thick.'



<br><br>I  shall now assume that the Member for Queenstown has a skull that thick, and I

shall not waste time trying to explain to him why the S.P.A., in the interest of

the  country and having received satisfaction from the Government, is abstaining

on this vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to trespass on the time of the House

for  only a few minutes. The Prime Minister has made a statement which he  knows

is untrue, having known me for a very long time. He has suggested that I am associated with this attack on the Referendum Bill because I know others will  carry

the  can of supporting the Government. Sir, it is not unknown to Members of this

House  who  have  been  for some time in politics, that in  fact  in  the  past,

particularly on one outstanding occasion when I returned from a trip overseas, I

found that the Labour Front was committed to the repeal of the Emergency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 690</b></font><br><br>



Regulations.  To  our  surprise - astonishment, more than surprise - we  found  ourselves  in  the  Government  and  we met very strong  representations  from  the

Federation  and our own Police and the Colonial Secretary as to the  dangers  of

repealing  the Emergency Regulations, it was put to us - the Member for Cairnhill

is  here to confirm it - that we could let others carry the can; we could move  in

this  Assembly  to repeal the Emergency Regulations, and the Governor,  by  his

powers  under  the Constitution, would reimpose them. I was rather horrified  at

the  suggestion that anybody could be so dishonest, so hypocritical and  refused

to  do it. I carried the burden myself, as you may well remember. Sir, that  was

an  unfair  suggestion. I would like to say this, and I want to say it  briefly

because I understand there will be a no-confidence motion urged upon this  House

in  the very near future. I honestly believe that the way the Government are proceeding now is inimical to the welfare of the people of Singapore and to the welfare  of those with whom we hope ultimately to be associated - the Federation.  I

am  aware, Sir, that at the present juncture there is a certain state of flux in

politics  and  if  there were a general election certainly the P.A.P. would  be

dead. That is true. I do not agree with the Barisan's confidence that they would

succeed.  Far from it, Sir. Unfortunately, I cannot say that the Workers'  Party

has  any  hope of leading the Government, Sir,I seek to be pragmatic  in  these

matters,  and  it may well be that there will be a large number of Independents;

certainly a growth in the S.P.A. and possibly some other Parties, if the  S.P.A.

continues  as  it  did in the past. But I agree that there might  be  a  certain

amount of confusion. But, Sir, whatever the political picture may be, and taking

it  at  its  very  worst,  the possible confusion that  may  eventuate  from  an

immediate  general election, I say to you in all earnestness, I do not  consider

that  it  could possibly do more damage to the people of Singapore than what  is

being  perpetrated  today by the P.A.P. So let us face it. I  am  attacking  the

Referendum Bill because I sincerely believe it is wrong to cheat the people even

if  you think it is for their welfare. That Jesuitic casuistry, Sir, can  do  immense and irreparable harm to our efforts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 691</b></font><br><br>



to  bring about respect for the democratic process. I sincerely believe that  it

would  be  for the welfare of the people of Singapore in the long  term  if  the

proposals,  which many want, could be put honestly and fairly. If  accepted,  my

Party and I - and  I  know  the minority who would then have voted against it - would  accept

loyally  the decision and the breach would be healed by virtue of the  principle

that  in  a  democracy  the minority accepts the will of the  majority.  If  the

proposals  are rejected, I say I do not agree with the assessment of the  Member

for Cairnhill that that would arouse antagonism, anger, and military conquest of

Singapore as suggested by the Prime Minister. I am convinced that the Federation

Government,  with the experience and the wisdom it has shown in  the  last  five

years  of  government, will necessarily immediately reopen negotiations with  the

new  Government of Singapore which wou1d provide a basis for an acceptable  integration  of  this area in the Federation. It is a matter of irresistible  logic.

That  they have now awakened to the tremendous value, not merely value, but need

of  Singapore  as  an  essential part of their concept of a  great,  viable  and

balanced nation. I am convinced that that must be so, Sir.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us go on now to perhaps the briefest speech which the Prime Minister

has ever delivered in this Chamber. Mr Speaker, I enjoy ability wherever I find

it, and strongly though I feel about our Prime Minister in many ways, not merely

in  his  political  views,  I must say that I have genuine  admiration  for  his

intellectual  acumen and manoeuvrability, for his intellectual  flexibility  and

for  the suavity of his presentation. But comparing last night's performance  of

the  learned  Member  for Fanner Park with this afternoon's performance  of  the

Prime  Minister, I must say that the learned Member for Farrer  Park  comes  out

better.  It is certainly not the most creditable performance the Prime  Minister

has  given, and it is understandable. For whatever the ambitions, the  lust  for

power,  there cannot be absent from that much ability a modicum of human feeling

and human decency which must rebel at the thought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 692</b></font><br><br>



of  prostituting his ability to the justification of something so  foul  as  the

provisions that are now under discussion. You can understand that he  wanted  to

make  the agony short and quick. He suggested to us, Sir, that the proof of  the

cake  is  in the eating and that his Government has the constitutional right  to

carry  through  its  mandate for merger and that  it  has  no  duty  to  seek  a

referendum. Sir, it is unfortunate - and I trust you will forgive me here if I  do

make a passing reference to the fact - that the Prime Minister is not present with

us  during  the  course  of  the debate and does  not  inform  himself  of  what

transpired. He might have found it interesting to reflect on the analogy I  gave

of the merger proposals and the P.A.P. proposals in Command Paper 33

- the story of Chin Shi Wang and the deer and the horse. It is not a merger,  and

the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. who are supporting him state quite frankly and honestly,

"This  is a step to closer relations which we sincerely believe in. But we agree

that  it  is  not a merger. It is a step towards merger." That is  a  clean  and

straightforward approach. But the P.A.P. have not a mandate for this step,  Sir,

nor  have  they, in fact, any real mandate at all. But assuming they have,  Sir,

they know and we know what we understood by merger, and here, Sir, I will merely

briefly touch on it because it will be debated in full. If you remember the Paid

Commission's Report on the Federation Constitution, I think, Sir, it  was  1956,

there  was  a  passage where they said, "We must urge that  there  is  a  common

citizenship in respect of all those who have citizenship rights today in all the

States."  I shall be quoting, Sir, chapter and verse when we come to the  issue

itself.  I  have not got the document with me at the moment. You can understand,

Sir,  we all understood, and I am sorry to be repetitive, what we all understood

by  complete merger, which he charges the Workers' Party with and in respect  of

which  we  are  not  a  bit ashamed - complete and unconditional  merger.  We  all

understood that was understood by the Reid Commission and what transpired during

the  formation  of the Federation was that all those who had citizenship  rights

became  citizens  of the new central entity. To say that he is giving  an  alternative and yet not putting an alternative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 693</b></font><br><br>



which  the  Barisan  and the Workers' Party want, and yet  not  permitting  the

Barisan  or  the Workers' Party to word that alternative because  he  says  the

alternative  is  a  dishonest one since it seeks a super  merger  and  that  is

something  we cannot get. That may or may not be true, Sir. But the  point  is,

if  he does not want to put our alternative, whether it is dishonest or honest,

do  not  say  that you are putting an alternative. He is, in fact, not  putting

the Opposition alternative at all.

But even if he were, Sir, who are the Opposition or the Government to say that

we,  who  have been elected, and elected by majorities, in our divisions,  know

what everybody wants in a matter that affects their future and posterity? It  is

surely  a  matter of elementary justice to permit a man to decide  for  himself,

where it is so simple to permit him to do so; since you are putting a referendum

give him the right to say yes or no. Do not seek to speak for him yourself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, he has drawn attention to clause 28 (1) (b) of the Referendum Bill.

Yesterday, you will remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, I drew attention to it  at  some

length.  I ask why there was a change from section 48 (1) (c) of the Legislative

Assembly  Elections Ordinance to this curious additional element  that  he  must

first  mark  his  vote. The Prime Minister tells us because the man  must  first

indicate  which he prefers, then he can sign his name and address, and  then  we

will  be  prepared  to  treat  it as void. Mr  Speaker,  as  it  stood  in  the

Legislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance, and as it stood  originally  in  this

very  Bill, it has been stated that if a man indicates by writing his  identity,

surely that would have been enough and that might enable the man to say that  he

can  say 'no' that way. But here you are asking him to vote in favour of one  of

the  two  alternatives.  Mr Speaker, if he is in  favour  of  one  of  the  two

alternatives, what does he want to go and sign his name and address in order  to

void  his  vote  for? It is only when he is not in favour of either  alternative

that  we  seek for him the right to say 'no', or at the very worst, to void  his

vote. You will notice, Sir, and I can tell you this-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 694</b></font><br><br>



I have been in some elections - it used

to  be interpreted that if a man marks anything on the ballot paper whereby  he

can  be  identified, for example if there is a handwriting, he says, "I  do  not

like  the  Barisan  Sosialis," well now, you do not know who wrote  it.  But  it

always  used  to  be  interpreted that any handwriting can  give  away  a  man's

identity, and that is deemed to be void. Sir, not only must you write your name,

according to the Prime Minister who says, "Now this is the way it is going to be

interpreted", but you must also write your address and, in addition to  it  all,

you  write  your name, you write your address, and then you write which  of  the

alternatives  you want. Quite apart from anything else, Sir, do you  think  that

the  people of Singapore who have struggled for and respected the secrecy of the

ballot  because of the protection from intimidation by those in power  would  be

prepared, even if all other conditions were acceptable, to write their names and

addresses and subject themselves to reprisals by the Government? Because if  you

want  to  say  'no'  then  there can be no secrecy.  The  essential  part  of  a

democratic vote is the secrecy. The Prime Minister asks now that we should

educate the people first into casting a vote, which they want, then into signing

their names, then putting their addresses; before it can be treated as void.  To

these  depths has a great intellect descended and degenerated. He says  that  in

this country, by rumours, large numbers of confused people may cast blank votes.

Well, the P.A.P. has done its share of seeking to confuse the people. It must be

recognised that it certainly has at its command far greater forces of propaganda

than  any  other  organisation,  and that it  has  utilised  those  forces - Radio

P.A.P. - its power of coercion of the Press, to very considerable effect  for  the

purpose  of confusing the people. But the issue, Sir, is this: Is a person  whom

his political opponent alleges to be confused, is such a person not entitled  to

vote? That is all it is, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in fact, what the Prime Minister is propounding is that only those who are

prepared to vote for the Government are entitled to vote, and everybody else



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 695</b></font><br><br>



being  by definition confused is not entitled to vote, we have reached  a  stage

not  of guided democracy, but of unique dictatorship unknown even in Fascism  or

in Communism.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, Sir, he is not here to explain to us wherein is the flaw of the

logic  I  seek to propound. Maybe I am in error myself. I must confess  to  you,

Sir,  I cannot see it, and I am a little distressed that such specious arguments

should  be enunciated, for the man, whatever his other failings, is not  lacking

in  acumen  and understanding of logic. It has been a pathetic display  of  pure

naked power politics, the power that is in the barrel of the gun which they love

so much. Truth does not matter, logic does not matter. We have got the power, we

can  use the legalistic smokescreen, the Press and the radio to fool the people,

as  many  as can be fooled; and the majority who do not like it, well, they  are

disorganised and they cannot do anything, and they can jolly well lump it.  That

is, in effect, P.A.P. democracy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have been labouring on the same points time anytime again.

Perhaps we can begin now to wind up the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin)</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Member

for Tanglin will say what he wishes to say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first  of all, I woud like to answer the charge that we are  pro-P.A.P.  I

feel  that there are people who would like politics to be argued along lines  of

being for one Party or another Party. Many would like us to be pro-Barisan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that when the pay cut issue came up in this House, the

Barisan  people were in the P.A.P. and they were for the pay cuts  and  we  were

against  the pay cuts, against the whole P.A.P. and the Barisan. Then  when  the

Member  for  Hong Lim got into trouble, Sir, if you will remember, and  we  felt

that he was being persecuted beyond what he should, we opposed the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 696</b></font><br><br>



move. So today, because we are standing for what we believe to be right for this

country  and what is best for the welfare of the people, and because we  do  not

agree  with the pro-Barisan line, they now say we are pro-P.A.P. Sir, our  stand

has  been  consistent. Wherever there is wrong, we oppose it. Wherever there  is

right, we support it. Wherever there is doubt regarding what is right and wrong.

Sir, it is only right that we abstain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so many thousands of words have been poured out from this Assembly on the

blank  votes issue, the referendum and merger, that they have become like autumn

leaves covering the ground, so much so that the public are unable to distinguish

the  pathways  from  the  drains.  I  have tried  to  listen  patiently  and  as

objectively as I could. As I see it, Sir, there are three sides to the  question

of  blank votes. Firstly, there is the side as it appears to the general public.

Under normal circumstances, a blank vote is a blank piece of paper conveying  no

thing.  Neither for nor against and in democratic practice, Sir, if out  of  100

persons, 39 attend a meeting and 70 choose to be absent, the votes of the 70 are

not counted. The votes of the 30 are the votes that will be counted. I say under

normal  circumstances. The P.A.P. have now presented another  side.  They  claim

that  the  circumstances  are no longer normal, that  in  the  present  abnormal

situation,  the blank votes are loaded votes. That behind these blank  votes  is

another  side,  which  is dynamite, Sir. They have put out  this  propaganda  to

arouse  communal fears, suspicions and illwill. Sir, if what the P.A.P. says  is

true and the situation is abnormal, and there is propaganda going on to make the

blank votes have a twisted meaning, then it is dangerous for the future and  the

welfare  of  the people of Singapore. The P.A.P. claim that Barisan workers  and

supporters are organising a compaign to frighten the people so that  they  will

cast blank votes, not to indicate whether they like this or that form of merger,

but as a protest or out of fear that one community would suffer at the hands  of

another.  Sir,  if the situation is as dangerous and as abnormal as  the  P.A.P.

have painted it out to be, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 697</b></font><br><br>



the  blank votes become loaded votes, then they say they should have the  right,

as  the  Party  in power, to frustrate such a move. That is to say,  if  at  the

traffic crossroads the traffic lights have suddenly jammed, they have the  right

to put on a traffic policeman to enable the traffic to move even against the red

light,  because the traffic lights have jammed. Sir, that is their side  of  the

question  of  blank votes. Sir, the Barisan and pro-Barisan groups maintain  that

this  interpretation of blank votes is undemocratic. It is against common sense.

I  agree that normally it is undemocratic and against common sense. The crux  of

the  matter is: is the situation normal; are the circumstances normal; or is the

situation abnormal, and are the circumstances abnormal? That is the crux of  the

matter.  Sir, in 1946 and 1947, there was a Council of Joint Action  called  the

All-Malaya  Council  of  Joint Action for agitation against  the  Federation  of

Malaya  agreement or Constitution. There was considerable fear in the hearts  of

the Chinese that they would suffer under a government where the Malays would  be

in  the  majority.  Sir, one of the leaders practically went round  the  country

saying we must organise the Chinese to protect their rights and so on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Are all these details relevant to the amendment? Let us

not  go  into details. The fact that there was a Malayan Council of Joint Action

can be mentioned, but only in passing. We do not want these details.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, as to the earlier part of the details, the relevance

is  that  if the loaded votes convey such propaganda, it is a dangerous line.  I

think  it should be said to the credit of some of the leaders that they realised

in  time and, for the sake of the country, they said they would organise  to  co

operate.  That was the salvation for Malaya, Sir. We believe that in this  House

most  of the leaders are responsible people and would like to find an honourable

solution.  So  if there is this deadlock where the question of  blank  votes  is

looked at from three angles and has three different interpretations, let us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 698</b></font><br><br>



take  another look at it in a different way, a constructive way. How can we find

a constructive solution?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all Parties are agreed that there should be merger. They all disagree on

the  forms of merger. To me, Sir, as I have stated here, the different forms  of

merger  or  closer political association are good according to circumstances.  A

small  boy requires a suit of clothes different from the one which the  Minister

for  Health and Law is now wearing. We cannot say the small boy's suit is wrong,

or  that  the Minister's suit is wrong or ill-fitting. So let us put the various

forms of merger to the people and, according to what they like, they choose  the

particular form they want, and let the majority decide on the particular form of

merger or closer association which they think is best for this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have agreed that instead of presenting just one or two choices,

there  will be three. The Member for Cairnhill will later in an amendment  state

the particular alternative we would like to have put before this House and paced

before  the people in the referendum. Sir, since that will be done and  will  he

debated  here, let the different Parties decide on what they think is  the  best

form  of  merger that will be placed before the people. There would then  be  no

question  of blank votes being loaded because the blank votes would  be  just  a

small percentage. And that is what happens in every election. However, Sir, the

blank  votes  come to a big percentage, then perhaps the view which  the  P.A.P.

holds - that the blank votes may be loaded - may be true. But I hope it will not  be

true.  Our  stand is that we want the views of the people on the kind of  merger

they  like  best.  We  do  not want any loaded votes.  We  may  expect  a  small

percentage of blank votes. We surely cannot expect a large percentage  of  blank

votes if all the Parties which stood for election and are represented here  were

accurate  in  their assessment of the wishes of the people. All people  in  this

country  want some form of closer association with the other territories  around

us. Now that we are thinking in terms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 699</b></font><br><br>



of  Malaysia, I, for one, believe that, for the sake of Singapore, we must  have

some  form  of closer association in Malaysia. Even Britain at this  time,  Sir,

finds that it cannot provide prosperity for its people unless it is part of  the

Common  Market. We cannot think in terms of being in a small hole. I would  very

much  like,  if possible, to be in a Singapore that can live by itself,  be  completely

independent and yet be able to provide prosperity and jobs for our  peo

ple  and for our children. If we cannot, then in the interests of the people  of

Singapore,  we  must seek some form of closer association. And I am  sure,  Sir,

with goodwill from all sides, not thinking in terms of party interests and party

supremacy  in  a party struggle, we surely can find some solution that  will  be

good and suitable for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that what we speak here henceforth will help our people outside to

get  a  clearer idea of what the alternatives are. At the moment, as I said,  so

many  things  are  being spoken at such a rapid rate that even  educated  people

outside, when I ask them, say they are confused.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As I have indicated, there seems to be a great deal of repetition. So perhaps we can start winding up.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my speech yesterday I was trying to

explain  the  position  of the Government on the issue of  blank  votes.  In  my

address  I was trying to understand, as far as I can, the objections of the  Member  for Anson to our position. I was not present in this Chamber throughout his

address,  but fortunately we have now a copy of Hansard of his speech yesterday,

from which I can judge his reaction to what I have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I have not gone very far in convincing him of our case. I want to

spend  just  a few minutes to clarify certain issues which, from his statement,

he  is  not very clear about. He said that I was trying to -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Page

number?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 700</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your

pardon, page 48.* He said that I was trying to justify this clause on the ground

that the Communists do not like it, and therefore it must be good. Sir, that has

never  been my justification, and I have never made any statement that can  lend

itself to misinterpretation. He went on to say:

<hr size="2" noshade>

*Vol. 18, No. 5, col. 613.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, he said if the Barisan Sosialis would fight for a merger in accordance

with  the constituent States of the Federation [of Malaya], then he would  agree

that  everybody would have the right to say "yes" or "no", and that there should

not be this nefarious clause [i.e. this clause 29].'



<br><br>Now, I advanced this proposition to show that while the Barisan Sosialis in this

Assembly  stated  that  they  wanted merger as  a  constituent  State  with  the

Federation,  in  all  their propaganda campaigns they have  done  everything  to

undermine  public confidence in any possibility of merger in any form whatsoever

with the Federation. That is my point. And it is because of the Barisan and the

other Communist open front organisations fighting merger at that level that I am

prepared to give this assurance - that if they were to campaign honestly in favour

of merger as a constituent State, in a position of complete equality with any of

the  eleven States, then I say this clause is quite unnecessary. But because  we

know  that  they  have been campaigning quite contrary to their openly  declared

stand in this Assembly, I say that it is this which is at the root of dishonesty

in the referendum. Therefore, special precautions have to be taken to counteract

the effect of the Barisan's dishonesty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member far Anson is not satisfied. He says, "Why pay so much attention to

the Barisan?" He says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Are we running this country for the Barisan Sosialis?'

<br><br>The answer is, of course, "No." But if Barisan Sosialis are up to mischief, then

I  say it is the duty of the Government to prevent this mischief from having any

dangerous effect in the country. If it is only a matter of the Member for  Anson

who is trying to create mischief, with due respect to the Member, Sir, I say  we

will not be greatly alarmed. Because





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 701</b></font><br><br>



without  the  organisational support of the Communist open front  organisations,

the  Member  for  Anson would be a completely spent force. Then he  raised  this

question of how the merger proposals

should be framed at the referendum. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I cannot see how it can matter whether the Barisan Sosialis are or are not in

favour of merger on the basis of a constituent State.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can these words be spoken, Mr Speaker, Sir? It does matter a great deal,

because  if  they are in favour of complete merger on an equal  basis  with  any

other  State, and they publicly stated so, we have quoted innumerable  documents

and  I  do not want to repeat these quotations. Then they are committed to  this

line,  and if they choose in their ground level campaign to do just the reverse,

then  they  cannot  blame us if we take precautions in this Referendum  Bill  to

neutralise the effect of their mischievous dishonesty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson then goes on to complain that putting complete merger in

the  way  that  we  intend, that is to say, to state it as  complete  and  unconditional  merger  on  the  basis of equality with  any  of  the  States  of  the

Federation, that is not a fair way of putting it because, in his own words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The trouble about a constituent State, Sir, is that the P.A.P. themselves

have  so  sullied  and  distorted that, though it may  at  one  time  have  been

acceptable by virtue of the interpretation which the P.A.P. have put, it is  one

which they know nobody can accept.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, I take it that the Member for Anson means that complete and unconditional merger on terms equal with those of any other State in the Federation

would  lead  automatically  to conversion of Singapore  citizens  to  Federation

citizens. I think that is his line. And he said that we have disputed this interpretation,  and that our feeling is that if we accept complete merger  on  equal

terms with other States, the citizenship laws of the Federation would apply  and

large  numbers  of  Singapore citizens who were not born  here  may  lose  their

citizenship. That is our view. The Member for Anson says that that  is  a  wrong

legal interpretation and that, in fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 702</b></font><br><br>



under  complete  merger  he  is quite confident that  Singapore  citizens  would

automatically qualify for full Federal citizenship. Now, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If I might, Sir, rise on a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you. I am grateful to the Minister. The Minister has

correctly  interpreted  me, except the last portion. I mentioned  nothing  about

legal interpretation. I said that all Parties when they spoke of complete merger

understood, and so do the people of Singapore, that by complete merger we  meant

the  integration of our territory in the Federation and that our citizens  would

be  Federal citizens. That is my position as to the understanding of the  phrase

"complete and unconditional merger".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is my point. Now, I do not want to get too much

involved  in this issue in this debate because I think we are debating a  motion

to  be raised by him. I only want to say that that is his interpretation of  the

legal consequences of complete merger. And I say-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Not legal.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member



says "not legal".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Well then, Sir,

I  have got it completely wrong, because if it is not a legal consequence of complete  equality with any of the other eleven States, then he is, in fact, asking

for more favourable treatment for Singapore than any of the other eleven States.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Probably that

illustrates  why we should wait until we debate the questions to be  posed,  and

then  all this matter can be cleared. As I say, I am trying to direct the debate

to winding up now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, Sir. Now,

the  question which will be put in the referendum; the Government is not putting

up  its own interpretation of the consequences of complete merger, its effect on

the citizens. The Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 703</b></font><br><br>

Anson  on previous occasions said that we would put the question something  like

this:  complete  merger like Penang or Malacca in which half  of  the  citizens

would  be disfranchised. We are not putting up that sort of a question, and  if

we  did  put up that sort of question, I agree that that would be dishonest  because  it  is putting forward our point of view of what complete merger  means.

In  the  question which we shall put - the alternative to complete merger - we  are

making  no such interpretation. And it will be quite wrong for us to  say  that

complete merger would mean automatic conversion, because in the event  that  is

not  possible, then  I  would say we would have been guilty  of  cheating  the

citizens,  promising them something which in the event cannot be fulfilled.  In

fact,  we know right from now it cannot be fulfilled, although of course I  see

that the Member for Queenstown -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the

Minister now is exciting a debate on that. He has said enough to clear  what  he

says is a misunderstanding by the Member for Anson of what he said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I was just about to refer to this famous Article 22 of the

Federation  Constitution.  If you think that that  would  be  going  beyond  the

debate, then I would not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to bring together my arguments in a few sentences. We say that in this

referendum, two or three honest alternatives will be put to the electorate. They

are  honest because these alternatives are capable of realisation if the  people

want  to  accept them. They are honest because the point of basic principles  is

that all Parties in this Assembly want and have put forward one form or other of

these three proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everybody concerned in this referendum were - to use a British colloquialism - to play cricket, the Barisan say they want complete merger like any one

of  the  eleven States (Penang, perhaps Malacca); the U.P.P., like  Johore;  the

Workers' Party unconditional; and they all persuade the electorate to cast their

votes against their choice, then obviously the percentage of blank votes will be

very small, no more than in any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 704</b></font><br><br>



general election. Now, Sir, we know that this is not going to happen, and it  is

not going to happen because the Barisan Sosialis have no intention whatsoever to

honour their undertaking which they have given in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Just to wind up, Dr Lee.

<br><br>4.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to answer. Sir, some of the malicious arguments

put  forward by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance. The P.A.P. have

always harped on first principles and that on this particular question of merger

they have a mandate from the people. I think we have debunked this claim on many

occasions,  but  they  still come up with the same so-called  mandate  from  the

people. They never had this mandate from the people about merger, Sir, as I have

on many occasions explained. If a person asks for food, it does not mean that he

will  accept arsenic, caustic soda or sulphuric acid maybe that is served up  to

him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we have heard that analogy too often. Let us now

wind  up  the debate. It is a question of I say this, you say this;  and  I  say

this, you say this, so far. Well, then let us wind up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand, Sir, but the Prime Minister chose to repeat

the same falsehoods and therefore I have to rebut him again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excuse given by the Government Ministers for the blank votes has always

been that it is to prevent the mounting

a  campaign  by the Communists and pro-Communists to defeat the referendum  and

to wreck merger. What does he mean by mischief? He says if the Barisan Sosialis

were to give up this so-called mischief, then they would be prepared to withdraw

their  blank  vote  clause.  What  mischief  are  they  talking  about?  Is   it

mischievous, Sir, to stand up to fight for the right of the common man?  Is  it

mischievous to fight for democracy, equality, justice? Is that mischievous, Sir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 705</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every self-respecting man when faced with two unacceptable alternatives will

probably put in a blank paper, and it is because the P.A.P. themselves know this

reaction that they have, through their ingenuity, put in this blank paper clause

as  a trap so that they may be able to get for the P.A.P. votes which do not support  the P.A.P. do not think I need touch on this plot any more; it is  common

talk in the town now, and everybody knows that it is because the P.A.P. dare not

pose  their own merger proposals to the people in a one-question referendum that

they  have decided to pose two questions to the people. And to ensure  that  the

loophole  of  blank votes is closed the blank votes cast will he  taken  by  the

P.A.P. under the special clause on blank papers. Their excuse, Sir, can easily-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir, If the Member for Queenstown is not

ready to wind up his thoughts, I suggest we adjourn for five minutes to give him

time  to put his thoughts together. We can then put the questions, because  much

as we all like to keep order, it is very difficult to do so when snatches of old

refrains come back again and again. The tedium is almost inhuman to bear.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have often asked

Members to avoid repetition. Winding up does not mean to say you have to  repeat

your arguments in detail. I will ask the Member now to wind up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I know, Sir, he feels very sore when anyone touches on that

clause  of  theirs, but I have to mention this again because they keep repeating

the same falsehood. If they had not, I would not have touched on it again. It is

as  simple  as  that. Just because they have the radio and Rediffusion  to  help

them, and just because of their clamp on the Press - two-thirds space to the Government and only one-third space to the Opposition Members - so they think that by

repeating  the same falsehoods long and loud enough, some people might  come  to

believe  what they say. But I will just give one analogy, Sir, of their specious

arguments-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 706</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A new one?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> A new one. It is like this: The P.A.P. want to rob somebody. They rob that person and give an excuse for their robbery that another

person might want to rob that person.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Inhuman!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister

for  Finance  excited a retort by his speech which was bordering on irrelevancy.

Perhaps  he  could  now contain himself. The Member will finish  in  about  five

minutes, I believe. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, the Government Benches do not like this

debate  anyway.  If  they could help it, there would not be  a  debate  on  this

Referendum  Bill at all. They try to guillotine our debate, and I can  see  that

they  further  want to guillotine other debates. I have already brought  up  one

point about this guillotine of theirs-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We have

passed the guillotine motion. Let us deal with the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, there has been a lot of talk of their being democratic

because  they are posing two honest alternatives to the people. I know  we  will

debate  this in detail when we come to debate the questions to be posed  by  the

Government  in the referendum. But at least at this point let me indicate  their

absolute  dishonesty  in  the posing of these two questions.  The  Minister  for

Finance says they are honest because they are supposed to be the merger stand of

the  Opposition. The point is: Are they really posing the merger  stand  of  the

Opposition?  If  they  are  not,  then it is  clear  that  those  questions  are

dishonest.  If  they want to pose the merger stand of the Opposition,  the  only

honest  thing  for the Government to do is to let the Opposition  explain  their

stand  and  to  pose it themselves. The Government have no right  to  put  their

malicious and distorted interpretation on our merger stand. Day in and  day  out

they have repeated these malicious falsehoods. It is time that we in this august

Assembly put a stop to their malicious falsehoods. Our stand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 707</b></font><br><br>



has  always  been that if there should be merger, then there must  be  automatic

Federal  citizenship  for  Singapore citizens together with  proportional  representation  in  the Central Parliament. On this we have already  repeatedly  said

there  can be no compromise and no retreat, and if the P.A.P. were honest,  then

they  would  put  our  stand as enunciated by us on the question  paper  in  the

referendum.

<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 29. Does the

Member for Anson wish to move simpliciter?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If you will permit me, Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 16, to leave out from "who" to the end of line 18, and

insert "is not in favour of any of the proposals posed by the referendum or  has

not understood the questions or the instructions for voting".



<br><br>So that the sub-clause will now read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any person whose ballot paper

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is unmarked; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) is uncertain

<br><br>shall  be  deemed  to be a person who is not in favour of any of  the  proposals

posed  by the referendum or has not understood the questions or the instructions

for voting.'

<br><br>I  merely want to point out this, Mr Speaker, that though the first part  seems

to  suggest  that it should be treated as a negative, nevertheless  the  second

limb  of  it makes it clear that I want the papers which are unmarked  and  the

ballot  papers which are uncertain to be treated as void, unlike the subsequent

one -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I

cannot  permit any further debate on that, because if the Member  for  Anson  is

allowed  to make a statement, then, of course, it will excite a debate.  I  have

indicated  that the motion should be moved simpliciter, and it has  been  moved

not  quite  simpliciter. The Member for Anson seeks to leave out the words  from

"who"  in line 16 to the end of line 18, and by the second amendment, the Member

for  Hong Lim seeks only to leave out part of those words - that is, to leave  out

"accepts  or is willing". Under Standing Order No. 39, paragraph (4)  therefore,

the  first  question on the amendment of the Member for Anson is that the  words

from "willing" in line 16 to the end of line 18 be left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee resumed.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29-(contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 29 - amendment (iii) in the name of the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 19, after "be", to insert "counted and shall be separately".



<br><br>Amendment (iv) in the name of the Member for Hong Lim,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 19, to leave out "included' and insert "announced".



<br><br>I  might  remind hon. Members that much has been said on the principle of  these

two  amendments  when we discussed the amendments to clause 27  and  clause  30.

Perhaps they will try to avoid repetitions as far as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A12, line 19, after "be", to insert "counted and shall be separately".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the sub-clause will now read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number of such ballot papers shall be counted and shall be separately

included  by  the  Superintendent  in his  declaration  of  the  result  of  the

referendum."

<br><br>I  am indeed happy to find myself, Sir, on this occasion supported - in principle,

though  not  in  exact  words - by the Member for Hong Lim. The  purpose  of  this

amendment is at least to

enable the people to know the extent of perfidy which is perpetrated on them. We

ask  no  more than what is normally granted in every election that blank  papers

and  ambiguous  ballot  papers, which are now to be counted  as  votes  for  the

Government,  should be counted and the number of such votes  shall  be  declared

publicly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I give you the position where a hundred people go to vote:

to  vote  for  the P.A.P. proposals; one votes for Penang and Malacca,  and  89

cast blank votes. The Government will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 713</b></font><br><br>



tell  you  they have got 99, but they will not tell you 10 plus 89.  The  Government's declaration will be through their Superintendent, "We have 99 per cent of

the vote."



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask that that vote be broken down into its realities and that it should be

clearly  indicated. Which are the votes for the P.A.P. proposals, and which  are

the  protest  blank  votes which, by a dishonest provision that  all  men  shall

henceforth he known as women, the Government now transforms into votes  for  the

P.A.P. proposals? That is all. This provision seeks that the people shall  know

the  truth.  It  cannot  legally affect the dishonesty  that  is  sought  to  be

perpetrated. It merely asks that the dishonesty or lack of it should be  clearly

proclaimed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to notice that there is at least one Member of the Opposition

Front  bench  here  to  hear this part of what I have  to  say.  In  the  Select

Committee  on  the same principle, in column 395 the Member for Cairnhill  voted

with  the  Opposition  group. The principle there was on the  principle  of  the

announcement  to be made by the Superintendent wherein the main issue  was  that

the  number  of  blank  and  ambiguous votes should be  clearly  and  separately

indicated. Sir, the P.A.P. are seeking, like a dog hiding his dirt, to hide  the

truth  of the results of the referendum and if that is what they seek, Sir,  why

do  they not ask for an overall clause whereby they can say that the P.A.P. may

at  the  end of a referendum announce that the P.A.P. proposals have obtained  a

100  per cent vote? It is just as honest. What are they ashamed of? Oh, yes.  We

do  not want to give, they say, any value to these votes. But you are not giving

any  value  to  them, Sir. By declaring them separately you are not  giving  any

legal  value to them. The P.A.P. would be merely displaying the extent of  their

dishonesty.  And  if  that  is the value they are  afraid  to  disclose,  I  can

understand.

All this amendment seeks is that the number of blank and ambiguous votes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 714</b></font><br><br>



would  be clearly declared in the result of the referendum, a position  which  I

repeat was supported by the Singapore People's Alliance in the Select Committee.

It is my hope that they will continue to support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

propose to play the same old record again and again like the Member for Anson. I

just  want to break the monotony. Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said when we  were

discussing the Schedule a few days ago, this provision is not necessary. It  has

already been provided in clause 29 (1) that unmarked or uncertain votes will  be

regarded, as far as the voters are concerned, as willing to accept the  decision

of  the Assembly. So there is no need to have this separate counting. The voters

know  that  if they cast a blank vote it will be treated in the way as  provided

for  in  clause 29. There is nothing secret. There is nothing dishonest.  It  is

public knowledge. I just do not see the point made by the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister for Home Affairs says it is not necessary and he has prided himself

on the fact that this Bill is based on the best of parliamentary systems. Let us

ask  the  Ministers and the Prime Minister which government, which parliamentary

system and which country says that the detailed results of the voting should not

he announced to the

public.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I trust the Member for Queenstown will not repeat his

argument which he made when he moved his amendments to clause 27 and clause  30.

We are now dealing with a specific request that numbers of specific votes should

be declared to the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, my argument has direct relevance to this

amendment.  Of course, the Government would not like to announce the  result  of

the  voting to the people because there is a plot to turn all these blank  votes

into  Government votes. And in turning these blank votes into Government  votes,

they are at the same time afraid of letting the people know the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 715</b></font><br><br>



extent  of their dishonesty. It is for this particular reason that they  do

not  want  to  announce the result of the voting. If  the  Government  were

honest,  there  should  be no reason why the true  results  should  not  be

presented to the people.

The people have a right to know the

true position in the voting. It is the duty of the Government to place  all

the facts before the people.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Member for Anson has said that I voted with the Opposition in  the

Select  Committee.  I  would  like to make my stand  clear.  The  Singapore

People's  Alliance  voted independently and because the  other  Parties  in

opposition happened to vote with the Singapore People's Alliance,  that  is

just  the misfortune of the Singapore People's Alliance. Sir, we took  that

line  because  it  was related to the two previous clauses  that  had  been

disposed  of.  The fact that the questions will be fully  debated  in  this

Assembly  has  removed the objection that we have. As I have said,  because

clause  29 that has just received the approval of this Assembly is intended

by  the Government in its game of make-believe with the Communists, we will

have  nothing to do with it. If the Member for Anson is going to claim that

because  I voted no, and because they voted no, therefore, we were fighting

shoulder  to  shoulder, it would make me feel that perhaps over  the  amendment  that had just been disposed of, we were fighting shoulder to shoulder

on an abstention, although I had been cleared. It has been charged that an

abstention is a vote to keep the Government alive; that we are all keen to  keep

the Government alive over the abstention during the last clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill knows well that

the  difficulty with the last clause was that it sought to make  the  blank

ballot  papers - and with some validity - to count as negative votes.  In  the

particular  context  of  the proposed referendum, I  can  see  very  strong

reasons  in support, but I was so much averse to any suggestion  that  what

is  blank  should  count as anything at all. Lawfully that - quite  naturally

you can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 716</b></font><br><br>



understand, Mr Speaker - I abstained in that context.

It  was not a question of supporting the Government, and he knows well it was  a

question  of  not supporting a principle with which I found myself at  variance.

But  he  has not dealt with the issue here. All we are seeking is that the  dirt

should  be  identified. There must he a distinction surely  to  the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  if  not  to the Members of the Government Front bench,  between  the

votes specifically cast for the P.A.P. proposals and a blank ballot paper which,

by  this  clause which turns a man into a woman, is deemed to be a vote for  the

P.A.P. proposals. Does the Member for Cairnhill see no distinction between those

two? Does he not think that it is fair that we should have separately -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> gestured.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If the Minister for Home Affairs has anything to contribute, I

will gladly sit down on a point of elucidation or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am asking and I would ask it again, since it seems to hurt him: Is

there  no  distinction  between a vote cast for the P.A.P. proposals?  Honestly

cast? And a vote cast in disgust - blank

- and  which by law - a P.A.P. law -  we are now transforming into a P.A.P. vote,

into  a vote for the P.A.P. proposals. Have the people no right to know how many

really  wanted the P.A.P. proposals and how many were deemed to want the  P.A.P.

proposals?  That is all it seeks. It is not necessarily no. Nothing  is  hidden,

says the Minister for Home Affairs. Language has no meaning, Mr Speaker, to the

Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> We do not speak the same language.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He interrupts again, Mr Speaker, to tell me we do not speak the

same  language. I do not speak the dishonest language of a dishonest Party  and

dishonest  Ministers,  because  these  dishonest  Ministers  [Interruption]-

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> What nonsense!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Anson should try to contain himself. He

has  answered,  and  if  he answers in a calm manner, he will  not  get  further

interjections.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b>

Why are you angry?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am asked, Mr

Speaker, why I am angry - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I will tell the hon. Lady, if I may through you, Mr

Speaker,  of  the  Back-benches. Can she not understand the natural  anger  that

rises at the spectacle of a group that has been fully trusted by the people at a

general election - trusted and now this trust, this power which has been entrusted - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We have the spectacle of these people standing up with poised

daggers  at  the  back  of those who trusted them. Can she not  understand  that

anger?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Poised daggers of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> So, Mr Speaker, the Minister for Home Affairs says there is

nothing  hidden.  Now,  this curious vocabulary of his. What  does  he  mean  by

hidden,  Sir?  As we understand the English language, "hidden" is  to  cover  up

something like a dog covers up his dirt.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have been listening to very lurid language, very

extravagant phrases and very offensive phrases. I have not been able to pull  up

the  Member  for  Anson  simply  because those  phrases  were  not  directed  at

individual Members. But I think in order to save the decorum of this Assembly  I

should try now, henceforth, to stop phrases which in themselves are offensive.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May it please you, Mr

Speaker. And I am only unhappy that you cannot stop action which is offensive to

the people-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 718</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I will not have any debate about my rulings. If the

Member is unhappy about the ruling he can put down a substantive motion. He must

accept the ruling, no matter how much he dislikes it.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not dislike it. I will be very happy to comply

with  it. And I was being quite honest when I said I was unhappy that you  could

not  as  easily prevent distasteful conduct by the Government towards the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to this 'hidden'. Mr Speaker, Sir, if we permit the publication separately of the numbers who vote for the P.A.P. proposals and the

numbers  who  cast  blank votes, we would know in truth who generally  want  the

P.A.P. proposals and those who by law

- this  curious,  dishonest  law which contravenes all concepts  of  decency - are

deemed  to  have voted for the P.A.P. proposals, in refusing this provision,  is

the  Government not requiring that the fact should be hidden as to who voted for

the White Paper and who was deemed to vote for the White Paper? In announcing in

one  single  figure the total of those in favour of Command  Paper  33,  is  the

Government  not, in fact, hiding the number of blank and ambiguous  votes  which

went to that total? What language does the Minister for Home Affairs talk?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was going to indicate that this debate could range over

the amendment to be moved by the Member for Hong Lim because the principle seems

to  be the same. So that when we complete this debate, the Member for Hong  Lim,

if he so desires, could move his amendment simpliciter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I accept your ruling, Sir. Under clause 29 (1) all blank

votes  could  be  considered as pro-Government votes. As I  said  in  my  speech

yesterday, our stand is that these votes are not pro-Government votes. They  are

neither void votes nor neutral votes. They are anti-Government votes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 719</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  it  is  important, for the purpose of the record  in  history,  even

though  the  Government's  so-called merger is being pushed  down  the  people's

throats,  that  the  number of anti-Government votes be separately  counted  and

announced, so that the people could know how many are really for the White Paper

proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the present clause, all those votes which are anti-Government would, I understand, be put in the same basket as pro-Government

votes.  The Government has now lost all sense of shame and decency. It has  even

dared  come  out  with the result of the blank votes. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it  is

important  for the future that we in Singapore should know the number  of  blank

votes  which  have  been  cast,  or which will be  cast  in  the  coming  merger

referendum.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not like this but we can understand

the motive which has impelled the Government to want to have this. We cannot  be

a  party  to it but we do not want to put the Government into greater difficulty

than  the  difficulty which they are already facing. The Member  for  Anson  has

asked  why  these votes should not be disclosed. I feel that he has answered  it

himself  when he employs the allegory that these blank votes being used  by  the

Government is like turning a man into a woman, and the P.A.P., having  turned  a

man  into a woman, is therefore anxious to hide the woman from the gaze  of  the

lecherous eyes of those who mean ill to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, from the

speech by the Member for Cairnhill, I feel very surprised that all his words are

conflicting. The Member for Cairnhill, every time he speaks, claims  himself  to

be  acting in and not contrary to the interests of the people. However, he knows

too  that the statement that these blank votes are pro-Government votes  is  not

correct  and  is  undemocratic. Now that he knows that  these  blank  votes  are

undemocratic,  how come he supports the Government's proposals?  Therefore,  the

amendment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 720</b></font><br><br>



of  the Opposition demands that the Superintendent must announce separately  the

result of the referendum - how many blank votes and how many votes are void.  The

Member  for Cairnhill knows the attitude and behaviour of the Government.  Then

it is just like a thief who stole something from other people. If the Government

is a responsible Government, then it has the responsibility to protect the basic

rights  of  the  people.  The Member for Cairnhill evidently  knows  that  this

provision  is undemocratic; yet, according to him, the Government can  pass  any

law to turn a woman into a man. He contends:

how can you expect the Government to announce the result of the referendum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the demand of the Member for Anson is very reasonable. The

money  to be spent on the referendum is equivalent to the amount of money  spent

in  a general election. In the forthcoming referendum the Government is going to

spend  about  $400,000  of  the public money. During the  general  election  the

Returning  Officer  has  the  right to announce the  figures  of  every  polling

district.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is an argument which was advanced when we were

discussing the amendments to clause 27 and clause 30. The Member should  not  be

confused. We are now on a specific request that the votes which are unmarked and

uncertain be counted and be separately announced. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to point out to you that it is much easier for the

Government to announce the counting of these uncertain votes and void votes than

the  votes  cast  during  a general election. Therefore,  I  maintain  that  the

Government has no reason to reject this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, just more than an hour ago the Government has stream-rollered

through  a  provision in this Bill to steal and dishonestly retain the  unmarked

and  spoilt  votes  in this referendum. Now they seek to hide their  dishonestly

acquired votes from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 721</b></font><br><br>



people  by  refusing  to  accede to the amendment of the  Member  for  Anson  to

classify  and  announce the votes they have so dishonestly stolen separately.  I

was  just  looking through the Select Committee Report No. 6 of Wednesday,  16th

May,  1962. In column 391, three paragraphs from the bottom, you, Mr  Chairman,

Sir,  indicated that the amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown to  clause

27,  and  the amendment to be moved by the Member for Anson to clause  29,  were

almost the same thing. In column 392, fourth paragraph, you said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So that the amendment would be "Such statement shall he as near as may be in

the Form in the Schedule to this Ordinance."'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There again I think the Member for Nee Soon is going back

to  the  debate which has been dealt with in regard to the amendment  which  was

moved  in clause 27 and the related amendment to be moved in clause 30.  We  are

now  on  a  specific request and I think the Member must in his  speech  confine

himself to that specific request.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will just bear with me, I have

mentioned  this  in  order  to  come to my point:  my  point  being,  Sir,  that

subsequent  to  your  comments,  the Minister for  Home  Affairs  said,  in  the

paragraph just below Mr David Marshall:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, I personally think it is impossible [that is, to have such

a  Schedule to the Ordinance]. In fact, I consulted my officials on this  matter

and  they  advised  against  it, because no one  can  anticipate  what  type  of

referendum or what kind of question will be posed in future...'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sorry. I must interrupt the Member for Nee Soon.

He is going right back again to an old

issue.  If he has any passage in Hansard which makes specific reference to  this

matter, then he can quote it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> If you will bear with me for one more moment, Sir, I will

come to the point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 722</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I suggest that the Member for Nee Soon comes to the

point first and then he can indicate how what he says is relevant or not.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Sir. Yesterday we received two amendments from

the  Government: one by the Minister for Home Affairs which seeks to revoke this

Bill  after  merger; another by the Prime Minister which seeks to pose  the  two

questions  to be posed in the referendum for debate in this House. My  argument,

Sir,  is  that the notice papers given by the Minister for Home Affairs and  the

Prime Minister invalidate what the Minister for Home Affairs said here. He  said

that since it was impossible to anticipate what type of questions would be posed

and that since this was a general Referendum Bill -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have invited the hon. Member to come to his point which

must be a point relevant to the amendment. Then he can indicate how what he says

is relevant. I do not know what his point is. Let us come to the point first.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is in the light of these two

amendments by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs respectively,

the  argument by the Minister for Home Affairs in Select Committee  cannot  hold

water any more.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. But that argument does not arise on this particular

amendment.  I  cannot see how it arises on this particular amendment.  It  arose

when  the Member for Queenstown sought a Schedule. But, as I say, that has  been

disposed of.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  just before I started quoting this particular part of Hansard, I did  make

mention  that you yourself, Sir, have stated in column 391 the relation  between

the  amendment  to clause 29 and the amendment to clause 27 and  that  you  have

indicated that what is proposed in clause 27 could well be taken when it came to

clause  29. So, in the light of these two amendments, it is my submission,  Sir,

that the arguments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 723</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Minister  for Home Affairs and also subsequently of  the  Minister  for

Finance that this is a general Referendum Bill cannot hold water.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that

the hon. Member is persisting in irrelevance. I have to do that before I can ask

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my contention that even if the

votes  as  their  votes, they have no ground whatsoever to hide  the  number  of

abstaining votes from the people. It is therefore my contention, Sir,  that  the

amendment  moved by the Member for Anson should be respected by  the  Government

and that they should agree with it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I move respectively the amendments*

standing in my name. I see that the Member for Anson is also moving

substantially the same amendments+, and I will leave the detailed arguments to

him. For my part, we move the amendments for very simple reasons. We feel that

the penalty is too severe. It is our contention that even if you want to

penalise anybody, penalise him once but not twice. Sir, our fear is that

immediately after a referendum, or not so very long after, a general election

may be held. At any rate, the life of the Government does -



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The following amendments stood in the name of Dr Lee Siew Choh:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (i) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, line 36, after "years", to insert "or a fine".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (ii) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, line 38, to leave out "of seven" and insert "not exceeding

three".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+The following amendments stood in the name of Mr David Marshall:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (iv) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, to leave out lines 37 to 44 inclusive and insert "or a fine,

and  may by such conviction be declared incapable, for a period of up to seven

years  from  the date of his conviction, of being registered as an elector  or

of  voting at any referendum under this Ordinance or of voting at any election

under the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (vi) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A14, line 6, to leave out from "year" to the end of line 14 and

insert "or a fine".

<br><br>I  wonder whether the Member for Queenstown would concentrate on that amendment,

dispose  of that, and then come to the other amendments, unless it is convenient

to deal with all the amendments together if they are related.

convenient.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Then we will do it

this  way. The debate will range over amendments (i)*, (ii)* and (iii).  I  will

not  say the whole of amendment (iv)+, because I think that amendment is  really

in  two  parts. So I will then allow the debate to range over amendments  (ii)*

and (iii)*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The following amendments stood in the name of Dr Lee Siew Choh:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (i) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, line 36, after "years", to insert "or a fine".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (iii) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, line 38, to leave out "of seven" and insert "not exceeding

three".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+The following amendments stood in the name of Mr David Marshall:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (iv) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, to leave out lines 37 to 44 inclusive and insert "or a fine,

and  may by such conviction be declared incapable, for a period of up to seven

years  from  the date of his conviction, of being registered as an elector  or

of  voting at any referendum under this Ordinance or of voting at any election

under the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance".

insert "or a fine".

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, our arguments are very simple. As I said, the life

of  the Government will not extend beyond 1964 anyway. It may topple much sooner

than  that  since they are no more a majority in the House. If  the  penalty  is

fixed,  then  it will mean seven years' imprisonment - a seven years' penalty.  If

allowed, it will mean penalising a person twice as regards his voting rights, as

there will be 2 general elections in 7 years from today. That is the reason  for

our  amendments. Sir. A person should only be penalised once. The other part  of

our  amendment is that we feel that discretion should be left to  a  High  Court

Judge  to decide whether or not a less heavy penalty should be inflicted on  the

person.  We  feel  that the option of a fine should be allowed.  The  period  of

penalty  should  not  exceed  three  years, because  there  may  be  extenuating

circumstances and only a Judge will be able to decide.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been moved as an amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, line 36, after "years", to insert "or a fine".



<br><br>The  Question  is, "That the words proposed to be inserted, be there  inserted."

The debate may range over the second amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, lines 37 and 38, to leave out "shall, by such conviction, become

incapable,  for  a period of" and insert "may, on such conviction,  be  declared

incapable for a period of up to".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, line 38, to leave out "of seven" and insert "not exceeding three"



<br><br>It seems to me that the Member for Queenstown wants two bites at the cherry. If

his amendment (ii) fails, he would like amendment (iii)



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise before the Government Benches reply, because

I  would like to clarify certain aspects. You will notice, in spirit though  not

in wording, the Member for Queenstown and I on this matter are rather close.  I

do  not seek to reduce the maximum penalty to three years as he does, because  I

seek to highlight the discretionary power of our courts. Mr Chairman, before  I

come  to that, I would ask you to look at this rag-bag of clause 32 (1). It  has

nine assorted classifications of crimes, some of them very serious, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 728</b></font><br><br>



and some of them far from serious. For example, forges or counterfeits ballot papers  in  paragraph (a), I think you will agree, Sir, is a very serious  matter.

And the last paragraph (i):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'manufactures, constructs, imports . . . supplies . . ., or causes to be manufactured... any appliance, device or mechanism by which a

ballot paper may be extracted...'



<br><br>which are very serious offences indeed.

<br><br>Then, Sir,

paragraph (e):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'puts into any ballot box anything other than the ballot paper...'.

<br><br>If he puts in a pencil, he gets seven years' imprisonment. He is deprived of his voting right for seven years. If he is an Assemblyman, he must immediately get out

of  the Assembly. The next one, Sir, paragraph (f) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'without due authority...takes out of any polling station any ballot paper... '

<br><br>Now that is very particularly

pertinent,  Sir, because it does not require what in law is known as  mens  rea,

the word is not "intentionally" takes out, Sir, but:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'without due authority...takes out...any ballot paper or is found in possession of any ballot paper'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you will ask why I have not

sought to amend it. I can understand the Government on this, Sir. This, as they

will tell you, is copied from the 1954 Elections Ordinance which they tried to

father on to me, Sir, but they discovered later that their history on this was

somewhat rusty and that this was, in fact, a colonial

provision-[Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister for Law is getting

disorderly. He will have his opportunity of answering. Mr Marshall.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, they will tell you this comes from the 1954 Legislative Assembly

Elections Ordinance. I repeat I am very unhappy about this provision, without

due authority, but if you leave it to a Judge, Sir, and if he sees, for example,

here is an ignorant woman. If she goes in she is supposed to put her paper into

the box. She walks out with the paper, not intending anything wrong. You can

leave it to the good sense of the Judge to deal with her in accordance with the

provisions of the law, exercising his discretion whether to put a heavy sentence

or a light one. Unfortunately,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 729</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  in this rag-bag they have nine classifications of offences. They go  right

out of the normal tradition which has been found to be so valuable, of providing

a maximum punishment and leaving it to a Judge to exercise his discretion within

that maximum what sentence to impose. Sir, that is the entire basis of the amend

ments  as  I understand them, amendments (i) and (ii), and certainly  the  first

part  of  my  amendment  in  (iv). All I seek is to  leave  the  matter  to  the

discretion

of a Judge. I recognize that these offences, some of which are very grave should

be  severely  punished,  just as you severely punish  attempted  murder  or  you

severely punish voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon, where

you  put  the sentence up to ten years: but within that maximum, Sir, the  Judge

has  a discretion in particular cases even to impose a fine or to impose a  life

sentence,  depending upon the circumstances which brought about the offence  and

the motive behind it. The trust we have in our Judges has been not merely richly

deserved  but has worked magnificently. We must all confess that no  Legislature

could have succeeded so well in imposing tables of sentences as have been worked

out  in experience by providing a maximum and letting the Judges exercise  their

discretion. If the man is a second offender, if the man is a third offender,  if

the  man is a confirmed criminal, they can then exercise their discretion within

that  maximum. I want to repeat, Sir, because here again I quite naturally  fear

distortion. I am not seeking to support the third amendment. All I am seeking is

that there should be a discretion vested in the Judge to provide for a fine,  to

provide  for imprisonment up to seven years if he thinks proper, as well  as  to

provide  for  declaring him to be incapable of voting or standing for  election.

May  I seek your guidance, Mr Chairman, as regards the second aspect, which  is

technical, to leave that when we come to amendment (iv)?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it the Member for Anson is raising a legal argument in

regard to the last part of clause 32, that is, he seeks to leave out the words:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'or of being elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and if at that date

he  is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his seat shall be vacated from  the

date of such conviction'.

<br><br>The  argument on that will be a legal argument. Is it convenient to the Minister

to leave that until later for argument?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, Sir, the offences mentioned in this clause

are  very  serious and if we wish to keep the referendum clean, it is  essential

that  the  punishment should provide a deterrent. These are  offences  connected

with  electoral  procedures. It is right and proper, in view of the  gravity  of

these  offences,  that the court should not be given a discretion  to  impose  a

fine. In the framing of legislation, Sir, it is the practice for the Legislature

to  distinguish  between offences which are grave, offences  which  are  not  so

grave,  and  offences which are minor. In the case of offences which  are  minor

offences, it is the practice to provide that the court can only punish by way of

a  fine.  In the case of offences which are not so grave, the court is  given  a

discretion to impose punishment by way of imprisonment or a fine. In cases which

are considered to be grave, it is usual to provide that the court can punish  by

way  of  imprisonment only or imprisonment and a fine. In the case to which  the

Member for Anson referred just now, paragraph (e) of clause 32 (1) he cited  the

case  of  somebody putting a pencil into the ballot box. He failed to  read  on.

There is sub-clause (6) which provides that prosecutions for offences under this

section  shall  not  be instituted without the sanction of the  State  Advocate-General. In matters like that, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we could leave it to the good sense of the State Advocate-General

not  to  institute any proceedings. It will be the same with regard to  offences

under paragraph (f) of this sub-clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the court having a discretion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I see from the text of

this  clause that the court is already vested with the discretion as far as  the

period  of imprisonment is concerned. Because these offences are grave  offences

and  they  cannot be considered minor, it is essential that the only  punishment

that  should  be provided for a breach of any of these provisions  should  be  a

sentence of imprisonment, Sir.

<br><br>7.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I am

indebted.  In fact, the Minister is correct, and I apologise for the  oversight.

It is correct, Sir, that there is a discretion there "for a term not exceeding...".

There  is  a  discretion in the Court indicated by the Minister,  but  it  is  a

question of refusing to permit a fine, Sir, It is very unusual because he  wants

the discretion to be vested in the State Advocate-General-and it is so vested - as

to  whether  he  should  institute proceedings or not.  Why  not,  Sir,  have  a

discretion  also  in  the  Court, which is surely, from  experience,  even  more

responsible  than the State Advocate-General and which can be left in  its  good

sense  to decide whether the circumstances require a fine? I would not  urge  it

further than that, Sir, I do not know how, I must confess, I had tripped up here

in thinking it was compulsory.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (iii).



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I move amendment (iii) simpliciter, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, line 38, to leave out "of seven" and insert "exceeding three".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That disposes of the first part of amendment (iv). The remaining

part is really, in effect, an amendment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from "Ordinance" in line 41 to the end of line 44 [that is to

say,  the words] "or of being elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly,  and

if  at  that date he is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his seat shall  be

vacated from the date of such conviction".



<br><br>Will the Member for Anson proceed on those lines?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I move, Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A13, line 41, to leave out from "Ordinance" to the end of line of 44.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have just seen the provision passed whereby the Judge is given no discretion at all in imposing a disability for seven years. There is no

discretion there. There is a discretion about the imprisonment, Sir, but no  discretion  with reference to a man being deprived for seven years of his right  of

voting or standing for election, which seems to me, Sir, in the context of  some

of  those  offences, if you permit me to say en passant, quite disproportionate.

But  I will go on from there, Sir, to the second part where I seek to leave  out

the words,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or of being elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and if at that date

he  is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his seat shall be vacated from the

date of such conviction."



<br><br>Sir,  those are the words I ask to be deleted. But if you will forgive me,  Sir,

if  I might say so, I would like to delete from the word "Assembly" in line  42.

You see, the logic of the position is this.

I say that this Assembly has no power

to  prevent or to require an Assemblyman to vacate his seat under the conditions

pertaining, by virtue of the Constitution under which we work. It has  power  to

prevent  him  from  voting, and it has power to prevent him  from  standing  for

election as a Member of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 734</b></font><br><br>



the Legislative Assembly; but it has no power to require a declaration, -  "and if

at  that  date  he is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his  seat  shall  be

vacated from the date of such conviction."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that event then, is not the Member for Anson asking leave, in

effect,  to move another amendment to withdraw his first amendment, and then  to

move the second amendment which is, in effect, to leave out the words "and if at

that  date he is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his seat shall be vacated

from the date of such conviction."?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker. I seek your leave - Mr Speaker, there

has  been some confusion here - to withdraw my first amendment, because I  would

like to limit it exclusively to the position of Legislative Assemblyman.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that the first amendment be

withdrawn?  That is to leave out four lines. No dissenting voice? The  amendment

is  withdrawn.  The amendment now to be proposed by the Member for  Anson  which

raises  this legal question is that the words from "Assembly" in line 42 to  the

end  of  line  44 be left out. I trust the Minister has got the position  clear.

Will the Member please move?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I would like to draw your attention to section 42 of-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member please move formally for the record?

<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, I formally move the deletion of all

words from the word "Assembly" in page A13, line 42 up to the end of line 44.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw your attention to section 42 of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in

Council,  1958,  Sir, under which this Assembly works and where its  powers  are

defined. Section 42 deals with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 735</b></font><br><br>



tenure of office of Members of the Assembly. Sir, section 42 (3) states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, if any Member of the

Assembly is sentenced by a court in any pant of Her Majesty's dominions to death

or  to  imprisonment (by whatever name called) for a term of or exceeding twelve

months, he shall forthwith cease to exercise any of his functions as a Member...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is definite, Sir. ". . . and his seat in the Assembly shall become

vacant  at  the expiration of a period of thirty days thereafter: ". So  let  us

take it in stages, Sir. The moment he is convicted to twelve months or more,  he

ceases  functioning as a Member but his seat does not become vacant until thirty

days after. And then there is a proviso, Sir, which is a paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that the Speaker may, at the request of the Member, from time to

time  extend that period for further periods of thirty days to enable the Member

to  pursue any appeal in respect of his conviction or sentence, so however  that

extensions  of  time exceeding in the aggregate three hundred  and  thirty  days

shall  not  be  given  without  the  approval  of  the  Assembly  signified   by

resolution."

<br><br>So  the position is, Sir, first, the moment he is convicted to twelve months  or

more  he ceases to function. After thirty lays, his seat is vacated, unless  you

hear  from him that he is appealing, and in the exercise of your discretion  you

grant  him an extension of thirty days. Then his appeal not having come on,  you

can  give  him another extension of thirty days for eleven months in  all,  Sir.

That  is  to say, eleven months in addition to the first month. A total  of  one

year. Mr Speaker, then you have proviso (b):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If at any time before the Member vacates his seat he is granted a free pardon

or  his  conviction  is  set aside or his sentence  is  reduced  to  a  term  of

imprisonment  of less than twelve months or a punishment other than imprisonment

is  substituted, his seat in the Assembly shall not become vacant . . . and  he

may resume . . . his functions...".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see the scheme, Mr Speaker. I would like to draw your attention also to

the provision of section 42 (2) (h). Subsection (2), the operative words are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seat of a Member shall become vacant",

<br><br>and under paragraph (h):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"if he becomes subject to any of the disqualifications specified in paragraphs

(f), (h) and (i) of section 41 of this Order."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 736</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is legislation by reference. Let us go to section 41, Sir. And we

come  to paragraph (f), under any law for the time being when he is adjudged  of

unsound mind. That is not valid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (h) is the one. He is disqualified for membership of the Assembly

under  any  law  for the time being in force in Singapore relating  to  offences

connected with elections. Now, Sir, if he is disqualified for membership under a

law  in  connection with elections, then he must vacate his seat. I want you  to

notice  the  vital  words there, Sir, - "any law for the time being  in  force  in

Singapore  relating  to offences connected with elections". "elections"  is  the

operative word, not with a referendum but with "elections". I am not seeking  to

score over the Government here, Sir, I feel it my duty to draw the attention  of

this  Assembly  to the fact that in my view we would he acting  ultra  vires  in

making  a  provision for the vacation of an Assemblyman's seat contrary  to  the

provisions of the Constitution under which we are working. I am quite sure  that

nobody  wants  to  indicate - whatever their personal views - official  contempt  by

seeking  to  pass  laws which we know are unlawful. You know,  Sir,  that  under

section  105, we can change that provision ourselves. But under section 105,  we

require  a  two-thirds majority of all the Members in the Assembly.  So  I  urge

merely this, Sir, that we be conscious of the legal obstacle to the procedure we

are  seeking to adopt, that we cannot, contrary to the provisions of section  42

of  the  Constitution, compel a Member to vacate his seat in connection  with  a

referendum  offence, otherwise in accordance with the provisions of  section  42

(3) of the Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the

precedents  which  the Select Committee considered on the  holding  of  national

referenda  have  either  imported  the identical  provisions  of  the  electoral

procedures  and  the  laws governing the holding of general elections  into  the

referendum  legislation  itself,  or have specifically  required  that  recourse

should be had to the procedures set out in the laws governing the holding of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 737</b></font><br><br>



general  elections  for the purpose of holding the national referendum.  In  the

holding  of national referenda, existing electoral procedures are used  and  the

electors  are invited to make a choice of issues. In a general election  or  by-election, the electors are invited to make a choice of candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been advised by the State Advocate-General that although in sec

tion  39 of the Order in Council, Members of the Assembly are held to be persons

qualified  for  election,  in accordance with the provisions  of  the  Order  in

Council  and  elected in the manner provided by or under any law  for  the  time

being  enforced  in Singapore, the disqualifications arising under  sections  41

(h) and 42 (h) of the Order in Council -

to  which  the  Member  for  Anson  has just referred - from  the  commission  of

offences connected with the elections are not technically restricted to offences

connected  with  elections to the Assembly. Had that been  the  intention,  this

would  have been spelt out by the use of such words as "offences connected  with

elections to the Assembly" in these sections of the Order in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General has further indicated that if this had been the

intention  a  definition would have been provided for the  word  "elections"  in

section 1 (1) of the Order in Council.

And  he  draws  attention  to the fact that although "Assembly",  "Session"  and

"Sitting" are provided with definitions in section 1(1) of the Order in Council,

no  definition has been provided for the word "elections", Sir, It  would  therefore  appear that the disqualifications involving the vacation of seats  by  Members  of the Assembly who are guilty of offences under clauses 32, 38 and 42  of

the  Bill are not ultra vires the provisions of sections 41 (h) and 42 (h)  of

the  Order in Council. As to section 42 (3) of the Order in Council to which the

Member  for  Anson  referred just now, it deals with  cases  where  persons  are

convicted  of  offences under the Elections Ordinance or  under  the  Referendum

Bill. In these cases, there must be time given to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 738</b></font><br><br>



person who is convicted to appeal. This subsection of the Order in Council gives

the convicted person that opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry to pursue

an  academic point, Sir, which may be of no ultimate interest. And I still feel -

and  I am still convinced - that somewhere there is a misunderstanding between the

Minister  and myself, because I am convinced that in law this is ultra vires.  I

would  like to draw his attention to the word "elections". He says quite rightly

that  it  was not defined. But if he will remember, Sir, at the date  when  this

Constitution  was  promulgated in 1958, we had at that time a City  Council  and

elections to the City Council. We had provisions. I think, in mind for elections

to other organisations.

So, a provision there - and it was possibly an oversight - was specifically intended for

elections. The issue of referendum had not occurred to the draftsman. It was not

available.  It  does specifically limit the disqualification to disqualification

in  respect of offences in connection with elections. We cannot avoid  that  and

say  "elections"  includes "referendum". To suggest that, Sir,  is  I  say  with

respect  an  absurdity. The difficulty about the limb in  clause  32  are  these

words:

"... if at that date he is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, his seat shall

be vacated from the date of such conviction." It is not merely he shall cease to

function,  which the Article provides, but his seat shall be vacated,  and  this

is,  if  you will notice, Sir, in direct contravention of the wording of section

42  (3)  which  'puts  the  vacation of the seat at a  period  of  30  days  and

subsequent  periods not exceeding 11 of additional 30 days, it means in  effect,

Sir - if  I am right - that they cannot achieve any vacation of his seat at  all  by

this  ultra vires provision. If they would like to amend it to permit him to  be

dealt  with, and I say, Sir, its deletion would permit him to be dealt  with  in

accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Article.  Because  the  Minister  has

indicated  earlier that there is a discretion in the Judge to  convict  him  and

sentence  him  to  a  term of imprisonment not exceeding  two  years.  He  might

sentence him to six months. He might sentence him to one day, Sir. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 739</b></font><br><br>



I  have known such cases to occur where there is no power of fine. Now, Sir,  if

you  sentence  him to one day, the provisions for vacation of his seat  in  this

section are completely contrary to section 42 (3) of the Constitution. I feel  I

must register that point of view. I can assure you I shall not trouble the House

with a division on a matter of this character.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> There can be a lot of arguments on this legal question and this is

not the appropriate forum for such arguments.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose the only way to do it is for a Member to commit an

<br><br><div align="center"><b>  [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Bill was first put before the House, we in the Barisan Sosialis

missed this vital point until its importance was pointed out to us by the Member

for  Anson in his amendment, and the P.A.P. now says that it is because of  this

amendment  that  they have put in, the blank paper clause.  They  say  that  the

person  who has moved this amendment is a Communist. Well, I do not know whether

or  not they want to call the Member for Anson a Communist. But it does look  as

if when it is convenient to the P.A.P.-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Can I hear that again?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of

order, Sir. Mr Mammen, I have at no time in this Assembly called the Member for

Anson a Communist. Can the Member for Queenstown tell me when I said

it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Nobody has ever said it.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I ask them a

simple  question,  Sir. Now it hurts them. That is the whole trouble.  They  say

that the person who put in this amendment has evil intentions and the person who

has  such evil intentions, according to historical records, is obviously the Member for Anson. Nobody else, Sir. And they say that such evil intentions were all

Communist inspired. Of course, Sir, to the P.A.P., whenever it is convenient

- whether  it  be  the  Member  for Anson or even the  Member  for  Cairnhill,  I

suppose - they will put the label on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the discussions and debate in Select Committee, we have come to

realise  the  importance of a point which we missed earlier  on.  An  individual

should be free to deface his own ballot paper. This clause should be linked with

the  P.A.P. plot of placing before the voter two unacceptable questions. Let  me

ask the Minister opposite whether it is a crime for him to slap his own face.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Slap yourself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because if you deface your own ballot paper, it amounts to

slapping your own face, it is definitely no crime against society. You only want

to  punish any person if he has committed a crime against society. And the  fact

that  this new sub-clause (2) of clause 31 has been introduced, is proof  enough

that the Government have accepted the logic of our arguments because if you will

remember,  Sir,  this  sub-clause (2) was never in the  original  Bill.  In  the

original  Bill,  anybody who intentionally defaces or intentionally  destroys  a

ballot paper will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 741</b></font><br><br>



punished  according to the list of punishment on page A13. The fact that  Government  have  now made it a lighter sentence and a lighter punishment  is  already

proof enough that they have accepted the logic of our argument that it is not  a

crime against society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you turn to the first paragraph of column 412 of the Official Report of the

Select Committee dated 16th May, you will see that we had to consult the Concise

Oxford Dictionary, and the definition of "deface" is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mar appearance or beauty of, disfigure; discredit; make illegible.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, you can see that when you say deface, you have made it exceptionally vague, and the word "deface" can be open to a great variety of interpretations. What do you mean by "deface", Sir? According to the definition, it

means "to mar the appearance or beauty of". Well, any worker, any fitter or  any

hawker, if he should not have a good bath and wash his hands beforehand  and  if

he should go in and dirty the ballot paper -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, no.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - he "mars



the appearance or beauty of".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The Member misunderstands intentionally.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well, according to the definition, "deface" means that,

Sir. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> How do you say "intentionally defaces" then? If a fitter

forgets  to wash his hands, is it considered therefore that he has intentionally

defaced-



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> May I refer the Member for Queenstown to clause 23 of the BiIl? I

will read clause 23:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A voter who has inadvertently dealt with his ballot paper in such manner that

it  cannot  be  conveniently used as a ballot paper may, on  delivering  to  the

presiding officer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 742</b></font><br><br>



the  ballot  paper so inadvertently dealt with, and on proving the fact  of  the

inadvertence to the satisfaction of the presiding officer, obtain another ballot

paper  in  place  of  the  ballot paper so delivered  up,  hereinafter  in  this

Ordinance  referred to as a "spoilt ballot paper", and the spoilt  ballot  paper

shall be immediately cancelled by the presiding officer."



<br><br>So,  if  he has inadvertently spoilt his ballot paper, he can get a fresh ballot

paper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I realise that, Sir, but all the same, the word 'defaces'

is  a  little  vague and according to the definition of the Concise  Oxford  Dictionary,  mar  appearance  can  mean deface, disfigure  can  mean  deface,  make

illegible can mean deface. Therefore, it can be open to a lot of interpretation.

But I want to bring your attention back to the plot of the P.A.P. If you will remember, Sir, in the Elections Ordinance, section 51, sub-section (1) says, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every person who forges or fraudulently defaces or fraudulently destroys".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the words are: "Every person who fraudulently defaces". It does not say

"intentionally defaces" and these words "intentionally defaces" have been put in

to  fit in with their plot of forcing the voters to go to vote and to force  the

voter to choose between unacceptable alternatives. The heavy penalty, of course,

is  to deter the voter from even showing his protest and disgust at the question

posed  to  him  by  defacing the ballot paper. I am sure  you  can  imagine  the

situation, Sir, where such revolting and unacceptable alternatives are presented

to you and in showing your disgust you possibly may scribble all over the ballot

paper,  draw  any picture you like, or even make the words on the  ballot  paper

illegible,  and  under  those  circumstances, it is  considered  that  you  have

intentionally defaced the ballot paper and you are supposed to be  punished  for

this  offence. We consider that if such a voter is faced with such  unacceptable

alternatives, there is no other way for him to show his disgust. He  is  already

forced to go along to the voting booth and forced to write something on the  ballot  paper. In the circumstances, there is nothing more fitting than to scribble

all over the ballot paper. Yet the Government want to consider this natural reaction criminal, if anything, it is definitely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 743</b></font><br><br>



not  criminal.  I do not think I have to go further into this.  But  I  have  to

expose  this  falsehood and lie of the P.A.P. that it was the intention  of  the

Communists  and  the  pro-Communists  to  deface  the  ballot  paper,  that  the

Government have to counter this so-called Communist move by putting in the blank

ballot paper clause. This original amendment, as I have already pointed out, was

moved by the Member for Anson. If they want to pinpoint that as a Communist or a

pro-Communist  move, then I suggest that they ask the Member for  Anson  for  an

explanation.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen. Sir, I would

like  to point out briefly that because of the word "deface" and because of  its

multiple interpretations, therefore, we are of the opinion that this word should

be  deleted from this Bill, because if it is not deleted, situation will  arise.

Mr  Mammen,  you will recollect in our previous debate that I also pointed  out

that if the electors are faced with two unacceptable alternatives, they may draw

a tortoise or a bird on the ballot paper to show their anger. Under these circumstances,  if  a person draws a tortoise or a bird on the paper, and this  ballot

paper  is  deemed to be in support of the Government and at the  same  time  the

Government want to punish this person, that is to say, after deeming this ballot

paper  as  the Government's, yet at the same time they want to punish him,  then

that is very ridiculous and unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amnendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A14, line 6, to leave out from "year" to the end of line 14 and insert

"or a fine".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to draw your attention to this sub-clause (2). It refers to a person

who intentionally defaces or destroys a ballot paper. It makes him guilty of  an

offence  and it gives the court a discretion to imprison him up to a year.  Sir,

fair  enough, there is a discretion. But then it makes it a compulsion that  for

three  years thereafter he is incapable of being registered as an elector or  of

voting  at  a  referendum  or  of  voting at any election  under  the  Singapore

Legislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance, or of being elected a Member  of  the

Legislative  Assembly. If he is a Member of the Legislative  Assembly, he  must

forthwith  vacate his seat. What is the purpose of this sadistic provision,  for

sadistic it is, Sir? Here is a man who is destroying his own ballot paper. I say

it to you, Mr Mammen, that nowhere in the world can you find the equal of this.

If  they  tell you they have got it from section 51 of the Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance, let me read it to you-section 51(1) (a) - look at the  scheme

of  that  clause, the words are -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'forges or fraudulently defaces or fraudulently

destroys  any nomination paper, or delivers to the Returning Officer any  nomination paper knowing the same to be forged,'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 745</b></font><br><br>



Sir, the word 'fraudulent' is defined in the

Penal Code as a fraud. A fraud is to seek

to bring about loss or gain, dishonestly.

I  think to bring about loss or gain to any particular person. The whole  scheme

is  there to show you that the purpose is to defraud in some way the public  and

the  people  of  Singapore by an act whereby the document is  forged  or  is  so

defaced  that  it can be deemed to be somebody else's or in favour  of  somebody

else.

There is no question where you destroy

your own for purposes of negativing any vote at all. You are defrauding nobody.

But look, Sir, I know that this has been argued and I have not sought to prolong

the debate. If it is thought necessary to make it an offence, by all means leave

it  to  a Judge. I say at least give him the discretion to fine. You know,  Sir,

that  in  Western  Samoa  where the United Nations  was  in  control,  being  in

possession  of  a ballot paper was one of the very few offences,  and  that  was

merely  punishable  by  50  pounds maximum. Let us be  a  little  sober  in  our

approach.



<br><br>8.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that all I am asking here is that you give a discretion to the Judge to

fine or to imprison. It is nonsense that a poor man who seeks to deface his  own

ballot  paper,  because  he  does not like your  questions,  must  therefore  be

deprived  of  his  civic rights of voting and standing for  election  for  three

years. This intemperate vengefulness of the P.A.P. is uncalled for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Anson will look at

clause  32  (1) (a) he will see that any intentional defacement or  intentional

destruction  of  a  ballot  paper  belonging  to  another  is  punishable   with

imprisonment up to two years and with a deprivation of civic rights up to  seven

years. After a lot of argument in the Select Committee, the Government agreed to

make a distinction between the intentional defacement or intentional destruction

of one's own ballot paper and the ballot paper belonging to another. It was as a

result  of  the  representation from Opposition Members of the Select  Committee

that clause 32 (2) was put into this Bill, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 746</b></font><br><br>



provides  for a lesser penalty of imprisonment up to one year and a  deprivation

of civic rights up to three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, on the question of the deprivation of civic rights, it is

necessary  that  the deprivation should be indicated by the Legislature  itself,

otherwise  it would result in inequalities if the deprivation were to vary  from

person  to person, should the power to deprive be left to the discretion of  the

Court.  As  I have pointed out before, these are grave offences, and it  is  the

practice in the framing of legislation to provide penalties of imprisonment  for

grave  offences. If they are light and trivial offences, the appropriate penalty

would  be a fine. As these are grave offences, they are appropriately punishable

with imprisonment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I notice that this provision has generated

a  lot of heat from the Member for Anson. May I suggest, Sir, that the boundless

energy  of the Member for Anson could be more profitably used to persuade voters

not to commit such an offence?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, at least I am obliged to the Minister for Home

Affairs  for  his courtesy, even though I can find no profit in the  vacuity  of

ideas of his statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to come to the Minister for Law. He says quite rightly that the Government

had all of them together, whereby we would all be punished with a maximum of two

years  and  suffer  mandatory consequential punishment of deprivation  of  civic

rights  of  voting  for  seven years. But I would like you  to  understand,  Mr

Mammen,  that  the  Opposition did not agree that the defacement  of  one's  own

ballot paper was a matter of gravity, and I am more than surprised that the  Minister  should so consider it, because whom does it harm, Sir? Wherein  lies  the

gravity  of  destroying your own ballot paper? The Opposition never agreed  that

that should be punishable with one year. We leave it alone now, Sir, and make it

maximum, because after all you are leaving it to the good sense of a Judge.  And

I  say,  give  him  the  option of a fine. But what  I  do  object  to  is  this

unnecessary provision whereby it is mandatory. The Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 747</b></font><br><br>



says  quite rightly that if there is a deprivation of civic rights it should  be

specified. That is correct. But it can be specified as an exercise of discretion

on  the part of a Judge. He can be given the discretion to exercise his right to

declare  that  the  person  is  prohibited from participating  in  elections  or

standing  for elections himself or sitting in the Assembly. But he is  not  even

giving the Judge that discretion, Sir. The man who defaces his ballot paper will

have  to suffer as a matter of legal requirement. The Judge has no power.  There

is in fact in these clauses considerable contempt shown for judicial discretion.

They  will  allow him to exercise the right to decide how much imprisonment  the

man should get, but they will not allow him to decide whether the man should  be

deprived  of his civic rights or for how many years he should be deprived.  That

is mandatory. And let us recognise, Sir, that these are important rights.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Just one point, Mr

Chairman. On all questions of the deprivation of civic rights, the penalties  imposed  should  be  uniform,  and  it is quite correct  that  it  should  be  the

Legislature itself which should determine the period of the deprivation. If  you

leave  it  to  a  judicial  discretion, it would mean that  varying  periods  of

deprivation  will  be imposed.That is quite wrong. It is always  necessary  that

there  should  be a uniform period of deprivation. That is why  that  period  of

deprivation  must  be  set by the Legislature itself and  not  by  the  judicial

tribunal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ In page A18, line 25, to leave out "of seven" and insert "not exceeding three".

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am not moving it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A18, to leave out lines 25 to 32 inclusive and insert "may be declared

incapable  for up to a period of seven years from the date of his conviction  of

being registered as an elector or of voting at a referendum under this Ordinance

or  of voting at any election under the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

Ordinance".



<br><br>I  will not take up your time, Sir. We seem to have thrashed this out and  I  am

very sorry indeed that the Government has not seen its way to concede what is  a

very  important principle. Let us assume, and I am not satisfied  that  this  is

correct, that a uniform period of deprivation of civic rights is necessary.  Let

us  assume that for the moment, although no precedent has been indicated. I say,

what  is wrong with giving the Judge the discretion in deciding whether to apply

that deprivation or not? Have we not any trust, any confidence in our Judges? Is

this  seriously  the  P.A.P. approach to the judiciary which  has  for  so  long

striven  and  so well earned its reputation, for being balanced,  for  being  of

integrity  beyond  any shadow of doubt? What is the P.A.P. afraid  of?  I  will

withdraw  the word "afraid". Why does the P.A.P. not wish to leave the  matter  to

the  discretion  of  our courts? If not the period, at least the  issue  whether

there  should or should not be disqualification, this deprivation of citizenship

rights. I am not saying it is too harsh in certain circumstances, but I do  urge

that  the  principle  be  respected that where  this  Assembly  sets  a  maximum

sentence, the Judge be given discretion whether to apply it or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Mammen, similar provisions are scattered throughout the law.

There  are  many, many provisions laying down similar deprivations, deprivations

not affecting civic rights, but





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 749</b></font><br><br>



which  are  nevertheless deprivations. For instance, if one uses a motor-car  to

commit  a  criminal  offence,  the motor-car can  be  forfeited.  Similarly,  in

smuggling  offences, if one uses motor-cars or other movable  property  for  the

commission  of  these  offences,  one can be deprived  of  that  property.  This

provision  is not something entirely new in the law and that is very  well-known

to the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen,

Sir,  the  penalty  is, so severe because the offences are  of  a  very  serious

nature. If you look at clause 38 (1) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Every person who-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) commits the offences of personation, or aids, abets, counsels or procures

the commission of the offence of personation; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) commits the offence of treating, undue influence or bribery,'.

<br><br>Mr Mammen, I am sure the House will agree that these are very serious offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear the Barisan Sosialis accusing Syngman Rhee of being a corrupt

dictator,  famous for rigging elections. Here we see them trying to  weaken  the

very safeguard designed to ensure that voting should be conducted in a clean and

fair  manner. Mr Mammen, we do not want voting in our State to degenerate  into

the  same  state  of affairs as happened in South Korea. It is, therefore,  very

necessary to prescribe the punishment in this Bill so that whoever harbours  the

intention  of  trying to treat or bribe other persons during the  election  will

think twice before he does any such thing.



<br><br>8.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I do not know if the Minister is under the

impression  that I am in the Barisan, but it was I who moved this amendment  and

the  Barisan  withdrew theirs, Sir. So it is hardly fair to the Barisan  to  say

that  they are seeking to undermine the basis of a fair referendum. It  is  true

that they are suggesting that they are supporting my amendment, but the Minister

must be fair, Sir, I have not said and I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 750</b></font><br><br>



sure they are not going to say that the punishment is necessarily too severe  in

this  clause. It was in the previous clause, but now we are dealing with  clause

38.  All  we say here is, why not give the Judge a discretion? It is a principle

and a very important principle. But since he talks about gravity, Mr Mammen, as

a  curiosity, will you permit me, this will not take very long? I have before me

the  Australian  Commonwealth Acts, 1901 to 1950, Vol. 5. For  "treating",  Sir,

section 43 - �200 fine or imprisonment for one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any person who after the issue of a referendum supplies to any elector meat,

drink or entertainment, horse or carriage hire with a view to influence his vote

in connection with the referendum, shall be guilty of the offence',



<br><br>and the fine is �200 or one year; no disqualification..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we come to bribery. "Any person who gives, confers. . ." the bribe,

Sir; penalty, �200 or imprisonment for one year. That is section 44.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, undue influence, section 46, we have penalty - �200 or imprisonment

for one year; no deprivation of civic rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they talk of wanting a clean referendum. What I should have liked to see,

Sir,  if  I might draw your attention to it, and I know that I for one  on  this

side of the House would be very happy to give them leave to move it even at this

late  stage,  is  the  provision  of  section  48  (1)  (b)  of  the  Referendum

(Constitution Alteration) Act and this is how it reads, Mr Mammen:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Every person who print, publishes or distributes any advertisement or

document  containing  any untrue or incorrect statement intended  or  likely  to

mislead  or  improperly  interfere with any elector in or  in  relation  to  the

casting of his vote at the referendum, shall be guilty of an offence.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true the penalty is only �100, in this instance, it should be more. Why

have we not got that clause? Need I draw the inference, Mr Mammen?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Mammen, just now the Minister for Home Affairs has replied to the amendment

by the Member for Anson, saying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 751</b></font><br><br>



that  the reason why there is such a provision is that the Barisan Sosialis  has

constantly attacked the P.A.P. Just like Syngman Rhee of South Korea, the P.A.P.

wants to prevent the corrupt practices during the election, as was the condition

in South Korea. That is why there is such a provision to prescribe the penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has been very eloquent in his

argument.  His argument appears to be very attractive but, in fact, the  purpose

of  this  provision  is not to prevent the so-called corrupt  practices  as  was

practised by Syngman Rhee. The Member for Anson has moved this amendment,  which

is  a  very fair one, as it only requests that cases of offence should be  dealt

with  by a Judge and not left to the Assembly to decide on the penalties. If  we

want  to  prevent corrupt practices as was practised by Syngman Rhee,  then  all

laws  will not be able to prevent such acts. In fact, clauses 5 and 29 show that

the  Government is actually corrupt. That also goes to show that the P.A.P.  Government acts like Syngman Rhee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, the reply of the Minister for Home Affairs is very in

appropriate.  The Member for Anson has quoted examples of the law in  Australia,

and  I hope the Minister for Home Affairs will consider our amendment and accept

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, we are going round and round, in a merry-go-round,

with  the  Member  for  Anson.  There is this same provision  in  the  Singapore

Legislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance. The same penalties are provided,  and

the  discretion  is  not  with the court. It is laid  down  by  the  Legislative

Assembly.  We have not introduced anything new at all to do anybody in.  We  are

just  following  the  same practice that there is in the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly Elections Ordinance. Where is the wrong in that?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 752</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I seem to have heard from the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang  that  he believes in the impartiality of  our  Judges  and  our

Judiciary. If I am correct - please correct me if I am wrong - the Member  For  Choa

Chu  Kang  has  said  all  this - may I refer him to his own  organ,  the  Barisan

(especially  the  Chinese edition) wherein you could read how contemptuous  they

are of our Judiciary?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of information, Sir, if the Minister will permit. Can

I  enquire from the Minister where and what issue that is, and what date, if  he

would be good enough to indicate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, I am afraid I am not able to give you the

specific  dates  of the various copies. But, I think, since he has  the  Barisan

Members  in  front  of  him, perhaps they will be able to supply  him  with  the

necessary information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen,

if  you  will  remember in Select Committee, the Member for  Anson  was  of  the

opinion  that the provision of clause 41 as at present would have the effect  of

prohibiting  Press statements and reports of referendum meetings in the  papers,

and so forth. Although we disagreed with the opinion of the Member for Anson  in

the  interpretation  of  this clause, nevertheless, to make  the  posilion  less

ambiguous, we promised to look into the wording of this clause again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments before the House have also taken into account the views of the

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position now is that during the referendum period, badges, rosettes,

favours,  handbills, advertisements, and replicas of ballot papers will  now  be

permitted during the period of any referendum except on polling day. As  assured

by  the  Government  on  the  Second Reading of the  Bill,  canvassing  will  be

prohibited  only on polling day. Symbols, sets of colours, banners,  flags,  and

placards  will  now  be permitted on the days and sites of referendum  meetings.

Only  posters other than those of the Superintendent will continue to be totally

prohibited. The Superintendent-



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I wonder if the Minister



would permit, on a point of elucidation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you. Mr

Mammen,  I  would  like to ask: is the intention of this  clause  41  about  the

symbols,  sets  of  colours, banners, placards, as political propaganda - does  it

mean  political  propaganda with reference to the referendum  only?  I  am  much

obliged, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I was saying

just now that only posters other than those of the Superintendent will continue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 754</b></font><br><br>



to be totally prohibited. The Superintendent is exempted so as to enable him to

put up factual or instructional posters concerning the matter under referendum.

These posters are particularly important-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen):

Order. Time for suspension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker thereupon left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 41-(cont.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 41 - an amendment in the name of the Minister for Home

Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I was explaining about the prohibition of posters before the adjournment.

Now, coming back to this question of posters, Mr Speaker, Sir, under this new

amendment only posters other than those of the Superintendent will continue to

be totally prohibited. The Superintendent is exempted so as to enable him to put

up factual or instructional posters concerning a referendum. I was saying just

now that these posters are particularly important as this is the first

referendum to be held by the State. It is important, therefore, that the factual

or instructional posters put up by the Superintendent should not be blotted out

by or confused with posters of political Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also to be remembered that in a referendum only a national issue is involved and the referendum as such will be conducted on a national basis. No

posters therefore will be necessary to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 755</b></font><br><br>





advertise  the  candidates' pictures nor the symbols of  candidates  or  of  the

respective political Parties which will be essential in the case of an election.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I pose the question, may I know from the Member for Anson

whether  he  is moving his amendment (iii)* in the light of amendment  (i)+  and

amendment (ii)++ ? I think the Member for Anson has not heard me.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Amendment (i), in the name of the Minister for Home Affairs, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A20, line 13, to leave out, from "(1)" to the end of line 20 and insert "No person shall wear, use, carry or display or cause to be worn, used, carried or displayed any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner or placard as political propaganda during the period of any referendum:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the use or display of any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner or placard on the day and at the site of a referendum meeting.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++ Amendment (ii), in the name of Dr Lee Siew Choh, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A20, line 13, to leave out from "(1)" to the end of line 20 and insert "No badge, symbol, rosette, favour, set of colours, flag, banner, advertisement, handbill, placard or poster or any replica of a ballot paper shall be worn, used, carried or displayed by any person or on any motor-car, truck, or other vehicle as political propaganda on polling day".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Amendment (iii), in the name of Mr Marshall, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A20, line 19, to leave out from "paper" to the end of line 20 and insert "as political propaganda on polling day".

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, I am looking at the amendment. It is a little

confusing.  You  see, Sir, if you will forgive me, amendment (iii)  is  distinct

from amendment (i) in that it merely prohibits these matters from being utilised

on  Polling  Day,  whereas the Minister seeks to prohibit the use  of  political

symbols,  colours,  flags,  banners or placards  during  the  entire  referendum

period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well, I did say in the light of amendment (i) and amendment

(ii),  where  the  Member for Queenstown is seeking to amend that  part  of  the

amendment to the Minister for Home Affairs. Instead of "during the period of any

referendum", the Member for Queenstown suggests "on polling day" which seems  to

be almost the same as the amendment to be moved by the Member for Anson, unless,

of course, he does not like this separation of the Superintendent from the other

things.  He  will notice what the Superintendent should do and  what  any  other

person should do is contained in clause 41(i).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker. No, Sir, I would not weary this

House at this late stage with these fine distinctions which might be appropriate

at  another time, and having had my attention drawn to amendment (ii), I can now

state,  Sir, that I shall be accepting amendment (ii) and I shall not be  moving

mine.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Thank you. It has

been moved then as an amendment,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A20, line 13, to leave out, from "(1)" to the end of line 20 and

insert  "No person shall wear, use, carry or display or cause to be worn,  used,

carried  or  displayed any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner  or  placard  as

political propaganda during the period of any referendum:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the use or

display of any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner or placard on the day and at

the site of a referendum meeting.".



As has been indicated, the debate may range over amendment (iv):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A20, line 20, at end, to add

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) No person other than the Superintendent shall make, print, publish, distribute, post up, wear, use, carry or display or cause to be made, printed.

published,  distributed,  posted  up, worn, used,  carried  or  displayed  any

poster   in  connection  with  any  referendum  during  the  period   of   any

referendum.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that that is agreed in amendment (ii). So I propose to put that

Question straightaway, take a vote, and then proceed to the second limb  of  the

amendment - the  insertion  of the words. Is that  suitable  to  the  Member  for

Queenstown?







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not quite follow, Sir. We agreed to the deletion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for

Queenstown  has also asked for the deletion of words from "(1)" to  the  end  of

line 20. And so has the Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is agreed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Then I will put the Question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out," put, and

agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Now the Question is, "That the words proposed to be inserted [by

the amendment proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs], be there inserted."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Very briefly, Sir, I am not going to speak on the principle, but

to  draw  the  attention of the Minister for Home Affairs to one aspect  and  to

enquire  whether  he would consider it, before the main debate ranges  over  the

principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw his attention to the words "as political propaganda" in the amendment

he  has  moved. Sir, if I carry this badge which I have on me now - which  is  the

symbol  of my Party - I take it that it can in law be termed political propaganda.

And  if  I  should  carry  it  during the period of  the  referendum,  it  would

technically be deemed to be the use of a badge for political propaganda. That is

why  I was obliged to the Minister who indicated during his speech when I  rose

on  a point of elucidation that he and this is perfectly natural and proper  did

not  have  in  mind  the normal propaganda, the political Parties'  issues,  the

utilisation  of  their letterheads or the utilisation of their symbols,  in  the

normal  course.  He did not have that in mind at all. What he had  in  mind  was

political  propaganda with reference specifically to the referendum  before  the

people.  And  I ask, Sir - as I said, before the debate went under way - whether  he

would consider that technical aspect and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 758</b></font><br><br>



perhaps seek to substitute the word "referendum" for "political" so that it will

read "referendum propaganda".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Shall we go on with the debate? Perhaps the Minister would like

to have time to consider it unless he is ready with the reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the instance quoted by the Member

for Anson as to the display of party badges is permissible during the referendum

period except on Polling Day. I cannot imagine that during the referendum  there

will  be  any type of political propaganda other than propaganda concerning  the

referendum itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The words are "political propaganda during the period of any

referendum".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, any period of the referendum.



<br><br>9.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to move an amendment to the

amendment of the Minister for Home Affairs. I move, To leave out-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I assist the Member for Queenstown? He obviously wishes to

introduce the terms of his proposed amendment. Is that it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Anson has indicated that he will not be moving

his  amendment (iii). Does the Member for Queenstown wish to delete the  proviso

proposed by the Minister for Home Affairs? Can I have that answer first?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, to leave it out.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Well then, he moves that the words proposed to be inserted by

the Minister be left out, and there to insert his own words.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg to move the amendment* as you have indicated. Sir,

the Government have given an indication that they are going to allow canvassing.

But see what kind of canvassing they are allowing the Opposition. They ask us to

fight  but  they  tie  our hands behind our backs. See what  the  amendment  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs seeks to do? He says. "No person  shall  wear,  use,

carry or display or cause to be worn, used, carried or displayed any symbol, set

of  colours, flag, banner or placard as political propagada during the period of

any referendum." I leave the proviso out of it now. Sir, all these things cannot

be  done  during  the  period  of the referendum. What  is  the  period  of  the

referendum?  The  period  of  the  referendum  is  the  most  vital  period  for

canvassing. The original period of referendum was only seven days. An indication

has already been given to us that the period of the referendum will be increased

to  two  weeks.  In actual fact, therefore, the Government want  to  extend  the

limitation  of canvassing from one week to two weeks. Therefore, it  has  become

worse in many respects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* To leave out:

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, canvassing can be done in many ways. If you

cannot carry any banner or placard, how can you canvass? [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Canvassing for the birds. Well, possibly that is what the

Minister  for  Home Affairs is thinking about. And if we should do  anything  of

this sort, it is considered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 760</b></font><br><br>



to  be  political  propaganda. Anything that the P.A.P. does not  like  will  be

considered  as political propaganda. Let me remind you of the promises  made  by

the  Minister  for  Home Affairs in Select Committee. In  Select  Committee  the

Minister gave an undertaking that he would put in the amendments early, at least

one week beforehand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I have done that.

wrote a letter to us and I will read it to you. [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of information - go ahead. I will give you-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This can come later.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have brought my wrong file today, Sir. Anyway the

Minister can provide us with a copy - I am sure he has a copy of it.

a copy here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In the letter he

informed me in terms of endearment, calling me "Dear Siew Choh" and all that-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know

why without any reason whatsoever, the Member for Queenstown should now generate

heat. Surely he should be thankful for the courtesy which was accorded to him by

the Minister for Home Affairs and not be derisive about it?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, he informed

me  that  he  would prohibit political propaganda and that he  would  not  allow

posters.  Just  a  few  words in principle without giving us  the  details.  The

details  of the amendment came to us only, I think, two days before the  sitting

of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The undertaking he gave to us that he would inform us at

least one week before the sitting day of the amendments has not been kept.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It was kept.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The actual wording of the amendment, not just the general

principle.  It is only by studying the actual wording of the amendment  that  we

know  how to amend the amendment. And unless the actual wording of the amendment

has  been put in, we will not know what the real intention of the Government  is

going  to  be.  That is point number one. But, as usual, promises  mean  nothing

nowadays  to  the P.A.P. They made a lot of promises but all of them  have  been

forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now refer you to the words of the Minister for Home Affairs. On 14th

March, in the Revised Transcript of the Official Report on the Second Reading of

the Singapore National Referendum Bill, page 13, last paragraph [Vol. 17, No. 1,

col. 84], the Minister for Home Affairs said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On a point of information, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said in my speech earlier

that canvassing is allowed except on polling day...'.



<br><br>That is very good, Sir. Now you see what are the words that follow:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . just as in the general elections.'



<br><br>Very  good, Sir. But see what has happened? Restriction of posters  as  in  the

general elections? Nobody can wear, use, carry banners or display placards as in

the  general  elections? Is this the promise of the Minister that  we  would  be

allowed canvassing as in the general elections?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you again, Sir, to the Revised Transcript of the Official Report

on the Second Reading of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 762</b></font><br><br>



Singapore National Referendum Bill dated 16th March, 1962, page 38 [Vol. 17, No.

3,  col.  294].  The  Minister  for Home Affairs  was  again  speaking - second

paragraph, page 38:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I wish to reiterate once again that canvassing will be prohibited onl on

polling  day, just as in the case [now, these are very important words, Sir]  of

any elections in the past.'



<br><br>In other words, Sir, canvassing will be allowed as in any general election. What

do  we  see today? Nobody will he allowed to wear, use, carry or display  flags,

banners or placards as political propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member

should carry on reading that paragraph.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Reading, you suggest, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The same paragraph.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the prohibition on the displaying of flags, banners, symbols, etc, is to

be  confined  only to the period of the referendum. The provision of  referendum

petitions too has been spelt out in a comprehensive form under the new Part V of

the Bill.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What I want to emphasise is this: a promise has been given

that  canvassing will be allowed as in general elections. I can assure you, Sir,

in general elections nobody, no political Party will be debarred from

wearing, using, carrying or displaying flags, banners or placards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of elucidation. Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder if

the Member for Queenstown would be kind enough to let us know his interpretation

of  the  word  "canvassing"? Does "canvassing" mean carrying banners  round  the

town?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister is very impatient. Let him wait. Surely as a

Minister,  and  as  a  person who has gone through three or four  elections,  he

should  know what canvassing means. The P.A.P. has been very meticulous  in  the

copying of sections from the Elections Ordinance when it happens to suit them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I refer you to our Elections Ordinance, section 72, subsection (1)? It

says here, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No badge, symbol, rosette, favour, set of colours, flag, advertisement,

handbill,  placard  or poster or any replica of a voting paper  shall  be  worn,

used,  carried  or displayed by any person or on any motor-car, truck  or  other

vehicle as political propaganda on polling day:'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the P.A.P. have always been quoting sections from the Elections

Ordinance  and  since  we  are  supposed to model our  Referendum  Bill  on  the

Elections  Ordinance,  may I suggest that they accept our amendment,  because  I

have  lifted our amendment, word for word, from section 72, sub-section  (1)  of

this Elections Ordinance? I do not think they can have any complaints, because I

only  seek  that  they allow us canvassing as is allowed now  in  the  Elections

Ordinance.  I  have  already touched on the fact that the referendum  period  is

extended  from  seven to, as we understand, fourteen days. That means  that  the

period in which they want to stop us from doing things will be extended. This is

a period most vital for canvassing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Government have full control of the radio, Rediffusion, and even the

newspapers.  The  Opposition Parties have no opportunities of  putting  up  even

posters.  They  have all these facilities - printing and putting  up  posters  and

sending out pamphlets all the time. We are only asking that we be allowed to  do

the  same. We are not asking anything extraordinary. As it is, they are  already

trying  to limit publicity of the debate. Instances have been quoted to  you  of

the  Government  trying to limit newspaper space for the Opposition  Parties.  I

would  like to quote to you again, Sir, the words of the Prime Minister himself,

words which I quoted two days ago. The Prime Minister in 1955 said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . . we either believe in democracy or we do not.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you believe in democracy, you must believe in it unconditionally. If you believe that men should be free, then they should have the right of free

association,  of  free speech, of free publication. Then no  law  should  permit

those democratic processes to

be set at nought. . . '.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 764</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  these  are  the words of the Prime Minister himself. Yet we  see  the  Government  trying  to  limit these same activities on the part of  the  Opposition

Parties.  The Minister said that during the referendum period only  the  Superintendent  should  be allowed to put up posters because, according  to  him,  only

Government  posters  will  put up a factual report  of  whatever  they  want  to

propagandise. The implication being, Sir, that if the Opposition Parties  should

put  up posters, then these posters will all be on falsehoods or distortions.  I

venture  to  suggest, Sir, that the Government in fact are doing  exactly  that.

They  have  put up a lot of posters, giving a distorted version of Malaysia  and

merger to the people. They are, in fact, using public funds for their own  party

propaganda.  These  are points which we in the Opposition have  tried  to  bring

forward  and  which  the  P.A.P. have prevented us from getting  across  to  the

public. I do not intend to speak very much more now-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Thank goodness!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But just to tell the Government that if they really intend

to  allow canvassing, let there be full canvassing. Let them not make a farce of

this so-called canvassing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> But you are doing it now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because you see, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs intends

that  if  ever  political Parties should use any symbol, set of  colours,  flag,

advertisement or placard, those things can only be used at a referendum meeting.

You  do  not canvass by putting up placards at a referendum meeting. You canvass

by going around telling people what they should know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It depends.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Words can be

put  up  on  banners and the people can look at the banners  and  find  out  for

themselves  the actual state of affairs. In any issue both sides of the  picture

must  be  presented to the people. It is only after all the facts have been  put

before him that the voter will be able to make his own decision.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 765</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might mention, Sir, the difficulties that have been put in our way of

rallies  and meetings. In many places we have to apply for a permit  first  from

the  City  Council for the use of the land, and after that a police  permit.  On

many  occasions  permits  were  issued only at the  very  last  minute  so  that

preparations for such meetings and rallies were restricted and hamstrung. Again,

on many occasions our requests for rallies were rejected on the poor excuse that

certain playgrounds and parks could only be used during general elections. I  do

not  know,  Sir,  whether or not such areas and parks and  playgrounds  will  be

allowed  during  the referendum period when full canvassing is  supposed  to  be

allowed and referendum meetings are permitted to be held. But this amendment  of

the  Minister for Home Affairs makes nonsense of the original promise  to  allow

full canvassing as in a general election. We cannot possibly canvass without the

use of posters. The Minister himself should know that posters have to be put  up

in  places  to inform the people of the facts when we cannot personally  deliver

that message. People may be working; very few people may be in their houses; and

we  may  not  meet all the people we would like to meet when we  go  around  canvassing.  But  if  we are allowed posters, at least there is  a  possibility  of

people looking at the posters and seeing the other side of the picture from  the

Government's. As it is, only the Government have such facilities. We  feel   the P.A.P.

are  taking  an unfair advantage of the Opposition Parties. Let the  P.A.P. not

make a farce of their promise to allow full canvassing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, I might add that it was the original intention of the P.A.P.

to prohibit canvassing completely. If

you remember, Sir, the original intention of the P.A.P. was to put one question,

but  later  on when they realised that their own merger proposals would  not  be

acceptable to the people, they conceived the two-question snap referendum  plot.

There  is provision for the P.A.P. to take advantage of the confusion that  will

be caused in the minds of the people by their posing of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 766</b></font><br><br>



two  questions. Now that they have this blank paper saviour sure-win clause they

have  relaxed  on  canvassing.  But  in spite  of  their  wanting  to  relax  on

canvassing, they insist on restricting canvassing to the minimum. Their  present

amendment seeks to do just that. They want to say that there is canvassing,  and

to  give the appearance that they are democrats; but, in actual fact, they  want

to  make  sure that canvassing on the part of the Opposition will be limited  as

much  as  possible. Possibly, Sir, it is because the P.A.P. themselves  have  no

more  organisation  to  go out canvassing nowadays and have  to  depend  on  the

propaganda machinery of the Government to do P.A.P. work.



<br><br>10.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister says nonsense. Let him prove it by giving us

full facilities for canvassing as in the general election.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It has been moved as an amendment to insert after "(i) In

page A20, line 13:" the following words:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall wear, use, curry or display or cause to be worn, used,

carried  or  displayed any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner  or  placard  as

political propaganda during the period of any referendum:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the use or

display of any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner or placard on the day and at

the site of a referendum meeting.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been moved, as an amendment

to that amendment, to leave out all those words and there to insert:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No budge, symbol, rosette, favour, set of colours, flag, banner,

advertisement,  handbill, placard or poster or any replica  of  a  ballot  paper

shall  be  worn,  used, carried or displayed by any person or on any  motor-car,

truck, or other vehicle as political propaganda on polling day".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words

proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I cannot agree to the amendment of the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs.  I  cannot agree to what he has said in relation to  his  amendment  to

clause  41. He has just now mentioned his so-called reasons when he says that  a

national referendum has nothing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 767</b></font><br><br>



do  with a general election; and it has nothing to do with political Parties  be

cause  there are no candidates waiting to be elected, and it is rather different

from a general election. No political Parties or candidates are involved. But  I

am  of the opinion that his reasoning is groundless, because up till now we know

that  the  Government in the national referendum will pose two  questions  which

will  be framed according to the Government's interpretation of what the  stands

of the other political Parties are in relation to merger. Therefore, it is clear

that  during  the process of holding a national referendum, there will  be  much

significance  of  party  politics. That also is to be seen  from  the  form  the

Government is going to pose the two questions and how the Government will  frame

the  two questions. According to the Government's explanation, one question will

represent the standpoint of the Party in power; the other question will  be  the

so-called  stand  of  the Opposition Parties as interpreted by  the  Government.

Therefore, what the Minister for Home Affairs has said just now, that  there  is

no  party politics in a national referendum, cannot hold water. Therefore, it is

necessary to have sufficient time for the political Parties concerned to explain

their stands and views. Although the controversy over the question of merger has

been  going  on for quite a long time, the form of the questions in relation  to

merger has only recently become slightly clearer. One thing that should be noted

especially  is  that  we  intend to move a motion to  condemn  the  Government's

distortion of our stand. Therefore, it is all the more necessary to let us  have

sufficient time to explain to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us assume that the Government does not distort our stand,

assuming that the other question to be posed by the Government is also our stand

on  merger. But this House has never had sufficient time to debate our stand and

our  explanation in relation to our merger proposals, such as the form, the time

and  consequences of merger. Therefore, under these circumstances, granted  that

the Government does not distort our stand, it is only fair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 768</b></font><br><br>



that it should allow us to have more time during a national referendum to do our

canvassing work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has just now said that there are

many  forms  of  canvassing, and that it is not necessary  to  use  placards  or

posters.  We  cannot agree with him because nobody can deny  that  the  cartoons

drawn  on  the  placards  and  posters will be more  effective  than  words  in

explaining  the  various stands and views. An example can be  drawn  from  advertising  companies which advertise mainly by means of cartoons drawn on  placards

and posters rather than by using words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the amendment of the Minister for Home Affairs that - I draw your

attention to the proviso-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Provided that the provisions of this subsection shall

not apply to the use or display of any symbol, set of colours, flag, banner or

placard on the day and at the site of a referendum meeting.'



<br><br>We  know  the period of the national referendum is rather short. During  such  a

short  period  political Parties find it impossible to have sufficient  time  to

carry on canvasting in various parts of the island and to hold meetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has passed the most important provision

relating  to  blank votes and the provision prohibiting the people  to  say  no.

Therefore,  on the question of a national referendum, fundamentally  the  Government  has  already assured itself that it will never be defeated; it will  never

lose.  Therefore, why should the Government be afraid of letting the  Opposition

Parties  carry out canvassing, put up posters, placards and cartoons in  various

parts  of  the  island  to  criticise  the Government?  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

introduction of this kind of provision by the Government enables us to see  more

clearly  that it will not allow the people to say no to its Merger  White  Paper

and to show their protest. The Government will also not allow the people to cast

blank  votes as a form of protest against it. Therefore, there remains only  one

form,  that  is,  the  general  use  of  posters  and  placards  to  show  their

dissatisfaction and protest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must know that this form of showing protest by displaying placards and

posters  is a peaceful way of showing our feelings. But the Government wants  to

prohibit even this peaceful way of showing the anger of the people. What is  the

motive  of the Government? By so doing the Government would only make  us  query

why it wants to have the establishment of another infantry regiment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am of the opinion that this kind of measure by the Government would not encourage the Opposition Parties to abide peacefully by

constitutional means of expressing their wishes. This intention on the  part  of

the Government is very vicious.



The  Government has now drafted this provision as such. If it wants  to  explain

away,  it is only because the P.A.P. today cannot get enough supporters to paste

up its own posters and placards at the various places throughout the island.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as a result of the debate on this Bill, especially On clause

41,  in  the Committee of the whole Assembly, the people of Singapore know  that

they  are  being gagged by the P.A.P. The people cannot use their  own  hand  to

write  something on the ballot paper and to show whether or not  they  accept  a

certain  proposition. Their eyes will also be blinded by this  provision.  They

cannot  use  their  eyes  to  read the views of the Opposition  Parties  on  the

question referred to in the referendum. We are of the opinion-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There is something wrong with the interpretation. The

system is out of order. (Pause) Mr Ong Chang Sam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, when the people cannot air their views, they should have  the

right  to  understand  what  they should do and how  they  should  vote  in  the

referendum by looking at posters. They have also the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 770</b></font><br><br>



right to listen and to see what the other Opposition Parties have to say on  the

question of national referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel that this amendment is very important. The Government can use the radio and the Press to air the Government's views. They can

thus  influence the electors in the coming referendum as to what they should  do

in  the  national referendum. However, the Opposition Parties do  not  have  the

right to make use of the radio or Rediffusion to make known their views to  the

people.  Under these circumstances, we, the Opposition Parties should  have  the

full  right to demand that in this National Referendum Bill we should he allowed

to  put  up  banners, posters and placards so as to enable us, in a  simple  and

concise  manner,  to  tell the people how they should  decide  in  the  national

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a little while ago I said that in the past one year the

Government  has made full use of all its propaganda machinery to  propogate  its

policies.  But we the Opposition Parties cannot do so. You will receive  that  my

Party  and  some  other trade unions have put up banners to  oppose  the  phoney

merger plan of the Government, however, every branch of my Party and other trade

unions have received notices from the Chief Building Surveyor that we must apply

for a permit before we could put up banners. It is impossible to ask us to apply

for  a permit, if my memory is correct, one square foot of the placard costs  us

about  75  cents.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not even have the  right  to  put  up

banners  and  posters. We have been deprived of this right  by  the  Government.

However, in the

P.A.P. headquarters and the commuunity centres and P.A.P. Branches  the  Government has put up banners pronagating the concept of Malaysia and merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Distortion of facts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we can see clearly that the Government has ample time to  propagate their policies and their ideas. However, we the Opposition Parties cannot

enjoy these benefits and these rights.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 771</b></font><br><br>



Another  point is in regard to the holding of mass rallies. What we can  display

is very limited in number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before a mass rally is held, we must apply to the City

Council or the Public Works Department to allow us to use the particular  places

for the rally. Only then can we apply to the police for a permit to hold

it.



<br><br>10.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will realise that places belonging to the City Council and

the  Public  Works  Department  are under the control  of  the  Government.  The

Government  can, before the National Referendum period, allot lands  and  places

like parks and parking lots for the Government to hold mass rallies. Under these

circumstances, when we apply to the City Council or the Public Works  Department

for permission to use these places, our applications are sure to be rejected  by

the  Government.  Therefore, we can say that in the coming national  referendum,

we,  the  Opposition  Parties,  will  not have  any  opportunity  to  apply  for

permission to use lands in the urban area, because these places will  have  been

allocated to the Government and we will be deprived of our right to use them.



<br><br>10.46 p.m.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>   [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, speaking about the rural areas, how does the Government control

the holding of mass rallies? It is very simple. The national referendum will  be

conducted by the Minister for Home Affairs and permits to hold mass rallies will

also have to be approved by the police who are under the control of the Minister

for  Home Affairs. Before we send in our applications, the Government can notify

the  police stations in advance that the Government wishes to hold mass  rallies

at  certain  places, in the rural areas especially, there is limited  space  for

holding such rallies in a central position. If we Opposition Parties send in our

applications, I am sure, Mr Mammen, that our applications will be  rejected  by

the authorities concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 772</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, you can see very clearly that the P.A.P. Government can make

use of all the advantageous conditions, but, on the other hand, they deprive  us

of the right to hold mass rallies. Under these circumstances, we are not able to

hold mass rallies, in the same way, we cannot display our placards, banners  and

posters.  Mr  Mammen, you can see very clearly from this that the  Government's

cunning  policy is intended to deceive us. They think that we are  inexperienced

and  that  we  do not know the plot of the Government. Mr Mammen,  if  the  Govermnent  are trying to restrict the Opposition Parties from putting  up  banners

and  posters  during the national referendum period, it is clear that  they  are

trying  to  restrict  and prevent the Opposition Parties  from  conveying  their

opinions to the people under the name of democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, just now my colleague, the Member for Upper Serangoon, has

said  that  the question of merger has been debated for nearly a year,  but  the

Government has completely distorted our stand on the question of merger and  our

views  on  the question of merger. Next week we shall debate a motion tabled  by

the Prime Minister. From this you will see very clearly that the Government have

completely distorted our stand. Therefore, we the Opposition Parties have  every

reason  to demand that during the national referendum period we should have  all

facilities, the minimum requirement for carrying out our propaganda  work,  such

as  putting  up  banners,  posters and placards. If  the  Government  are  fully

confident,  why  should they be afraid that we in the Opposition  would  put  up

posters and banners? Why do they fear us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government say that Communist subversive elements are trying to wreck the

national  referendum,  but  the  Government  Ministers,  especially  the   Prime

Minister, have said that in Singapore there are only 300 Communists. So how  can

these 300 Communists influence the people in the 51 constituencies? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we must not be blind to the undemocratic national referendum Bill. We must

not overlook this and we must not overlook the right of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 773</b></font><br><br>



people to air their views on the question of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, the amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown is based on a

provision  from  the Singapore Legislative Elections Ordinance. I  remember  the

Minister for Home Affairs, when introducing the Second Reading of the Bill, said

the  drafting  of  this  Bill  was based on the Singapore  Legislative  Assembly

Elections  Ordinance. If this Bill is based on the Elections Ordinance,  why  do

the  Government  not give the Opposition Parties the right to  put  up  posters,

banners  and  placards and sufficient time to do so? Mr  Mammen,  Sir,  we  can

clearly see that the P.A.P. Government are now trying to use all sorts of unfair

methods  and  unfair provisions to prevent the people of Singapore  from  airing

their  views. Today the people of Singapore can very clearly understand that  in

the  coming national referendum they are forced to accept poison from the P.A.P.

They  will  not  be able to express their dissatisfaction and their  views.  Mr

Mammen, Sir, I feel that since the Government, from the provisions of this Bill,

will  be  enjoying all sorts of facilities, our minimum demand is  that  in  the

coming  national  referendum they should give us ample time to put  up  banners,

placards  and  posters;  otherwise it will only  go  to  show  that  the  P.A.P.

Government are not sincere and honest but are dictatorial on the question of the

national referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Actually, Mr

Mammen, what difference does it make whether or not we can freely have political

propaganda  during the period of the referendum? As I have said, the  result  of

the  coming  merger referendum is a foregone conclusion and we can  predict  the

Government  is  going to win over 90 per cent hands down. But, Mr  Mammen,  the

difference  is  this. If the Government would be more democratic,  we  would  be

able,  in  the  course of the referendum campaign, to expose  the  shameful  and

artful manipulations of the Government in this sham referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The campaign

started six months ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Mammen,

clause  41  as put up by the Government is to restrict the referendum propaganda

campaign to only referendum meetings. Other than referendum meetings, we  cannot

display  symbols,  banners  and  flags. We are  also  worried  that  during  the

referendum  meetings, the Government will also impose restrictions  on  us,  the

Opposition  Parties. Mr Mammen, we are applying for a permit  to  hold  a  mass

rally  on  the 15th of July, two weeks from now, and we have been  told  by  the

police  that  we  must submit, for instance, our list of speakers,  the  subject

matter, how many loudspeakers we are going to use - 4, 12, 100 or 200

- how many lorries, what we are going to put as our platform; and we have to send

our  banners to the police station to be chopped, signed and sealed.  There  are

also many other restrictions.



<br><br>11.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, these are unfair restrictions. We are not given the right to go to Hong Lim Park under the excuse of the City Council Park Rules, which do not say

that  nobody cannot use the Park except during by-election time. We  are  afraid

that  these  restrictions will also be exercised by the Government  and  thereby

restrict Opposition Parties from exposing the sham referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, we know the result. It is a foregone conclusion. But we want to use

every opportunity we can to expose this sham referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, the main intention of the amendment introduced by the

Minister  for  Home Affairs is to restrict canvassing during the period  of  the

referendum. Now everybody is aware and it is an open secret that the  Government

is  trying to suppress Press reports. Its means of suppressing these reports are

rather  subtle,  and I believe the Member for Anson explained it yesterday.  The

Government has given an order to the Press that they could only publish  30  per

cent  of the views of the Opposition Parties, and that this is true can be  seen

from reading this morning's newspapers. In this morning's Sin Chew Jit Poh.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order. The Press reports which the Member is going

to  quote no doubt have been drawn from the debate here in this Assembly, and by

quoting  them he is merely repeating them. However, I cannot understand how  all

that has any relevance to the amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Mammen,  I have to point it out because it is connected with the  political

propaganda  which  the  Government is suppressing, a  suppression  to  stop  the

Opposition Parties from opening their mouths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this: at one time when the Opposition Parties wanted to hold

mass  rallies  to raise the standard of political education of the people, they

suffered suppression. This suppression is, however, more severe than that during

the Lim Yew Hock Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the P.A.P. Government today can be regarded by the

people  and,  in  fact,  the people of Malaysia, as a Party  that  distorts  the

political  stand  of the Opposition Parties. The Government  has  distorted  our

stand on merger by saying that we want the Penang/Malacca type of merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I suggest

to  the Member that perhaps all these details may be brought up when we come  to

discuss  the motion standing in the names of the Member for Queenstown  and  the

Member for Upper Serangoon?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Mammen, I just want to give an example to prove that the P.A.P.  Government

is capable of distorting the stand of the Opposition Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is that on the issue of merger, the P.A.P. have used words and

terms of ambiguity. For instance, the P.A.P. always say that the term "national"

is  the same and equivalent to "citizen". You cannot find such an explanation in

any dictionary. They also talk about autonomy in education and, labour which  we

know is useless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 776</b></font><br><br>



without internal security, it is only a psychological way to cheat the people by

the use of such terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are resorting to all kinds of means to attack the Opposition

Parties.  They  are  exerting their utmost to carry out their  schemes,  through

their  use  of the radio, the Press, etc. The Ministry of Culture has also  been

made  use  of  to spread their party propaganda at the expense of public  funds.

That is the fifth point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these points that I have mentioned, you can see that during the period of

the national referendum, political Parties of the Opposition are prohibited from

campaigning  and giving publicity to their stand. This restriction is  therefore

advantageous  to  the  Government. But something more regrettable  is  that  the

P.A.P.,  since  their inception, have always been boasting about  educating  the

people  and  raising their political consciousness. But today we  see  that  the

P.A.P. want to stop people from carrying out political education and  political

campaigns to educate and to raise the political consciousness of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this we can clearly see that the P.A.P., as a political Party, has lost

what  it stood for. Today I say that the Ministers sitting opposite are the ones

who fear the people most. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, Sir, if the Minister for Home Affairs wants to challenge me, I will

at  any time accept his challenge. But I believe that the P.A.P. do not have the

guts to challenge me. If they have any guts to face the people, then let us  ask

how  many  mass rallies have they conducted on this important issue?  They  have

been  hiding behind radio forums and dare not face the people to explain to them

their political stand on current issues of importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, if the P.A.P. is confident of its own White Paper, that it is in the interests of the people, and that it is the best obtainable in the world,

then everybody will ask this:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 777</b></font><br><br>



why  is  the Government afraid of allowing the Opposition Parties to  carry  out

their  political campaign during the period of the referendum? If the Government

insist on prohibiting political campaigns during the referendum, we can only say

that  the  P.A.P. is crying out "thieves" when, in actual fact,  they  are  the

thieves. Why are they afraid of the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has said that if the White Paper merger of the

P.A.P. is good, then-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot understand how all these arguments fit in with

the   amendment  moved  by  the  Member  for  Queenstown.  They  are  completely

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Why  is  the  P.A.P. afraid to let the Opposition Parties carry out a  political

campaign during the period of the national referendum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying just now that the Member for Bras Basah said that when she was a

member  of  the Central Executive Committee of the P.A.P., she was not consulted

at all on the merger issue-



<br><br>11.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This is completely irrelevant to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

This  amendment is to enable the political Parties to give their  views  and  explain  their  stand on the various issues concerning merger so that  the  people

will  he able to decide whether or not their stand is correct and whether  it  is

acceptable to them. If the P.A.P.'s White Paper proposals on merger are fair and

above-board,  why should the P.A.P. be afraid to let the people  know  the  true

facts? We can see from this that there must be something secret behind the whole

thing which cannot be told to others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, we regret very much that as members of a political Party they

should be afraid of a political campaign and political education.

compare us with a Party that we all know is a rotten Party. He now very strongly

criticises the Government that there has been Press intimidation. When the  hon.

Member and his colleagues were sitting on that side of the House two and a  half

years  ago,  we stood up in this House and criticised and accused the Government

of suggested intimidation of the Press. But all the Barisan Sosialis Members who

were then sitting there were laughing, giggling and enjoying themselves with the

P.A.P. They are now having a dose of the medicine that they gave to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis Members took about 90 minutes of the time of this

House  to say nothing except repeat, repeat and repeat. They have lost sight  of

what  they are fighting for. They have charged that they would not be given  the

opportunity  to go out and distort as much as they would like to distort.  There

is  nothing  in this proposed amendment moved by the Minister to  say  that  the

Barisan  Members  cannot go out and talk to their hearts' content.  If,  in  all

their attacks against the P.A.P., they could say that at least the Lim Yew  Hock

Government  was  not so bad, I might feel a bit delighted.  What  they  are  not

allowed  to  carry is this. They will not be allowed to carry flags, banners  or

placards  when  they  go out canvassing. They can go out  and  distribute  their

literature to the households, and they can talk as much as they want.  They  can

carry their symbol, that is, their star

- their  new star that was born during a bad time. They can use their  own  Party

symbol. They can carry their Party flag. But what they are not allowed to do  is

to  carry a big banner and placards and what not. I do not know what restriction

there  is.  As far as I know, there hive been elections ever since 1948,  and  I

have  not  seen  P.A.P. canvassers going round the  houses  carrying  placards,

banners and flags. That has never been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 779</b></font><br><br>



done.  Perhaps the Barisan is thinking of carrying banners and flags. What  for?

They  could  go  to the houses and talk to the voters as much as they  like.  In

fact, they have already done it. They can canvass as much as they want. They can

go  and distribute their literature. There is nothing to prevent them from doing

that. They can distribute pamphlets and anything they want. The only thing  they

are  asked  not to do is to carry banners, placards and flags. If they  want  to

carry a little flag showing their star, no one is going to prevent them. So  why

must  they  waste  the  time of this Assembly by talking  on  irrelevancies  and

fighting for something which no one wants? No canvasser has ever gone to  houses

carrying  flags, banners and placards. That has never been done.  Why  do  they

want  to  do it now? I think I can understand why. The more they talk, the  more

they try to present their case, the more they try to object to things which  are

not  objectionable, the more they are making the people of Singapore come to the

realisation that the Barisan Sosialis is out to wreck merger; and the sooner the

people  of Singapore come to that realisation, the better it will be for all  of

us, for our peace, happiness and our prosperity.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I will be very brief, Mr Mammen. I myself cannot understand, I

must  confess,  the heat which has been caused by this particular  part  of  the

provisions of the Bill. I would ask the Minister for Home Affairs this. He seems

to  be generally of the view that party banners and party symbols can be carried

during  the  period  of the referendum. I would urge him to look  again  at  the

clause  which speaks of all symbols, sets of colour, flags, banners or  placards

which  are  political propaganda, Sir, not referendum propaganda.  No  political

propaganda  may be utilised. None of this, how shall I say it, visual propaganda

may  be utilised during the referendum period. It does not refer exclusively  to

referendum propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I would urge him to note is this. I cannot see, and I would

like  to  understand - it  may  well be that I have  missed  that  aspect  of  the

Minister's explanation - what really is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 780</b></font><br><br>

objection  to the use of colours, symbols, banners, placards as referenda  propaganda?  He has not given any explanation. I myself must say this, Mr Mammen.  I

have not got in mind the use of these articles myself, and it may well be that I

will  be  learning something! But I cannot see what this provision is aimed  at.

That the Barisan is rather touthy is understandable, Sir, in the context of  the

conduct of the Government today, and in recent times in preventing, for example,

rallies  at  which  it  has been sought to explain the Referendum  Bill  to  the

people.  You are no doubt fully aware, as are most citizens of Singapore,  of  a

legitimate  group of political Parties, through a Liaison Committee,  which  has

somewhat  the  grand  title  of  the Council of Joint  Action,  but  it  is  not

particularly a title of which I am proud. It is a Liaison Committee nevertheless

of  perfectly  legitimate and honest political Parties  which  has  sought,  and

rightly sought to obtain from the Government permission for the holding of  mass

rallies to explain the dangers to which the people are about to be subjected  in

respect  of this referendum with its reference to the merger. And you know,  Mr

Mammen,  that the political Parties concerned have been refused permits for  the

holding of these rallies. In that context-



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen,

I just want to clarify the point raised by the Member for Anson, namely, that we

have been refusing a group of political Parties to hold rallies. The explanation

is quite simple. In the case of Fullerton Square, the place there-



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> - is only used for election meetings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> For P.A.P. meetings!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> For election

meetings. The Member for Queenstown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 781</b></font><br><br>

applied once in the name of the Barisan Sosialis and it was turned down on that

ground. Similarly, Mrs Leon-Soh, on behalf of the Singapore Congress -

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> K.U.R.A.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> -last year also applied for the use of the place, but it was

also  turned down because it was not an election meeting as it was not  election

time.  Now  in  the  case of Colombo Court, which was to be the  venue  for  the

meeting  of  this  group of political Parties, the explanation  there  is  quite

simple.  If you will remember, there is the Minor Offences Legislative  Assembly

Order,  1961, which has laid down that no public assembly should be held in  any

public place within the precincts of the Assembly when it is in session. You are

aware  that  the Assembly will still be sitting tomorrow, and therefore  Colombo

Court cannot be allowed. In the case of the proposed meeting at Dhoby Ghaut, the

application  was  not  pursued.  It is not that  the  police  refused  it.  The

application was not pursued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They gave up!

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged to the Minister, Sir, I would ask him whether, in

fact,  we  are to understand that if a request is made for Colombo Court  for  a

Saturday or a Sunday it would be granted. Do I understand that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The Barisan Sosialis have held no less than three meetings

at that spot. I do not need to elaborate further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Only two.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged, Mr Mammen. It seems to me the P.A.P. are rather

touchy  about Fullerton Square. They say it is reserved for election  meetings.

I do not know what law specially reserves it -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): I

think  that point has been cleared by the Minister. If the Member for  Anson  is

going  into details, he is inviting a debate on that. If he skips that part  and

go on with the amendment, it will be better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged, Mr

Mammen



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Dhoby Ghaut

has not been mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is fair enough.

We  have, I think, made the point, Sir, that rejections of applications  without

adequate  explanation have rather disturbed the Opposition Parties who  are  now

conditioned to expecting the very worst from the P.A.P. It is in that light that

I  seek  to  understand  the arguments urged by the  Barisan  Sosialis  to  the

amendment of the Minister. I really would like to hear from him if he will  find

time as soon as I sit down, and that will be very soon, Sir, to let us know what

is the main objection to the utilisation of these articles during the referendum

period.



<br><br>11.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Why does the Government want to impose such severe restrictions

in the Referendum Bill with regard to the use of placards and banners? From this

we can see that there is something important regarding the placards, banners and

flags. We can also see that the P.A.P. Government is not democratic. It has come

to  the  stage of dictatorship. Now I will describe how undemocratic  it  is.  I

remember  that  in  the  past,  the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  was  also  very

undemocratic.  They  adopted the same methods during  the  general  election  to

restrict the use of banners and flags.



<br><br>11.32 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put forward my views to the

P.A.P. leadership  and  they  remarked, "Oh, the  Government  is  undemocratic,

otherwise we can put up our placards, banners and flags. So to make the best use

of  the restriction, we must put up placards and banners in noisy places,  along

the main roads, in the streets, so that this thing can be made known to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 783</b></font><br><br>



most  of the people or in a place where there are many residents." This explains

the importance of banners and flags. The

P.A.P.  Government  is  now  using  the same experience  of  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government to impose more restrictive provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you can see that the P.A.P. Government is using many Government departments, not only the Ministry of

Culture,  the radio, but also the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry  of  Home

Affairs to intimidate. They make use of the post to convey messages and views to

the  people,  but they want to restrict the Opposition from using  placards  and

banners.  The  Government enjoy such facilities as the radio and Rediffusion  to

propagate  and  paint beautiful pictures about Malaysia and  merger.  They  have

already  launched  a widespread propaganda campaign. Our position  is  different

from  that  of the Government. We on the Opposition only want to put across  our

views  to  the  people and let them consider and make up their  own  minds.  The

Government  postcard says how beautiful and how good merger is, but  we  on  our

side have to show to the people how ugly and distasteful it is. For instance,  a

Government  placard  or  slogan  may  enthusiastically  support  the  merger  of

Singapore with the Federation. Now this placard of the Government appears to  be

very pleasant, but to us, it is only a means of cheating the people. We have  to

put  up  another slogan to counter such a Government action. We have to make  it

known that this is a phoney merger and

we  have  to  counter it. The people can make their own decision  on  these  two

conflicting views. In the past, we talked about merger and the reunification  of

the two countries. We have already done this and left a very deep impression  in

the  minds of the people. Now the people may ask why is it that in the past, the

Opposition Parties used to give them reasons as to why they were against merger,

but  have not done the same thing now? The Government on their part can make use

of  the  Ministry  of Culture and other machinery to paste posters  and  banners

everywhere. When



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 784</b></font><br><br>



the people look at them, they may feel disgusted and want the Opposition Parties

also  to  put up posters and other things to explain to them their views.  I  am

only  trying  to  explain  this  to show that  the  Government  should  let  the

Opposition  Parties carry out their publicity work because there is great  merit

in  political  publicity,  e.g.,  educating the people  and  infusing  political

consciousness in them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about banners and the like. I am of the opinion that during

the  national referendum period, people should be allowed to put up banners  and

such things. Let me give an example. The P.A.P. Government asks their members to

go out and do publicity work to sell their merger plan to the people. But if the

people are not agreeable to these proposals, they may turn away when the

P.A.P. members come with banners and

such  things.  They may be very confusing to the people who may doubt  their  intentions.  When  faced with such a situation, the people may sometimes  feel  it

unpleasant  to  rebut, or show their disgust to such people. So  an  opportunity

should  be given to the political Parties to put up their banners, placards  and

other  things to express their views on merger and Malaysia, that is to say,  to

give a fair chance to all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Member for Queenstown alleged a few minutes ago that the Government has

not  kept  its promise to the Opposition regarding its intention of what  to  do

with  this  clause  which was postponed in the Select Committee.  I  think,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this allegation is very far from the truth. I  remember  that - unfortunately I have not got a copy of the letter with me - letters stating the  Government's  intention to the various points raised in the Select Committee,  were

sent  to  all  the  Opposition Members as promised, a week before  the  Assembly

meeting. I remember that in the Select Committee I only promised to indicate the

Government's intention to the Opposition Members. I do not remember that I  ever

said that we would send the exact amendment of the clause to Opposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 785</b></font><br><br>



Members.  But  far  from  the Government breaking its promise,  the  Member  for

Queenstown  raised  the amendment long before he received the  letter  from  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we heard a few moments ago a ridiculous

suggestion  from the Member for Queenstown that he wanted an opportunity  to  be

able to carry banners and placards into the houses of electors to do canvassing.

This  is the most ridiculous suggestion I have ever heard of. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

if  you  know  how canvassing takes place during the election, you will  realise

that  in  canvassing, only literature - election pamphlets, election manifestoes,

the candidate's history - and pictures of the candidate are used, never banners.



<br><br>11.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said on the Second Reading of the Bill that canvassing would be allowed

during  the referendum as in the case of an election when canvassing is  allowed

except  on polling day. And in the course of canvassing, the canvasser  can  distribute  whatever literature he wants to distribute. There is no prohibition  on

that.  It  is true that posters will be totally prohibited during the referendum

period.  But, as I have pointed out earlier, if we allow posters to be displayed

by  political Parties during the referendum period, then whatever posters put up

by  the  Superintendent  which  are factual and  instructional  will  be  either

completely blotted out or confused. As I said, this will be the first referendum

that  the  State  is  conducting, and it is necessary  that  such  instructional

posters  put  up by the Superintendent should receive the prominence  that  they

deserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the allegation made by the Member for Choa Chu Kang that banners put up

by  the Barisan Sosialis and the S.A.T.U. group of trade unions are not allowed,

the  simple reason is that under normal circumstances, before one can display  a

banner or poster, a permit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 786</b></font><br><br>



is  necessary from the Ministry of National Development. This the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the S.A.T.U. group of unions obviously did not intend to do. And  even

when  notices  of warning were served on the Barisan Sosialis and  the  S.A.T.U.

unions,  the notices were ignored and flouted. They had no intention of  obeying

any rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the allegation that

P.A.P. banners were left without interference from the Government. I just  want

to  inform the Member for Choa Chu Kang - in case he is still ignorant of the fact

-  that all the banners put up by the P.A.P. at the P.A.P. branch premises  were

taken  from the Ministry of Culture. These were Ministry of Culture banners  and

posters.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They are P.A.P.

banners.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Of the P.A.P.



branches.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> And the significant point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that

whenever we display banners and posters produced by the Ministry of Culture, you

will  find  these  articles either disappear overnight or torn  down  overnight;

whereas  the  banners put up by the Barisan Sosialis and the S.A.T.U. group  of

trade unions are left intact even until today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the allegation that various obstacles were placed before the

Barisan Sosialis in their applications for permits to hold mass meetings, I must

inform  the Member for Choa Chu Kang that similar rules and procedures apply  to

all political Parties, including the P.A.P. We always make it a point to observe

these  rules, and when the Barisan Sosialis were on this side of the House  they

went  through  all these procedures in their applications for  permits  to  hold

meetings,  and  if they still have a conscience, they will have  to  admit  this

fact.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we have an admission from the horse's mouth - that

there is Party use of Government money for Party propaganda.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 787</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hooray!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> A clear admission



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Twister!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He says the Party, through the Ministry of Culture, is

using Government money in order to put up Party propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There has been gross misrepresentation. I think the

Minister must be allowed to correct the misrepresentation. Mr Ong Pang Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that  was, as you said, gross misrepresentation. This is Government  propaganda. It is not party propaganda. In fact, if the Barisan Sosialis are prepared

to assist the Government to publicise whatever the Government wish to publicise,

they  are welcome to all these propaganda materials produced by the Ministry  of

Culture. In fact, if they are patriots and they really have the interest of  the

country  and the nation at heart, they should assist the Government to publicise

the concept of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is because

we  are  conscious of our duty to the people of Singapore that we ask  that  the

people  be given the other side of the picture. So far the Government have  been

giving distorted versions of the plan on Malaysia and merger to the people.  For

example,  Sir - i can come to this later on - I asked a question from the  Minister

whether  parks  and  open  spaces would be allowed for referendum  meetings.  No

answer  has come from him. I would rather wait for an answer before I  continue.

And if he could give an answer now, would he enlighten us?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Minister accepting the

invitation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 788</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes, Mr

Speaker, Sir. As in an election, parks and playgrounds can be used and  will  be

used.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And in Fullerton Square?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, now I have got it from the Minister. He says, "As in

general  elections, parks and open playgrounds will be allowed". Let  me  remind

the  Minister now that in a general election, three months ahead, the people and

the political Parties are allowed to make use of these playgrounds and parks. We

know  the  Government intend to hold this referendum very soon. Why do they  not

allow  us  now to make use of these parks and open spaces? Why? Can the Minister

give an answer? I am ready to wait, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Please continue. It is now seven minutes to twelve.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> See the distortion, Sir. The way they say one thing and

mean another.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> You have said you will wait.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b>

Then wait.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They say "as in a general election". All right, we accept

that. Yet we are restricted in every way. In other words, the Government all the

time are just spouting out falsehoods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the explanation given by the Minister for Home Affairs is that if the

Opposition  should be allowed posters, then the people would be confused.  I  do

not  know how they can ever think of such a silly excuse. It simply will not  go

down.  If  you  want to invent an excuse, at least go back to  the  Ministry  of

Culture and ask them to give you a better one. At least say something which  the

people can accept. Just because we put up posters, therefore the people will  be

confused? In fact, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 789</b></font><br><br>



I  am  going to suggest that it is because the P.A.P. keep on giving  their  own

version  on  posters that the people are confused. Look at what is happening  to

this so-called Penang type of merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Barisan type.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Everyday they

have  been  spouting out this Penang type of merger over Radio Singapore,  Radio

P.A.P., Rediffusion [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a nice chorus coming from the Government Benches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All the time they are trying to convince the people that

"national" is the same as "citizen". [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown, I think, is now acting like an

orchestra   leader!  If  he  looks  at  the  Government  Benches   and   accepts

interjections and then waits for further interjections, then of course  we  will

have a midnight chorus!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we ask for

canvassing and not without reason. Banners at the present moment [Interruption]-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, our Party branches put up certain banners, and the

P.A.P., through the Ministers, asked the National Development -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Chief Surveyor's Department.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the Chief Surveyor's Department to serve notices on our

branches saying that because we put up the banners -

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> You had no permits.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose it is the late hour. I think the Member for Queenstown

is  going  much  too  far away from this amendment. This  question  of  banners,

permits, and so on, does not arise at the moment. We are now on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 790</b></font><br><br>



question  whether or not there should be this propaganda during  the  period  of

referendum. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, in

canvassing we do not carry banners around. Quite true. But sometimes  there  may

be  occasions  where banners are very useful. Why must the P.A.P. say  that  we

cannot  carry  banners around? If we in the Barisan Sosialis think that  banners

will serve a useful purpose, why are they denying us that right?

Is it because the P.A.P. cannot do it

themselves? Because they have no organisation? Because there is nobody  to  help

them? Why must they deny us a right which we claim, and which we know should  be

given?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, all these amendments have been put in with a view to restricting

our  means of communication with the masses. The Government have all along  been

saying  that  we are isolated, that we have lost the support of the people,  and

yet  they go on trying to restrict our activities because they fear that we can,

according to them, "confuse" the people. No, Sir, we do not confuse the  people.

We  want to tell the people the truth. And it is because the people know that we

are telling the truth-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The tooth and nothing but the tooth!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - that there is hardly any support left for the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> A good contribution from the Deputy Prime Minister. He has just

walked in, and contributes one sentence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know,

Sir,  whether the Deputy Prime Minister, once a physiologist, has now  become  a

dentist.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> A what? A dentist?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not mind

a  Member  rising  on  a point of order if it is only to stop  the  Member  from

speaking. There are only two minutes more. Dr Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the P.A.P.

have  all along been telling us that in the future referendum there will be  two

questions.  And they have also been telling the people that these two  questions

will  be based on the stand of the P.A.P. as well as on the stand of the Barisan

Sosialis.  Therefore,  as was pointed out to you by the  Member  for  Upper  Serangoon, it looks as if it is going to be a Party to Party fight instead of a referendum on a really national issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We do not mind making it a Party to Party fight, Sir, at

any  time. In fact, we have challenged them. If only they dare to go back to the

people.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. All that is irrelevant, and it is midnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of

the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have to report that the Committee has made progress on the Bill, and ask

leave to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That this Assembly do now adjourn."-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>

<div align="right">Twelve o'clock midnight.</div>
