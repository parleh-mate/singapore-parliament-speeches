payment  of $1,080 before it would agree to connect

up  the  supply.  It is estimated that  the  actual

consumption  would be only $300  a  month  and  the

Department  had  been trying to persuade  the  City

Council  to modify its demand, but without success.

To  avoid  further inconvenience, it  was  recently

decided to accept the City Council's terms.

<div align="center"><b>STATEMENTS BY THE CHIEF MINISTER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Singapore Riots/Merdeka Talks)</b></div>



<br><br>10.04 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the recent riots are still uppermost

in  our minds. These have been extensively reported

in  the  Press  and  hon. Members  are  already  in

possession  of most of the facts. I would  like  to

give  a  clear picture so that hon. Members can  be

fully informed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on my amendment to the motion of the

Member for  Tanjong Pagar at the last  sitting  of

this Assembly, I said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...some people have quite rightly asked me why

the  Government should have found it  necessary  to

take  this action when there is apparent peace  and

quiet  in  Singapore.  May I  add,  Sir,  that  the Government  has channels of information  which  are

not normally at the disposal of the general public?

They  are not aware that this is a dangerous quiet.

They are not aware that there has been a change  in

Communist   strategy.  There  has  been   intensive

penetration into a wide field of otherwise laudable

activities  which is building up a  position  of  a

powerful  force that threatens the whole future  of

democratic  government. The aim is to  control  the

masses  through  united front, of  workers  through

trade unions, of youth through students' unions, of

peasants  through farmers' associations and  attap-

dwellers'   associations, of  the   intelligentsia

through    teachers,    literary    and    cultural

organisations,   of  women  through   the   women's

federation, and of political Parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was confronted with this growing

menace when it took office last June, but no action

was  taken because we were biding our time and were

gathering  more  and more news intelligence  before

launching on our campaign."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my amendment had the overwhelming support of

this House which

was given in answer to my call which was contained

in the following words:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I move my amendment in the fullest confidence

that  it  will  receive the  full  support  of  all

Members  who  sincerely  believe  in  and  practise

democracy.  This Government does not care  to  have

the  support of those who claim to love  Singapore,

to  owe  loyalty to Singapore, and  yet  are  doing

their  very best to destroy the security and  well-being  of  the people of Singapore. This Government

does  not care to have the support of such  people.

It   is   better  that  such  Assemblymen   declare

themselves  here  and now so  that  the  people  of

Singapore can know them for what they are  and  not

what they pretend to be."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five Members, Sir, have so declared themselves and

the air in this House is the better for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent events have since proved the justification

and  wisdom  of the Government's action  which  has

brought  to  light the evil planning of  subversive

elements  that  has been going on  to  build  up  a

powerful force to overthrow democratic government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the commencement of the Government's action

on  the  18th September to the 24th October, before

the  riots  took  place, 15 persons  were  arrested

under the Banishment Ordinance and the Preservation

of  Public Security Ordinance, and seven Communist-front   organisations  were  dissolved  under   the

Societies  Ordinance. This action was  striking  at

the  root  of  the evil forces. The Government  was

gradually but inexorably winning the fight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24th September the Singapore Chinese Middle

Schools'  Students'  Union was  dissolved  and  the

Government  exposed  the subversive  activities  of

this  Union in a White Paper which was laid  before

the  Assembly last month. On 1st October  Soon  Loh

Boon,  ex-President  of the  dissolved  Union,  was

arrested  and this was followed on 10th October  by

the  arrests  of  four more Chinese  Middle  School

student  leaders  and  the Minister  for  Education

required  the  Committees  of  Management  of   the

Chinese  High School and the Chung Cheng School  to

expel  142 students whose activities in the schools

have  been of a subversive character. On the nights

of 10th and 11th October, large numbers of students

congregated in these two schools to commence a stay-in  demonstration of defiance. On 12th October,  at

the  request  of  the Minister for  Education,  the

Committees  of Management declared that  these  two

schools  were  temporarily closed. On 13th  October

the Ministry of Education commenced re-registration

of Chinese Middle School students for two temporary

schools  to  be run by the Government.  These  were

subsequently opened on 16th October.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime several Middle Road organisations

were  becoming  increasingly  active  in  providing

financial, material and moral support to the  stay-in  students. Of special mention, the Singapore Bus

Workers Union arranged comfort visits by parties of

over   600  to  the  Chinese  High  School  stay-in

students  on  20th October, and 300  to  the  Chung

Cheng  School  on 24th October, this  action  being

complementary  in  nature to  the  similar  comfort

visits  paid  by  Student  Union  members  to   the

striking bus workers immediately prior to the Hock

Lee riots in May 1955.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mornings of 22nd and 23rd October large

groups  of  students, who were believed to have  come

from  the two stay-in schools, picketed other Chinese

Middle  Schools in order to enforce a general  strike

of   Middle  School  students  throughout  Singapore.

Banners were exhibited which read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A long term suspension of classes as a protest

against  the  Government's  insincere  reply  to  our

demand".

<br><br>At  the  same  time, there had been many  reports  of

veiled   intimidation  to  prevent   the   successful

development of the two temporary Government schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government had been patient and tolerant so far

and  this  had been taken by the student leaders  and

leaders  of  the  Middle  Road  bloc  as  a  sign  of

weakness, which accounted for their increasing  tempo

of  defiance of constituted authority. Something  had

to be done, and

done  quickly,  to  prevent such illegal  activities

getting  out  of  hand and the Council  of  Ministers

therefore  decided  on 23rd  October  to  take  firm

action  to  clear the two schools. On the evening  of

24th October, in a broadcast over Radio Malaya, I said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The events of the past few days have brought to a

head  the  situation in our Singapore middle schools.

And  it is not a problem of education; it is a matter

of  discipline  in the schools, of authority  in  the

family,  and  respect  for  the  legally  constituted

Government of Singapore. No community can allow  this

persistent  defiant and aggressive in  discipline  to

continue   among   its   element   in   its   younger

generation. Theirs is not a threat to any  particular

government; it is a threat to all governments of  any

kind.  If,  in the name of democracy, any  group  can

hold  the  Government to ransom until it  gets  everything  it  wants, Government becomes  a  mere  rubber

stamp,  and  those who are the most  defiant  of  the

law,   those  who  shout  loudest  and  bully   most

threateningly and persistently, will get  their  way.

This is the anteroom to mob rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student leaders have not only defied the school

authorities in the schools, they have organised a

campaign of misrepresentation outside the schools.

They have kept students in the schools to prevent

their being reopened and to prevent the students

there from getting any proper education, even at the

sacrifice of their opportunities of sitting their

examinations. They have mobilised the parents, some

of whom have been glad to join in a political

campaign under the guise of supporting Chinese

education, and some genuinely misted by the

students. They have taken to the homes the campaign

against the new schools opened by Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



The two schools have therefore become a focus of

organized resistance to Government policy. Parents

are urging  Government to clear the situation in

order that their boys and girls should be able to

carry on their studies peacefully, and not to be

made the pawns in a political campaign at their

expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided that we do not want the schools to

be permanently infected with this fever, and carry

the fever into the whole community. We want to

restore the normal healthy temperature particularly

in the schools where the fever can do most damage

now, and even greater damage in the future when these

students are the bread-winners, the citizens and the

parents of tomorrow. For this reason, the Minister

for Education has therefore today sent a leter to

every parent of the two schools to bring them home

before 8 p.m. Thursday, 25th October. For the

Government has decided that the schools must be

cleared, that they must cease to be schools of

indiscipline in the name of Chinese culture,and becoming real schools of peaceful Chinese Culture playing their part in building the democratic self-governing

Singapore of which we are on the threshold."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time (the morning of 23rd October) the

People's Action Party had held three protest

meetings, the Farmers' Association had held eight

protest meetings,and the Civil Rights Convention Committee had held one protest meeting.Although some of the speeches made were virulent in tone, these organisations were saying in their speeches that the protests should be carried out by constitutional means; and the attendances and reception had not so far been such as to give rise to any fear of a

breach of the peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, 23rd October, further speeches were

made at the Civil Rights Convention Committee meeing

at the 11½  milestone Yio Chu Kang Road, which were

of a more inflammatory nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of 25th October, parents and

guardians began to arrive at the two stay-in schools

and the police removed barricades in order to enable

them to collect their sons, daughters or wards.

Among those who entered were officials of the

Chinese Schools' Students' Parents Friendly

Association who were sympathetic towards the stay-in

students and who aided with them in preventing other

parents from taking their sons, daughters and wards

away. The stay-in students had their own public

address



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



system  through  which they constantly  whipped  up

their own morale, and they denied a hearing to  any

statements  made over the Public Relations  address

vans by singing or clapping in unison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 5 p.m. the P.A.P. held a protest meeting at the

Beauty   World,  Bukit  Timah,  at  which   further

speeches  of  an inflammatory nature were  made  by

Lim  Ching  Siong and others, and it  is  believed

that on the conclusion of this meeting at 7 p.m., a

number  of those who had attended went to join  the

crowds  assembled in Bukit Timah Road  outside  the

Chinese High School.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parallel between the build-up at this stage

and  the  events  of  April/May 1955  was  becoming

increasingly apparent. On 24th October, 13 days had

elapsed    since    the    assemblies,    meetings,

inflammatory  speeches  and  visits  of  supporting

delegations of students and workers (including  the

bus workers) had been allowed to continue unchecked

at  the  Chinese  High School and the  Chung  Cheng

School  where  the stay-in students were  encamped,

and it became clear that if a final appeal made  to

the  parents of school children assembled at  these

two  schools  to remove them failed,  it  would  be

necessary that these assemblies be dispersed before

the  same pattern of events, as in 1955, culminated

in serious riots and disorders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the situation, Sir, when the first riot

incidents developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to take up the time of hon.

Members  by giving a detailed account of  the  riot

incidents,  as these have already been reported  in

the Press. I would like, however, to draw attention

to some of the important features.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premises of the Singapore Factory and Shop

Workers'  Union  at Middle Road,  Hongkong  Street,

Bukit Timah Road and Bukit Panjang were raided  and

several persons found therein arrested, among  whom

was  the  Member for Bukit Timah. The documents  we

have  found in the premises only confirm how  right

we  were in our decision to act in defence  of  the

peace  and security of the men, women and  children

of  all  races and classes in Singapore. They  were

planning further demonstrations in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



defiance of the law; and their documents are  full

of  sentiments of the struggle. In one document  is

the   opinion  that  the  period  of  peaceful  and

negative struggle is over and if this time they  do

not   show  their  strength  for  struggle,   their

followers  will be downhearted. This is what  calls

itself  a  trade union, and not in support  of  any

industrial  dispute  or  any  improvement  of   the

conditions  of  the working people  for  whom  they

claim

to   exist.   It  is  a  pure  political   militant

organisation dedicated to, and organised  for,  and

emotionally attuned to struggle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death in struggle is glorious", says another

document. Says yet another, "We now understand that

today  we  have to adopt a more violent  struggle."

And  finally, another says, "If we dare not  fight,

then  we  will be the losers." Is this the language

of  genuine trade unionism; or is this the language

of  a group of leaders of political subversion  who

are  deceiving the workers and the public and using

the  difficulties  of  the working  people  not  as

something  to  be  improved, but  something  to  be

exploited and magnified and manipulated  as  an  instrument  to undermine Government so that they  can

achieve  power?  Can  this exploitation  of   the

working man for selfish ends go further? In  taking

action  against  these so-called  leaders,  we  are

acting to save trade unions and trade unionism from

exploitation. We seek, as we seek in the  schools,

to  let them return to their basic purpose so  that

it   can  be  more  quickly  and  more  effectively

achieved  in  the interests of workers  and  pupils

alike.  Communist exploitation of the  workers,  as

shown  in  these tactics, is as bad  as  capitalist

exploitation  and we, as a Labour  Front  Coalition

Government, stand against both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported, Sir, in the Press, it is evident

that  the  students had been preparing  for  a  big

victory march.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrest of the Member for Bukit Timah has caused

comment  in some quarters. They were under  the  mis-

apprehension  that  an  Assemblyman  was  free  from

arrest.  There  is  no  such privilege  and  even  a

Minister of the Government can be arrested for unlawful activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raids conducted by the police, Sir, on the

premises  of  the Singapore Factory and Shop  Workers Union  and  the arrests of the leaders found  therein

had  brought about a significant change in  the  riot

situation.  There  was  an  immediate  subsidence  of

trouble.  I  leave it to hon. Members to  draw  their

own conclusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly before the riots, the Singapore Factory and

Shop  Workers Union withdrew $120,000 which  amounted

to  80  per cent of their funds. Previous withdrawals

amounted  to only $28,000. Where this money went  and

how  it  was  spent  we have at present  no  concrete

proof,  but  in the light of recent events,  one  can

safely  surmise the use to which this  large  sum  of

money has been put.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damage to life and property was fortunately

quite  small, in spite of the violence and extent  of

the  rioting, and this is mainly due to the fine  co-ordination  between the Police and the Military  and

the   imposition  of  the  curfew.   Of   the   known

casualties,  13  were  killed,  49  warded,  and   74

treated as out-patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take this opportunity to reiterate the

thanks of this Government to the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the public for their fine co-operation and their

forbearance of the hardship suffered by them  by  the

imposition  of  a curfew which had been  forced  upon

the  Government  in  our fight  against  lawless  and

subversive elements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Federation of Malaya for their

fine  gesture  and  co-operation  by  coming  to  our

immediate   assistance  with  police  reinforcements.This   has   given  meaning  and  reality   to   the

friendship which exists between the two territories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Fire Brigade and the Ambulance service for

rendering invaluable service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the City Council workers for the efficient and

prompt  manner  in which they have cleared  the  mess

left behind by the rioters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Military for their immediate response to our

request for help when our police were clearly  likely

to be exhausted by the extent of the disorders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



Military  units were in position within a few  hours

and  this  prompt and invaluable assistance  ensured

the early restoration of order with the minimum damage to life and

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our Police Force for their admirable restraint,

high  standard  of discipline, courage  in  face  of

grave danger,

and devotion to duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the events of the past few days have been

forced on the Government and the people of Singapore

alike,  by an irresponsible group who, after playing

a  long  time  with fire, have at last  started  the

fire.  The  fact  that  they  talk  sweet  words  of

democracy  and peace and constitutional  action  and

human rights does not mask their real purpose or the

danger  of  their tactics. In taking action  against

this  group,  the  Government is not  attacking  the

rights of trade unionists or farmers or teachers  or

Chinese  education. We are liberating  them  from  a

form   of  political  exploitation  which,  like   a

parasite,  grows  on the healthy  purpose  of  these

groups,  sucks  the health from the stock  on  which

they  cling and eventually kills it. We are  engaged

in Operation Liberation from an actual threat and  a

further possibility of tyranny on this island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on all workers to co-operate with the

Government in our Operation Liberation. They  should

guard   themselves  against  so-called  trade  union

leaders  who are out to exploit them for  their  own

selfish ends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on all employers to co-operate with the

Government   in  our  Operation  Liberation.   Trade

unionism is here to stay and any attempt to  smother

it,  any  attempt  to exploit workers,  is  to  give

fertile ground for subversive elements to thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on all the people of Singapore to co-operate

with  the Government in our Operation Liberation  so

that  we  can together build a happier  and  a  more

prosperous  Singapore  for  our  children  and   our

children's children.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Merdeka Talks</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I want to tell hon. Members that the

question  of  re-opening  talks  with  the  Colonial

Office has not been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



set aside. Two months ago I had already been in touch

with  the Colonial Office informing them that I would

be  visiting London in the middle of December to  fix

an  agenda  for the talks to take place  in  February

next year. I have only a few days ago been in further

communication with the Colonial Office with  a  view

to  expediting these talks. The present indication is

that  the  Secretary of State has  a  full  programme

right up to late February. He has, however, indicated

that  he  would be pleased to see me in December,  as

previously  asked for. I am therefore not  yet  in  a

position  to name a definite date for the  resumption

of talks, but this Government has decided that if the

talks  are  successful  the new  constitution  should come  into  being  in August next year,  with  fresh

elections.  The  new constitution  should  come  into

being in August next year with fresh elections.  This

is  in reply to the accusation of our opponents  that

this  Government is anxious to remain in office. This

Government, is not anxious to remain in office.  This

Government,  while in office, intends to bring  peace

and  security to Singapore and nothing  is  going  to

deter  it. We will face the electorate when the  time

comes  and  it  is for them to pass judgment  on  our

present  action.  I  have  already  stated  in   this

Assembly that if fresh talks should fail, the purpose

for  which this Government accepted office would have

come  to an end, and there might be elections earlier

than August, 1957.

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> If it please you,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, do I understand the Chief Minister

to  say  that  it  is  the  firm  intention  of  the

Government to seek full and fresh elections,  if  the

constitutional talks are successful, not  later  than

August next, irrespective of the date of the talks?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the hon. Member

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Chief  Minister has already explained the  measures

the  Government has been forced to take to meet the

growing  threat of Communism in the Colony  and  to

put  down  the riots which followed these measures.

For  me,  and  I  am sure for most Members  of  the

House,  the  most disturbing feature has  been  the

prominent  part  played in all these  disorders  by

students  from the Chinese Middle Schools.  Let  me

deal  briefly  with the events which  followed  the

dissolution of the Middle Schools' Students'  Union

in which the schools were directly concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the Union had been dissolved, and

despite  my  warnings that the continued activities

of  the Union were illegal, officials of the  Union

under  various pretexts continued to hold  meetings

both in and out of schools hours. They ignored  the

orders  of  principals and teachers, many  of  whom

admitted   that   discipline   had   broken    down

completely.  On 10th October I therefore  called  a

meeting  of  supervisors and  principals  and  told

them  that it was my duty to see that the boys  and

girls  in their schools were able to work in  peace

and quiet and that I did not see how they could  do

so  as  long  as  there  remained  in  the  schools

teachers   and   pupils  who  were   systematically

encouraging others to flout authority. I  therefore

asked  them  to dismiss two teachers and  some  140

named  pupils. At the same time I issued  an  order

forbidding  any assembly of pupils not specifically

authorised by the principals and requiring them  to

expel any pupils who disobeyed this order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to impress upon them that they could not

hope  to maintain discipline unless they and  their

teachers    dealt    firmly    with     acts     of

insubordination.  But,  I  said,  punitive   action

alone  was  not enough. There were certain  factors

which  contributed  to indiscipline.  Some  of  the

schools were far too large to be manageable;  there

were  children  in their early teens  in  the  same

classes  as  adults in their middle  twenties;  and

too  many pupils whose standards of attainment were

below  normal.  So  long as these  conditions  were

allowed to continue, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



would   be  difficult  for  any  staff  to  maintain

discipline, and I therefore asked the principals  to

supply me with certain information which would  help

the Department to plan the necessary reforms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school authorities accepted as necessary my

demands  for disciplinary action and my request  for

information. But not so the pupils. On the same evening,  large  numbers took possession of the  Chinese

High   School  and  the  Chung  Cheng  High  School.

Supplies of food moved in and preparations were made

for  another  stay-in  strike.  Now,  this  kind  of

action, as the students well knew, put Government in

an  embarrassing position. Unless it was prepared to

use  force  to  expel  the students,  Singapore  was

denied  the  use  of school premises which  provided

places   for  nearly  8,000  children.  The  numbers

camping  in the two schools were not known,  but  it

was  clear  that  several thousands  who  wished  to

continue   their  studies  were  being  denied   the

opportunity  to  do  so. This  time,  with  the  co-operation of two management committees, we were able

to give them that opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th October I sent for the supervisors and

principals  of the two schools and told  them  that

there  was  only  one alternative  to  their  being

called  on  to show cause why their schools  should

not  be declared unlawful. The alternative was that

they  should  temporarily close their  schools  and

second their teachers to the Government which would

then  be  able to accommodate in Government  school

premises  those pupils who wanted to  get  on  with

their lessons undisturbed. This they agreed to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 13th October nearly all the teachers reported

for  duty and on the next day, the registration  of

pupils  for  admission to the temporary  Government

schools began. It had been feared that there  would

be  widespread  intimidation and  a  reluctance  to

register  at the start, but the early response  was

excellent and almost 1,000 pupils had registered in

the  first  three days. Two schools were opened  on

16th October, one for Chinese High School pupils at

Kallang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



West,  the other for Chung Cheng High School  pupils

at  Fowlie  Road.  Both  these  are  new  Government

primary  schools  which  were  made  available  when

pupils in their morning sessions were transferred to

the  afternoon sessions in nearby schools.  Many  of

these children and their parents were put to a great

deal of inconvenience, but I had heard not a word of

complaint. I am grateful to them for their excellent

cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two schools were staffed by teachers from the

Chinese  High  School and Chung Cheng  High  School,

under  Headmasters  also from  these  schools.  They

followed exactly the same syllabuses, used the  same

text-books as before, and were run in every  respect

as  Chinese  middle schools. Yet we have  heard  the

same   old   lies,  endlessly  repeated,  that   the

Government  is  destroying  Chinese  education,  and

often  by people in responsible positions who  ought

to have known better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the Government or its opponents who occupied

the  schools and by doing so effectively closed them

to  other  pupils?  Is  it the Government  which  is

intimidating pupils from attending either their  own

schools or the temporary Government schools?  Is  it

the Government which has burnt down its own schools?

What  sublime hypocrisy to accuse the Government  of

attacking  Chinese education or any other  education

for  that matter, except a Communist education.  And

there,  of  course, is the answer. For these  people

the  words "Chinese" and "Communist" are synonymous.

The Government, on the contrary, believes that there

can be a Chinese education which is not Communist in

any sense of the word, but Malayan in its loyalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me return to our temporary schools. After

the  first  few  days of registration,  the  numbers

began  to fall, and it was clear that the main cause

of  this  was  the campaign of lies and intimidation

which  the  defunct Students' Union and  its  allies

were waging against registration. Yet what was asked

of  those  registering? Nothing more than  that  the

pupil should report to the Registration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



Centre  with  his parent or guardian  who  would  be

prepared  to  sign a bond guaranteeing  future  good

behaviour  and the observance of school regulations.

It  involved no penalty other than the expulsion  of

the  pupil for a serious breach of school  rules.  A

similar  bond is required of pupils at the  Catholic

High  School  and it is difficult  to  see  how  the

Government could be expected to ask for less in  the

present circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the campaign of intimidation, the

number  registering  continued  to  grow,  but   the

interference  with pupils from other middle  schools

became  more  and more flagrant. Large parties  left

the  camp  schools to indulge in  a  form  of  moral

thuggery  which is more dangerous in  its  way  than

physical violence, and it became clear that  further

action by the Government was necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24th October the Government issued a warning to

parents to remove their sons and daughters from  the

schools  before 8 p.m. on the following  day,  after

which  the  schools would be cleared.  Some  parents

heeded  the  warning, but when they arrived  at  the

schools  they  found locked gates and barricades  of

desks.  These obstructions were broken down  by  the

police. Yet intimidation of the waverers amongst the

students by their ringleaders and the 'sabotage'  efforts   of   members   of  the   so-called   Parents

Association  made it difficult for parents  to  gain

access  to  their  children, and  few  succeeded  in

taking  them away. Some indeed, misled by the  lying

propaganda   which  had  been  fed  to  them,   even

encouraged their children in their defiance. Members

of  the  Management  Committees, students  from  the

University  and  others anxious to see  the  schools

open  again  appealed to the students to leave,  but

without  success, so that it became  more  and  more

clear that the students would have to be evicted  by

force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual eviction took place soon after dawn on

26th  October after warnings had been ignored. Tear

gas  was used and the buildings were cleared within

half  an  hour without any serious casualty.  Since

then the premises have been occupied by the police,

though the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



Government  has  discussed with  the  Committees  of

Management the possibilities of reopening them at an

early date. To

this  end, the Chief Minister and I, accompanied  by

some  members of the Management Committees,  visited

both the schools on Thursday last. The intention  of

our  visit was to find out how, soon we could reopen

the  schools - in fact, I wanted to open them  today -

but  seeing that the schools were in a shambles, the

Management  Committees agreed that it was impossible

to  do so. However, at my suggestion, the Management

Committees   agreed  to  clean  up  their   premises

immediately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not dwell upon the part which many students

played  in  the  riots which followed the  eviction.

That is made clear by the large numbers of them  who

were amongst those arrested for rioting. I prefer to

tell  you of the constructive steps I have taken  to

get  the students into school again. As soon as  the

curfew  was  lifted,  I  opened  three  Registration

Centres. This time a limit of four days was set  for

the time in which registration would take place. The

main  reason for this was that it would be  possible

the  more quickly to reorganise the schools and  get

them  running again if it was known how many  pupils

had  to  be  accommodated and in what  classes.  The

response  was very slow at first, partly because  to

launch  an  intensive publicity campaign would  have

meant  more delay, partly because many did not  know

where  the  centres were. But the  daily  enrolments

increased   rapidly.  There  were  521  pupils   who

registered  on Saturday last. The total  number  now

registered is slightly over 2,500.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bare third of the numbers previously

enrolled  in  the  two schools. Why  have  not  more

registered? All that was required was a guarantee of

good  behaviour. No one was refused admission unless

he  had  been  actively  engaged  in  subversion  or

rioting,  and  even then a second  chance  might  be

given  to  any  young  pupil who  had  clearly  been

misled.   The   reorganisation  will   involve   the

separation  of older from younger children,  and  as

far  as  may be practicable, the breakdown of  over-large schools into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



smaller  and more manageable units. All these measures

are   designed  to  lessen  the  chances  of   similar

disorders in the future. What is not being done is  to

anglicise  the  schools. They are  now,  and  will  be

after  the  reorganisation,  Chinese  middle  schools,

but,  I  hope,  Singapore Chinese middle schools.  Why

then  have  not more registered? There are three  main

reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the widespread intimidation. There has, so

far  as  I  know, been no physical violence, but  many

instances  have  been reported to me  of  threats  and

"persuasion".  And  even  when  they  have  not   been

directly  threatened, many of the more  timid  parents

and  pupils have decided that it would be more prudent

to  stay  away  until  conditions  were  quite  normal

again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there has been a widespread whispering

campaign which has maliciously distorted the facts  of

the  registration. Parents have been told  that  registration   meant  the  end  of  Chinese  education   in

Singapore,  that  no over-aged pupils  or  pupils  not

born   in  Singapore  would  be  admitted,  and   that

registration  was  a cloak for Government's  plans  to

arrest  students.  It was even whispered  that  pupils

who  registered  would be put into prison.  All  these

charges  were  deliberate and malicious lies,  but  as

other  countries  have found, it  is  much  harder  to

restore  confidence and trust than it is to sow  seeds

of doubt and suspicion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, thousands of students, often under the

influence  of  mass emotion, have  taken  an  oath  to

fight  to  the  end  against  registration.  Many  now

regret  this  oath but feel bound by  it.  Others  are

afraid  to  break it because they have been threatened

with  violence. I know of an instance  where  a  child

was   threatened  with  death  should  he  attend  the

Government temporary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here let me pause for a little while and ask hon.

Members  of  the House and the public of Singapore  if

it  is  their  wish that our schools should  turn  out

would-be  rioters,  intimidators and  murderers?  That

the  student  leaders,  backed by  an  outside  force,

would  not  hesitate to resort to  violence  is  clear

from an editorial entitled "We are waiting for it"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



issued  on 25th October and found on a blackboard  at

the Chung Cheng High School. It reads

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is now not the time for us to be afraid of our

being  dispersed by force. Rather, it  is  now  high

time  for the colonialists to shiver with fright  at

the  bare  idea of the adventure they are  going  to

take. Ever since the 'May 13th' incident, the people

of Singapore, particularly the students and workers,

have  been much accustomed to violence or bloodshed;

moreover, they have the foresight for the truth that

all  violence or cruel act is sure to end in defeat.

Therefore, whatever force or threat can never  shake

their  determination to struggle. On  the  contrary,

they  will have more confidence and courage to  send

the militants into the grave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dare say affirmatively that should the

authorities  have  the  audacity  to  disperse   the

camping  students by force, Lim Yew  Hock  and  Chew

Swee  Kee  would immediately be thrown out of  their

posts. It is crystal clear to us that our subjective

strength for struggle has got extensively deep  into

and  is  now lurking among people of every  walk  of

life,  particularly among the workers  and  farmers.

This  potential force is sure to explode once  there

is  a  chance  for  it to do so.  If  the  students'

camping should develop into a universal demand for

democracy,  freedom and human right  protection,  it

would be high time for people of every walk of  life

to  launch  an  all-out mobilisation for  the  common

demand.  And the situation will then be more  favour

able to us. For we will then get more closely united

with  them  and form a people's anticolonial  united

front  to bring about re-elections to smash  or  rout

the  entire Labour Front. By then, the blow will not

only be confined to Lim Yew Hock and Chew Swee Kee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubt that Chew Swee Kee has the audacity to

carry  out his threat. Anyway, if he dares  to  take

the  risk to disperse us with force, we are prepared

to  face  the violence. The present conflict  is  no

more  that  of an egg against the rock but  that  of

steel versus the rock."

<br><br>That is the kind of language we have among the

pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, let me put a very blunt question to the

parents of the children.

Is  it  their desire that their children  be  taught

lawlessness and violence before they can distinguish

right  from  wrong? Or is it their sincere  wish - and

the duty of any government - to see that their

children get the education they want, so that  they

can take their rightful place in society after their

school days?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is probable, too, that many parents: have so

lost control of their children that

they refuse to sign a bond. This disruption of

family life is one of the things we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



have to fear from the spread of Communist teaching in

our  schools. Let me read to you a letter taken  from

one of

those recently detained under the Public Security

Ordinance : It reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general rule between father and son,

mother  and  daughter  is not love  but  revolution,

emancipation  and the new replacing the  old.  I  am

telling you this: the first duty of grown-up men and

women is to declare the "Independence Manifesto".  A

man  cannot  be  called a man if he adheres  to  the

authority of his father. A woman who obeys the order

of  her  mother  is unfit to bear  and  nurture  the

citizens of a free nation."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the kind of education we had a month ago.

There  you see the nature of the evil with  which  we

have  to  contend.  When this  kind  of  doctrine  is

preached, is it any wonder that parents and  teachers

find  it  difficult to maintain discipline, and  that

young  men  and women - even boys and girls - are  to  be

found rioting when they should be studying? These are

dangers  of which other countries than Singapore  are

only  too  well aware. The Federation Chief  Minister

has  shown  his  support for our  action  in  a  most

forthright speech recently. The Government  of  Burma

has  taken action against student unions there to try

to  forestall  similar disturbances in that  country.

The  pattern  is  not new and the world  is  learning

slowly  but surely to recognise the danger  in  time.

Even in China today no student unions are allowed  to

function without the guidance of the principals.  Let

me  quote from the Jen Min Jit Pao (official organ  of

the   Chinese  People's  Republic)  and  the  Chinese

Ministry of Education directives on this matter:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Students' Association is not formed

freely  by  the students themselves. The idea  behind

the formation of the Association can perhaps best  be

obtained   from   the  'Regulations   governing   the

formation   of  Students'  Association  in  Secondary

Schools'  promulgated  by the Ministry  of  Education

and  Ministry  of  Higher Education on  December  30,

1955. The prominent points of the regulations are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the Principal, the Students'

Association  assists  the  Youth  League  and   Young

Pioneers  to  respond to Chairman Mao's  call ... ,  and

prepare  the students for service in the construction

and protection of our Socialist mother country ...



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plenary session of the Association may be held

only  with  the approval of the Principal  and  the

participation of the Principal

and the Committee members of the Youth

League ... ".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the factors I have mentioned - intimidation,

lying  propaganda, the oath and the  disruption  of

family   ties -  all   these   have   affected   the

registration. These difficulties were all foreseen.

It  was  known  that the fight would  be  long  and

difficult. The significant thing is not  that  only

2,500 children have registered, but that as many as

that have done so. It means that 2,500 children are

not  only keen to get on with their studies and are

prepared in future to obey school regulations,  but

also that they have had the courage to stand up  to

intimidation. Over 1,500 are already in school; the

rest will be found places, I hope, by tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committees of Management are already preparing

their  schools for work to begin there  again,  but

the  conditions left behind by the camping students

were chaotic and some slight delay is, as I pointed

out earlier, inevitable. As soon as they are ready,

registration  will  be  re-opened  at  the  schools

themselves  for a few days only, but under  exactly

the same conditions as before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This then is the success of the registration

scheme - that  it  has  provided  places  for   2,500

children  in  Chinese middle schools - I  repeat,  in

Chinese middle schools - who otherwise would have had

no  school to go to. It has shown beyond any  doubt

that  it  is  not the Government which  is  killing

Chinese  education  but a mob of reckless  students

and the evil forces behind them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not been an easy task with a very limited

staff  to  organise the registration, staffing  the

classes  and  the  timetables of the  new  schools.

Behind  this operation, so much less striking  than

the  dispersal of rioters, there is a story of long

and involved planning and endless hours of overtime

work on the part of officers in my Ministry and  of

teachers from the two Chinese schools. We  are  apt

to overlook their work in the greater excitement. I

am glad to acknowledge the debt I owe to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have told you something of the Government's

plans to restore order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



the  Chinese middle schools and something too of the

ruthless  forces which still remain to be  overcome.

The  Government is fighting these and will  continue

to  fight  them with all the means at its  disposal.

Yet  in  the last resort the solution lies with  the

Chinese  people  themselves.  Is  their  loyalty  to

Singapore or to elsewhere? Have they the courage  to

stand  up  to intimidation? There are many who  have

clearly  shown  that their loyalty is  not  to  this

country.  The Government has acted and will continue

to  act against them. There are others who have  sat

on  the fence, and they include some in positions of

great  influence who owe everything to this country.

They  are,  no  doubt, more subject to  intimidation

than  others;  by  virtue of  their  position,  they

should  equally show the more courage  in  resisting

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pay a tribute to those who have come out

into   the  open  in  support  of  the  Government's

action.  I refer particularly to those students  who

first  came forward to register and formed the first

classes  in the temporary schools; to those students

in  other  schools  who  resisted  intimidation  and

continued  to  attend school;  to  the  parents  who

braved  the mobs of students and took their children

home. These are the people we should be proud of.  I

yield  to none in my admiration of the work done  by

the  Police and Services in quelling the riots.  But

the  final battle will be won by a display of  moral

courage.  We  must first tell the people  the  truth

and  then they themselves must find in their  hearts

the  moral  courage to face it. The  Chief  Minister

has  led  the way. It is for the people of Singapore

to follow that lead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.59 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

have  the  consent  of His Excellency  the  Governor

under  Standing Order 33 (1) (a) to move, "That  the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of a Bill to repeal and re-enact

the law relating to Muslims and, in particular, to

regulate the registration of marriages and divorces

and  to establish a Shariah Court have already been

accepted by this House at the last session  when  a

Bill,  in almost identical terms, passed its Second

Reading  in February and was referred to  a  Select

Committee. Unfortunately, that Select Committee was

not  able to complete its work and report the  Bill

before the end of the session, and so that Bill has

lapsed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one important exception, this present Bill

reproduces  the  clauses of the  previous  Bill.  A

number  of comparatively minor amendments of  draft

ing or on points of details have been made and they

are  the result of the detailed consideration  that

was  given  to the previous Bill. The important  exception  is  the  omission from this  Bill  of  the

provision  which  was  made in  clause  47  of  the

previous Bill and that provision was that,  in  the

case  of any Muslim dying testate after the  coming

into  force  of the Bill, the law of  Islam  should

apply.   That  clause,  Sir,  raised  an  important

question of principle, namely, whether it is  right

to enforce, by law, the observance of the teachings

of  a particular religion by the individual members

of  that religion. That clause would impose a major

restriction  on  the freedom of the individual,  in

this  case, any Muslim, to dispose of his  property

by will in any way he pleases; and this would be  a

radical  departure  from  the  previously  accepted

principle  that in this community of many religious

beliefs  and  customs, while the  State  can  quite

properly  provide,  by  law,  facilities  for   the

members of a particular religion to practise  their

religion,  the  State  should  not,  in  principle,

compel  anyone to do so but should leave it to  the

free  conscience of the individual to  observe  his

religious

doctrine  or not. Indeed, clause 47 of the previous

Bill was challenged in this House in the debate  on

the Second Reading when, I think it was, the Member

for  Telok  Ayer drew attention to the point  that,

while  in his view it was perfectly proper  in  the

case  of  a Muslim dying intestate without  a  will

that his property



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



should  be distributed according to Muslim law,  it

was  not  right, in his view, that where  a  Muslim

made a will he should not be free to dispose of his

property  as he pleased, whether or not it  was  in

accordance with the law of Islam. This question  of

whether  or  not to include this clause has  caused

great controversy. I think it is well known that it

was  difficulty over the principle of  this  clause

which  delayed  the  work of  the  previous  Select

Committee and prevented it from reporting the  Bill

before the end of the session.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, that clause has been omitted

from  the  present  Bill which is  now  before  the

Assembly,  and  I  must accept  responsibility  for

omitting  that clause, and the reason was  my  keen

desire  to enact, without further delay,  the  non-controversial  clauses  of  this  Bill  which  will

undoubtedly  be  of  great benefit  to  the  Muslim

community  here. I was very anxious,  Sir,  to  get

established without further delay the procedure for

registration  of  marriages and  divorces  and  the

Shariah  Court, matters on which we are all  agreed

and  which are so badly needed, and I did not  wish

to  delay getting these benefits to the Muslim  community through controversy over this one particular

clause  and the two or three provisions related  to

it.   I   hoped   that  perhaps  these   additional

provisions  could be made, if it was so wished,  by

one  of my colleagues introducing an amending  Bill

which  could be done after the Bill as now  drafted

has been enacted. But since the publication of this

Bill,  it has become evident that the vast majority

of  Muslim  opinion is very strongly in  favour  of

including  a clause on the lines of the old  clause

47.  I  have  received very strong  representations

from  the  Muslim Advisory Board and I  am  advised

that  the  whole  of  U.M.N.O. is  solidly  behind

including a clause on those lines, and the views of

the  Muslim Advisory Board have been supported,  to

me,   by   the   Inter-religious  Organisation   of

Singapore and Johore. We have therefore come to the

conclusion that the vast majority of Muslims  would

prefer  that  a  clause on those  lines  should  be

included in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



Bill  even at the cost of delaying somewhat its final

enactment.  The Government has therefore  decided  to

meet the wishes of the Muslim community so widely and

so  strongly expressed, and at the Committee stage  I

shall introduce a new clause on

the lines of the old clause 47. In fairness, Sir, I should say that there has, of course,

been opposition to including this

clause, and this opposition is supported by a  number

of   leading  Muslims.  So  that  hon.  Members   may

appreciate the issue,

I  will, if I may, state very briefly the main points

which  have been made against including a  clause  on

the lines of the old clause 47.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Chief Secretary. There is a notice, item 4 in the Order Paper, of

a motion standing in

your name,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That it be an instruction to the Select Committee

on  the  Muslims Bill to consider amendments  to  the

Bill  to provide that no Muslim shall dispose of  his

property by will

except in accordance with Muslim law."

<br><br>Do I take it then, Mr Chief Secretary,

from what you are saying, that it is not your

intention to move that motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I am moving that motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, perhaps the Chief

Secretary  will not anticipate an item on  the  Order

Paper - his comments

could well come under item 4 in the Order Paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> As you wish, Sir.I will therefore come

back  to  the arguments for and against the including

of  clause 47 al a later stage when I move the motion

tc which you have just referred, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps at this stage I need say no more, then, than

to draw the attention of the House to the fact that I

do  intend  to move this Bill to a Select  Committee,

and  in doing that, I shall move two further motions -

one  asking  that the minutes of, the  evidence  given

before  the  previous Select Committee  which  covered

these  important  points should be referred  to  that

Select  Committee; and the second motion  will  be  a

motion   asking  that  the  Select  Committee  should

specifically   consider  introducing   an   amendment on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



these  lines,  and in moving that last amendment,  I

will  endeavour  to initiate a debate  now  on  that

principle so that hon. Members may have a chance  of

understanding the issues and those who  so  wish  of

expressing their views. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Committal to Select Committee</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

just wondering whether this motion is,

in  fact, empower the Select Committee to take  the

decisions  on  the matters before  it,  and  I  was

wondering,  Sir, whether this motion is,  in  fact,

adequate. I do

support the motion but I would like the Select

Committee to be given full

powers for the purpose for which the motion is

intended.

<div align="center"><b>MUSLIMS BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Consideration of amendments)</b></div>



<br><br>11.15 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it be an instruction to the Select Committee

on  the Muslims Bill to consider amendments to  the

Bill to provide that no Muslim shall dispose of his

property  by will except in accordance with  Muslim

law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this motion is to instruct the

Select  Committee to give this particular  amendment

their  specific attention. The wording of the motion

will  not,  I  am advised, in any way  restrict  the

Select Committee in considering other clauses of the

Bill,  but it will have the effect of inviting  them

particularly to consider including in  the  Bill  an

amendment to provide, as in the case of clause 47 of

the  old Bill, that the law of Islam shall apply  to Muslims  who die testate. As I have already  stated,

it  is my intention, on behalf of the Government  in

that  Select  Committee, to introduce  an  amendment

designed for that purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that it will be useful, both for the Select Committee and in order that this matter shall be fully understood and the issues stated, that we

should  on this motion consider the principle behind

the new clause which I propose to move in the Select

Committee. I have already stated, in speaking on the

Second Reading, that there seems to us on this  side

of  the  House  to be no question at  all  that  the

inclusion  of  such  a clause  is  most  widely  and

earnestly desired by the vast majority of Muslims in

Singapore. It does, however, raise difficulties  and

there are two difficulties to which I should like to

refer briefly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the issue of basic principle. Is it

right in Singapore to compel persons, who profess  a

particular religion, to comply with the precepts  of

that  religion? We must bear in mind, Sir, that this

is  not  a  Muslim  State and hitherto  the  law  in

Singapore  has  allowed  the individual  freedom  of

conscience  to  follow his religion  or  not  as  he

pleases. For instance, it is not an offence in Singa

pore, as it is in several of the Muslim Malay States

of the Federation, for a Muslim to drink alcohol, or

for  a  Muslim to enter licensed premises, or for  a

person  to sell a Muslim coffee during the hours  of

puasa.  If  we  admit in this Bill the principle  of

compelling  a Muslim to follow the law of  Islam  in

wills, are we then prepared to extend that principle

and  to compel them to follow other precepts of  the

law  of  Islam?  And if we admit the  principle  for

Muslims,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



are  we then to extend it for Hindus, Christians  and

other  religious communities which we  have  here  in

Singapore?  That is the first important  question  on

which  Members of this House, and I hope  members  of

the  public, should make up their minds. The question

of  principle - is  it right that we  should  compel  a

person to observe the tenets of his religion?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objection which has been put forward is a

more  practical one which has been put forward indeed

by some Muslims who are against this clause; and that

is,  they  argue  that a clause on  these  lines,  if

enacted,  will  cause hardship to  Muslims,  because,

quite apart from denying to the individual Muslim the

freedom  to  dispose of his property by  will  as  he

pleases,  the effect of this clause will be to  break

up and fragment Muslim estates; so that, for example,

if  a  Muslim who has built up a flourishing business

dies, the business will have to be wound up and  sold

in  order  that  the  proceeds may  be  realised  and

distributed amongst his heirs in accordance with  the

Muslim law of inheritance. This, it is argued,  is  a

grave  handicap  to the building  up  of  Muslim  and

particularly Malay business and commercial interests,

because  the energies and fruits of one man's efforts

cannot  be carried on and sustained and increased  by

his heir or some person whom he thinks most competent

to keep that family business going.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further practical objection which has been raised

is  that  the effect of applying the law of Islam  to

wills  will be to throw into doubt a large number  of

existing  wills  and  may  therefore  lead  to   much

litigation  and  again hardship and  expense  to  the

beneficiaries of an estate. But, on the  other  hand,

Sir,  as  I have said, there seems to be no doubt  at

all  that the vast majority of the Muslims - and  they,

after  all, are the persons most closely affected - do,

nevertheless, want a clause on these lines  included,

and  it  is in deference to that strongly and  widely

expressed  opinion that the Government will introduce

a new clause on these lines at the Committee stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that Members of this House will take

the  opportunity  provided by this  motion  to  put

forward their views for and against legislation  on

the  lines which I have referred to. That will,  of

course, be useful for the Select Committee, and  it

will  be valuable so that public opinion may be  advised of the intention of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, and it is this: if any Member

of  the  Assembly so wishes, he will have a further

opportunity of debating this particular  clause  at

the  Report stage, assuming that we report the Bill

back  including a clause on the lines  of  the  old

clause  47.  He  can do so by moving  a  motion  to

recommit  that particular clause. But I hope,  Sir,

that this morning we shall get expressions of views

from Members on both sides of the House. Sir, I beg

to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

second the motion but reserve my right to speak  at

a later stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I missed the

opportunity  of speaking on the principles  of  the

Muslims  Bill. Now I take the opportunity to  speak

on  this  motion which is item No. 4 on  the  Order

Paper.  Although I am an Indian though born in  the

Muslim   faith,  I  have  never  taken  any  public

interest  in  this  issue as I  never  argue  about

religion. I leave this to the religious experts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, representations were made to me regarding the

clause  to  which the Hon. the Chief Secretary  has

referred  and other clauses in the old Bill  and  I

had to speak on a previous occasion and also in the

previous  Select  Committee on  the  Muslims  Bill.

Singapore  is not a secular State like  India.  The

State religion is Christianity. Any Muslim can,  if

he  wants, make a will during his lifetime.  If  he

does  not  as per Muslim code, he is committing  an

offence   against   his  God  and   his   religion.

Therefore,  why should the estate of  a  Muslim  be

distributed  if  he  dies  after  making  a   will,

according to the Muslim law? This is one side of

the case. But in the Bill itself there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



more  than one controversial point. Here is  a  Bill

asking Muslims to follow the tenets of Islam. At the

same time,

there  is  a  clause in the Bill which goes  against

Koranic  rules. Since 1,400 years, no  man,  however

big,  has  been able to change the Koran. I  do  not

know  who  is  responsible for this,  Sir,  but  the

proviso  in  clause  41 of the  Bill  is  definitely

against the Muslim religion. For those who stand for

the   Muslim  religion  and  want  Muslims  to   act

according  to  Muslim religious laws, this  proviso,

which is against the tenets of Islam, should not  be

there.  This was the main bone of contention in  the

previous  Select Committee. Sir, I had an  interview

with the Chairman of the Muslim Advisory Board and I

have  also received a copy of a letter addressed  by

him to the Chief Secretary dated 18th October, 1956,

in  which the Chairman of the Muslim Advisory  Board

suggests  certain amendments, one of which  is  that

the proviso in clause 41 of the old Bill (1 think it

is  the same proviso in the new Bill) be removed. If

that  is done, then the whole Bill is based  on  the

laws  of Islam and I wonder whether any Muslim  will

have any objection then. I want to be very brief  as

the Bill will be committed to a Select Committee and

it  can  be  more fully discussed there. I  have  no

particular objection to clause 47. The fact is  that

representations on this clause have been made to me,

and  as  an elected Member, it is my duty  to  bring

these   representations   before   the   House   and

eventually before the Select Committee. Some one has

spread the rumour that I am against this clause

personally. That is incorrect. There are always

mischief-makers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone will now be very happy that a

Shariah Court will be established immediately -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

topic -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is

developing an argument which is relevant to item 4,

that is all

right, but I cannot see how a Shariah Court has any

relevance to item 4.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will

permit  me,  I  wish to explain this.  All  this  is

connected  with the Muslim religion and this  clause

is  on the Muslim religion. If you will allow me  to

speak, I will continue.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member can continue, but I

will pull him up again if he is out of order.

that there will be no delay.

the State religion of Singapore is Christianity. May I know the source of his information, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I may or may not be correct,

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, may I have an answer?

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member cannot compel

an answer.

<br><br>11.31 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, speaking as one of the

leaders  of  the Malay community and of U.M.N.O. in

Singapore, I can say without any hesitation  at  all

that this motion has the overwhelming support of the

Malays in this island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the motion, the Hon. the Chief Secretary

has   enumerated  some  pertinent  points  why  this

controversial clause should be omitted. One  of  the

questions  posed was, "If we admit the principle  of

compelling  Muslims to follow the law  of  Islam  in

wills, are we next to compel them to observe puasa?"

On  the  face  of  it, Mr Speaker,  there  is  some

substance  in what he says, but then there  is  this

difference. In the case

of the former, non-compliance with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



Islamic laws affects a number of people, whereas non-observance  of  the  puasa is a matter  between,  the

person  himself  and God. I do not  say,  Sir,  as  a

Muslim, that it is a good thing not to observe puasa,

but it is definitely a lesser evil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been pointed out that Singapore is a

colony  and  not  a Muslim State and hence  Singapore

should not have Muslim laws on its statute book.  The

same  argument,  Sir,  can also  be  applied  to  the

Christian religion and yet we have in our laws  today

provisions  which compel Christians to be monogamous.

I  wonder,  Sir, whether this is a case of one  man's

food being another man's poison !

<br><br>11.33 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, there are one or two observations which

I  consider it my duty to make as Attorney-General  on

the  motion which is now before this Assembly.  As  I

understand  it,  Sir,  what  in  effect  the   Select

Committee is being asked or indeed instructed  to  do

is to consider an amendment to the existing law which

will  limit the freedom which every Muslim at present

enjoys  under  the  law in common  with  every  other

person,  no  matter to what community he belongs,  to

dispose  of his property by will in any way  that  he

pleases.   I   hope,   Sir,  in  making   these   few

observations, to avoid anything controversial, and  I

also  hope  that  what  I do  say  will  be  of  some

assistance to Members of this Assembly and indeed  to

the Select Committee, if it should be appointed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, Sir, I think it is important

that  Members of the Assembly should understand  what

the present law is. This has been referred to briefly

by  one of the Members who has already spoken, and  I

hope  the  House will be patient with me if  I  refer

again  to  it.  Generally, Sir, the  law  at  present

emphasises and underlines the freedom of all  Muslims

to  dispose of their property by will as they please.

So  it  is,  Sir,  that the existing law - the  Muslims

Ordinance - provides that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing in this Ordinance shall be held to prevent

any  Muslim  directing by his will  that  his  estate

shall be administered according to the law of Islam."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, I think, Sir, has been the law here in Singapore since 1880 and that provision is

reproduced  in clause 40 (3) of the Bill  which  is

now before the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, Sir, another provision in the Muslims

Ordinance which takes account of the law  of  Islam

and this provision, I am referring to section 27 of

the Muslims Ordinance which again is reproduced  in

clause 41 of the Bill which we are now considering,

provides, Sir, that in the case of any Muslim dying

intestate,   the  estate  and  effects   shall   be

administered according to the law of Islam.  There

has  been some reference made to the proviso  which

is part of that clause, but I am not concerned with

that  at this moment. So the present position, Sir,

is that, first, all Muslims are free to make a will

and  that, secondly, if a Muslim does make a  will,

he  is  free to -direct that his property shall  be

administered  according to the law of Islam.  That,

as I have said, Sir, has been the law in Singapore -

I  think  I am right in saying - since 1880. Thirdly,

Sir,  the law provides that if he does not leave  a

will,  that  is, if he dies intestate,  his  estate

must be administered according to the law of Islam.

As  I  have said, Sir, the law which I have briefly

stated  has  been  in force in Singapore  for  many

years,  and  I  am  sure  that  Members  will  have

appreciated that any change in the law on the lines

which  the motion before the House now contemplates

will  alter  the existing rights of individuals  in

relation to their property, and will moreover place

under  a  legal  disability in  relation  to  their

property  members of that particular  community,  a

legal disability which it is not intended to impose

on individual members of other communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, Sir, if I may, to refer to one

or two points of detail which might perhaps provoke

some comments from Members of the Assembly and I do

so because I feel - I hope I am right - that the Select

Committee may be assisted by what may be said as  a

result  of some of the points which I am now  going

to  mention. As I see it, Sir, any Select Committee

which may be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



appointed  in  accordance with the  terms  of  this

motion  will  have to consider very  carefully  the

scope of the proposed new clauses. It seems to  me,

Sir,  that  the  matters to be  considered  by  the

Select  Committee should include  the  question  of

what  is  to be done with wills which have  already

been  made when the new legislation is to come into

force. I think, too, that the Committee, I suggest,

would  wish  to consider whether only Muslims  domiciled  in  the  colony should be affected  by  this

legislation.  I  assume,  Sir,  that  it  will   be

accepted  that  this must be the case.  I  suggest,

too,  Sir, that the Committee will perhaps wish  to

restrict the terms of the proposed legislation,  if

there  is  to  be  any,  to  property  situated  in

Singapore,  and  will  further  wish  to   consider

whether  wills  within the scope  of  the  intended

legislation  are to be invalidated  to  the  extent

only  that  they are inconsistent with the  law  of

Islam. Sir, other questions will no doubt occur  to

the  Committee - I am sure they will - and indeed they

may be in the minds

of Members this morning. These particular questions

to  which  I have referred do appear to  me  to  be

questions  of importance and, as I say, if  what  I

have  said will be helpful to the Select Committee,

I  shall be satisfied that what I have said has not

been out of place.

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always

thought that the time has come for provisions to  be

made  to  limit  the  powers of disposing  of  one's

property  by will at one's complete discretion,  and

it   has  been  my  view  for  some  time  that  the

Government should amend the Wills Ordinance in order

to  protect the dependants of a deceased person  who

may not be inclined to think of them and may wish to

dispose  of  his property without consideration  for

the  welfare of his widow and his children. The  Muslim  law, as I understand it, does, in fact,  insist

that  the  widow  and children  of  a  deceased  are

protected  in the disposal of his property.  It  may

well  be, Sir, that the Muslim law goes much further

than  I  would  be  prepared to go in  limiting  the

powers  of  a  person to dispose of his property  by

will, but there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



certainly  a  great  deal  of  good  sense  in   the

protection it seeks to give to the family against an

unreasonable head of the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the question before us now, Sir, is not

whether  we  should  amend the law  of  disposal  of

property in order to protect the dependants, but  we

are  asked to consider a very radical departure from

the   principle  that  has  been  accepted  in  this Assembly,  that is, the principle that we must  give

the   fullest  facilities  to  all  races  for   the

observance   of   their   religious   customs    and

traditions.  In  this  case, the  Muslims  have  the

fullest facilities for observing the law of Islam in

respect  of  the disposal of property in  accordance

with the provisions of clause 40 (3) of the Bill:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing in this Ordinance contained shall be held

to prevent any Muslim person directing by his or her

will  that  his or her estate and effects  shall  be

administered according to the law of Islam."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have the opportunity to do so, but what we are,

in fact, asked to consider is whether they should be

compelled to do so : those Muslims who do  not  wish

to  observe  the  law of Islam in respect  of  their

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we are going from the principle of the

fullest  opportunity for observance of  customs  and

traditions of religious beliefs to the principle  of

policing the enforcement of a religious belief. That

is a very grave departure indeed, because, though  I

will  freely admit that, in so far as I am conscious

of the laws of the various religious customs, at the

time  they were made they were appropriate  for  the

social and economic circumstances then prevailing - it

does not follow that they are appropriate today; and

once  we accept the principle of policing any aspect

of  the  laws  of  a  particular  religion,  we  are

throwing    the   doors   open   for   very    grave

repercussions, particularly in view  of  the  plural

society  and the many religions which are  domiciled

in this territory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, Sir, before this House is

asked to take a decision on so grave a matter, it is

my  hope that the Select Committee will also  advise

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



House  in  its  report of provisions  of  a  similar

character,  if any, and of the conditions prevailing

in  connection  with  the disposal  of  property  by

Muslims   in   the  following  territories   :   the

Federation and each of the States of the Federation,

Indonesia,  Pakistan  and Egypt.  It  is  true  that

Pakistan  is a theocratic State, Sir, but it  would

be interesting to know how they have dealt with this

aspect of Muslim law in these Muslim territories and

to  what  extent this particular law is,  in  fact,

valid and useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust, Sir, that we will not lose the lesson of

this  debate  and that Government will give  serious

consideration  to  a law limiting  the  disposal  of

property by deceased persons in order to protect  to

some extent their dependants at the time of death.



<br><br>11.47 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I most

strongly  welcome the motion moved by my friend  and

colleague   the   Hon. the  Chief   Secretary   for

directing, the  Select Committee  to  consider  the

inclusion  of  the old clause 47. Certain  arguments

have  been raised against the introduction  of  this

clause. One of them is that it is a matter of  basic

principle - is  it  right  to  compel  a  person   who

professes a particular religion to comply  with  its

precepts? Sir, organised society needs some sort  of

curbing,  and  it is recognised that  the  component

members  of  an  organised  society  have   to   tie

themselves  down  with  certain  laws  in  order  to

conduct relations with each other. These laws,  Sir,

have been derived from various sources, but some  of

these  sources are religion, customs and  usage.  In

certain cases the customs and usage have been  based

on  religious  laws,  and in  other  cases  probably

certain  laws have been based on older customs  that

were  prevailing  in  those tribes  and  people  who

received that religion. But it is certain, Sir, that

the  principle has already been accepted of  forcing

members  of  an organised society to follow  certain

rules  in  regard to their conduct with each  other,

and  many  of these rules that are called  laws  are

derived from religious laws.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what is wrong with compelling persons

who  profess  a particular religion to  comply  with

its   precepts?  If  they  like  it,  if  they   are

agreeable  to it, I do not think there  is  anything

wrong.  Sir,  take the principle of any  legislation

that  comes up in any country, going before a  House

of   the  representatives  of  the  people  of  that

country.  If  the  representatives  agree  to   that

legislation  being put through, it  means  that,  according  to the functioning of democracy,  they  are

carrying  out  the  wishes of the people  concerned;

the   people  concerned  being  the  people  of  the

country.  In  this  case the  people  concerned  are

Muslims.  This  legislation will apply  to  Muslims,

and  as far as I am aware, more than 99 per cent  of

the   Muslims   in  Singapore  are  in   favour   of

incorporating this clause in the Bill.  Sir,  if  we

follow  the  democratic  principle  of  this   House

passing  legislation  for the  whole  of  Singapore,

because  it  applies to all the people of Singapore,

then,  on  the  same parallel, Sir, if Muslims  want

certain  legislation which affects them only,  I  do

not  see  any  reason why any Member of  this  House

should  not agree to it. The criterion by which  you

judge  your  laws is whether they are acceptable  in

common  sense. If a law is not acceptable in  common

sense,  then  you say it is bad and  you  refuse  to

pass  it.  But if there are good grounds behind  the

customs or the usage that call for the enactment  of

that  law,  then you say the principles  behind  the

proposed  legislation  are good  and  therefore  you

pass  it.  But, Sir, what are the principles  behind

these provisions in the Muslim law which we want  to

incorporate into clause 47? They are to provide  for

the  rightful heirs of a deceased person.  Sir,  the

Muslim who makes a will has the right, according  to

Islamic  law, to will away one-third of his property

without  consulting anybody. So he has  the  freedom

of  willing away one-third of his property  and  the

restriction applies only

to  the  remaining two-thirds, and the law of  Islam

says that this two-thirds should be applied for  the

benefit  of  his heirs who otherwise might  be  left

unprovided  for.  It  often happens  that  a  person

getting on in age is sometimes

smitten with religion and leaves every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



thing to charity, or he may have a temporary quarrel

with one of his sons and cut him off his will, or he

may  get  into the clutches of a beautiful girl  and

forget about his wife and children -

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> That does not apply to Muslims only.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That is true. Sir, we have also

accepted  the  principle of  compelling  Muslims  to

follow  certain Islamic laws, because clause  41  of

this  Bill  is actually a derivation of an amendment

to  the  Muslims Ordinance in 1924, and compels  the

distribution of the property of an intestate  Muslim

according  to  the law of Islam; but that  does  not

apply  to  other  communities  of  the  society   in

Singapore.  If any person other than a  Muslim  dies

intestate, his property is distributed according  to

the  old English law; but here you are compelling  a

Muslim  who  dies  intestate to  have  his  property

distributed  according to the law of Islam.  So  you

have accepted the principle of compelling Muslims to

follow certain Muslim precepts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was raised as to how far we should go

in compelling Muslims to observe their religion. For

instance, puasa was cited. I would say, Sir, that as

far  as  the people affected are concerned, if  they

want  it,  they  can have it. This is  according  to

purely  democratic principles. The same answer  will

apply  to  the question - should we compel  people  of

other religions to follow their religions? - and  that

is,  if  they want it, they should have it. And  why

not?  In  fact, we have incorporated religious  laws

into  our  laws  in  many respects.  My  friend  and

colleague  the Minister for Local Government,  Lands

and  Housing  mentioned just now that the  Christian

practice of a man being  allowed to marry only  one

wife  is  enforceable  in  the  Penal  Code.  If   a

Christian  marries more than one wife, he is  hauled

up  before  a  court  under the  Penal  Code  for  a

bigamous marriage. That principle has been accepted.

You  are  forcing a Christian to confine himself  to

one  wife at one time! The section in the Penal Code

on bigamy does not read:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing in this Ordinance (or whatever it is)

contained  shall  be held to prevent  any  Christian

from marrying more than one wife."

<br><br>It does not read that way, Sir, as pointed out by my

friend the Member for Cairnhill, and Muslims are not

forced to distribute their property, if they do  not

want  to,  according to the law of Islam. (Referring

to clause 40 (3) of the Muslims Bill.)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice in India, Sir, which is not a

theocratic  State,  is this. The  Muslims  have  been

excluded from that part of the Indian Succession  Act

which deals with testamentary matters and disposal of

property  and succession and so on, so that there  is

no  express  legislation binding the Muslims  not  to

follow  their own religious laws. It is not the  same

position  here  in Singapore, because  you  have  the

operation of the Wills Ordinance so that if a  Muslim

makes  a  will at present which is not in  accordance

with  the  law  of Islam, that will is good.  But  in

India  that  position  has been  neutralised  by  the

exclusion of Muslims from that portion of the  Indian

Succession  Act which deals with disposition  and  so

on.  Case  law  in India has established  many,  many

decades back that, as far as disposal of property  is

concerned,  where  wills are not in  accordance  with

Islamic  laws,  the  law of Islam shall  prevail  and

there  have been hundreds and thousands of  cases,  I

believe,  in  India in which judgment to this  effect

has  been given; and it is a recognised case law  now

in India that that portion of the

will  which is in excess of what is allowed according

to  the law of Islam is not recognised. Further,  the

Shariah Act of

1937  in  India  states that where the  parties  are

Muslims,  then  the  Muslim  personal  law  shall  be

applicable  in matters of succession and other  major

matters  connected with Islamic law.  So  that  there

again is a positive direction to the courts that if a

case  comes  up  where a will is  contested  and  the

parties  are  Muslims, then the Muslim  personal  law

shall  apply. I shall quote, Sir, from Moolah's  10th

Edition,  Principles of Mohammedan Law,  which  is  a

recognised authority in India:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Limits of testamentary power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mohammedan cannot by will dispose of' more than a

third  of the surplus of his, estate after payment  of

funeral expenses and' debts. Bequests in excess of the

legal third cannot take effect unless there is consent

thereto after the death of the testator."

<br><br>There, Sir, you have an answer to the point raised  by

my friend the Chief Secretary as to the breaking up of

Muslim  businesses and estates. That can very well  be

avoided.  Even  though the will is not  in  accordance

with  the  law  of  Islam and if those  aggrieved  are

getting less than what they should but if they consent

to  the  extra portion given to others who should  not

have  got  it under Islamic law, then that bequest  is

valid.  So if a person leaves his business  to  a  son

whom he considers is best fitted to run it, and though

that  son's share of his property is in excess of what

he  should  have according to Islamic law,  the  other

sons  can, by consent after the death of the testator,

agree  to  the business being carried on by that  son.

There  are,  of course, other ways of overcoming  that

difficulty. Limited companies can be formed during the

lifetime  of the testator, or the children  could  be

taken  into  partnership,  in  which  case  when   the

testator  dies, only that portion of the shares  which

is  his  is subject to distribution, and the  rest  is

not.  Then,  of  course, there is  a  proviso  in  the

Islamic law that one-third of the property can be left

by  the testator to anybody he likes. He can make  use

of  that  proviso to leave one-third to any particular

heir  provided he obtains consent beforehand from  the

other heirs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now all the arguments answered point by

point. The final point I wish to make, Sir, is that if

a  Muslim  lady  marries  a Muslim  man,  she  has  an

expectation of a certain share of his property on  his

death. She has that expectation because she married  a

Muslim according to Muslim marriage rites, and both of

them  are  Muslims. Now if the law  of  Islam  is  not

applied and the testator wills away his property as he

likes,  then what happens is that she may be  entirely

cut  off from his will and then she will have lost the

right of expectation to which she is entitled, because

she  has married a Muslim according to Muslim marriage

rites. Sir, there is also an obligation on the part of

the husband



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



to  leave  the  wife her rightful  portion  of  his

property  according to Islamic law, and if  he  can

get  out  of  that at will because the law  of  the

country does not force him to do this, then  he  is

breaking his obligation to her.





<br><br>12 noon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not a

matter  on  which  I am very well  informed  but  I

should  like to make one or two remarks  because  I

personally intend to support the Muslim desire that

they  should  obstruct their economic  progress.  I

should like to explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally dislike very much the introduction

of  any element of theocracy into a State. I  think

it  is  a  very  dangerous thing. My  objection  is

basically a Christian objection. I do not  want  to

get into a lecture on theology, but there is a well-

known saying, "Render to Caesar the things that are

Caesar's and to God the things that are God's"; and

that  is taken by Christians to mean that the State

has  its  proper  functions  and  you  leave  those

ordinary  day-to-day matters to the  State,  whilst

the  things that are God's are matters between  man

and his God. If I acted on that principle as a good

Christian,  I am afraid I should vote against  this

clause  47  when it comes up before the  Committee,

but I do not think it would be appropriate to bring

a Christian principle to bear on a Muslim matter in

this way and I should use other methods of judgment

on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help feeling a great respect for the

Muslim community which is aware, and must be aware,

that this determination to follow strictly the  law

laid  down for the distribution of camels and goats

in  the  deserts  of  Arabia is  not  really  quite

appropriate in dealing with stocks and  shares  and

installations of machinery and that kind  of  thing

in a

modern technological State. They must also be aware

that  it is a difficult law to apply and one  which

will be economically difficult for their community.

I honour

very highly their willingness to make sacrifices of

wealth  and expectations of profit in the interests

of their faith, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



I think that is a factor which should be given full

weight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Socialist, I also see certain socialist

advantages  in  it. I have pointed  out  that  this

Muslim  religious law is inappropriate in a  modern

capitalist State. I do not think it will  have  any

particular bad effect if we have a fully  Socialist

State   because   there  will   be   nothing   very

significant  to leave in your will, and  therefore,

as  far  as it goes, this Muslim law would  fit  in

quite  happily with a Socialist State which I  hope

some day we shall establish. For those reasons, Mr

Speaker,  I personally intend to give my voice  for

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it be an instruction to the Select Committee

on  the Muslims Bill to consider amendments to  the

Bill to provide that no Muslim shall dispose of his

property  by will except in accordance with  Muslim

law.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's

authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$672,122 shall be supplied to the Government  under

the  heads  of  expenditure and  for  the  services

specified  in  the Schedule contained in  Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 59 of 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this paper deals with the applications for supplementary provision which are

required  to  balance over-expenditure  in  certain

votes in the 1955 accounts.

Hon.  Members will note that, in some cases,  over-

expenditure   has  occurred  because   bills   have

inadvertently been debited to the wrong  votes.  It

is not

really surprising. I do not know exactly how many

bills, vouchers, etc. the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



financial clerks of Government have to deal with  in

the  course of a year but it must run into  hundreds

of  thousands. These minor inadvertencies are  bound

to  occur. What is surprising is that they occur  so

infrequently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule contains eight items and only one of

these  items is for a sizeable amount. That item  is No. 368  which refers to the Regional Fisheries  Research  Laboratory at Changi. There has  been  over-expenditure to the extent of $657,624, all of  which

is   recoverable   from  Colonial  Development   and

Welfare  funds.  Hon.  Members  may  ask  why  over-expenditure  of  this  amount  occurred  without  an

application for supplementary provision being  made.

I  asked  the  same question when my  attention  was

drawn to the matter early this year. Enquiries  were

made  and it is clear that the omission was  due  to

the  fact  that the eminent scientist in  charge  of

the  station  was not completely familiar  with  the

requirements of financial General Orders and to  the

fact  that he spent much of the latter part of  1955

at  sea  with  the research vessel  the  arrival  of

which  he  had  anxiously waited for  so  long.  The

officer  concerned  has had his attention  drawn  to

the  requirements  of financial  General  Orders  in

this connection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over-expenditure in connection with the Cambodian

Trade  Fair was permitted as it was clear  that  the

original  Singapore provision would not be  exceeded

and  that  it  seemed  better to  wait  until  exact

requirements     were    known    before     seeking

supplementary provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this motion, Sir, is to seek the

approval  of  this  Assembly as  is  required  under

paragraph   9   (a)   of   the   Personal   Injuries

(Civilians)  Scheme,  1941,  to  new  and  increased

rates of Cost of Living Allowance to be paid on  pensions   paid  under  that  Scheme.  The  new   rates

proposed  are set out in detail in the  Schedule  to

my motion on the Order Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme was drawn

up   in  1941  to  provide  for  granting  pensions,

allowances  and gratuities to members of  the  Civil

Defence  organisations  who suffered  injury  during

the  war  or to the dependants of those of them  who

were  killed  or  died  and  that  Scheme  was  also

applied to the armed volunteer forces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the basis of calculating pensions and

allowances under that Scheme was the normal  monthly

earnings  of  the person concerned at  the  time  of

injury  or  death. With the marked decrease  in  the

value  of  money  after the war, it was  immediately

necessary  to  supplement these very small  pensions

and  allowances  by a Cost of Living  Allowance.  So

Cost  of  Living Allowances on these  pensions  were

introduced  and  approved by  a  resolution  of  the

Legislative  Council in 1949, the rates coming  into

force with effect from the 1st of January, 1948.  At

that  time, those rates of Cost of Living Allowances

on  these  pensions were in line with  the  Cost  of

Living  Allowances  paid on the ordinary  Government

service  pensions. Since then, however,  there  have

been   revised   and  increased   Cost   of   Living

Allowances  and  other allowances  on  the  ordinary

Government pensions and this motion that I now  move

seeks  to  get  approval for new rates  of  Cost  of

Living  Allowances for pensions under  the  Personal

Injuries  Scheme which would bring those  allowances

again   into  line  with  the  allowances  paid   on

ordinary  Government service pensions in so  far  as

that  is  possible.  I say in  so  far  as  that  is

possible   because  there  are  certain  fundamental

differences between pensions under this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



Personal  Injuries  Scheme and ordinary  Government

pensions.  For instance, one, whereas  an  ordinary

Government service pension depends upon the  length

of  service  and the salary of the officer  on  his

retirement and there is no change in the amount  of

pension  according  to  whether  the  officer   has

dependants,  pensions under the  Personal  Injuries

Scheme   are  provided  for  wives  and   dependant

children, so that, therefore, while Cost of  Living

Allowances  on  service pensions  take  account  of

family circumstances, Cost of Living Allowance on

these pensions do not, because the pension itself

takes that into account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general effect of the increases now proposed

is  to increase the total amounts payable under the

Scheme  by  about  30 per cent.  The  exact  amount

varies  in each case according to the circumstances

of  the  pension. There has been, I  am  afraid,  a

great  deal  of delay in working out these  revised

rates  and  in  solving a number of  administrative

problems connected with them and, for this  reason,

we  have  felt it justified to bring the new  rates

into force with effect from the 1st of January.  As

my friend the Hon. the Financial Secretary had just

stated,  the  money to pay what is required  during

the current year will be included in an application

which  he  will  make  immediately  following  this

motion.

<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 60 of 1956)</b></div>

<br><br>2.47 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's

authority to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

S1,457,350  shall be supplied to  the  Government

under  the  heads  of  expenditure  and  for   the

services  specified in the Schedule  contained  in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 60 of 1956.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps the most important items in this

paper are Nos. 359 and 360. These seek provision to

enable the revision of service pensions to be implemented. The question of the revision of service  of

pensions has been outstanding for some time and the

Labour  Front Government undertook to  examine  the

matter shortly after taking office. At that time, a

committee of the Federation Government was  already

engaged  in examining the matter. Pension  revision

has always been taken on a pan-Malayan basis and it

was   decided   to  await  the  outcome   of   this

examination before taking action in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation committee reported towards the end

of   1955.  It  recommended  a  revision   of   the

Adjustment  Allowances paid on  pensions  in  issue

before August, 1947, and the introduction of a  new

Supplementary  Allowance to all pensions  in  issue

before the 1st of January, 1955. A later committee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



also   recommended   the  consolidation   of   all

allowances and pensions and the revision  of  Cost

of  Living  Allowance  paid on  post-consolidation

pensions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations with regard to Adjustment and

Supplementary Allowances were subsequently accepted

by  the  Federation Government and introduced  with

effect  from  the  1st  of  January,  1955.   These

recommendations have been drawn up in the light  of

Federation conditions and it was necessary to  find

out  whether  they  could be applied  in  Singapore

without  modification or whether some  modification

was   required.  This  examination  has  now   been

concluded  and  it has been decided to  follow  the

Federation  recommendations with regard  to  Adjustment Allowance and Supplementary Allowance in broad

principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adjustment Allowance introduced in 1950 with

effect  from  1947  rose to a maximum  of  $25  per

mensem  on pensions of between $150 per mensem  and

$180  per  mensem  and then gradually  tapered  off

until it disappeared altogether on pensions of $320

per  mensem and over. The reason why the  allowance

was  tapered  off  in  this way  was  that  it  was

considered at that time that pensions of  $320  per

mensem  and over were adequate and did not  require

revision.   Subsequently,   however,   doubt    was

expressed about the propriety of tapering  off  the

allowance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



in  this  way. It was considered that the principle

of   adjustment  should  have  been  carried  right

through  the  scale. When Complementary  Allowances

were  introduced in 1953, the principle of tapering

off was abandoned and the allowance was applied  to

the  whole  scale subject to a ceiling of  $60  per

mensem on pensions of $400 per mensem and over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as a first step towards the revision of

pensions,  it is appropriate and it is proposed  to

remove  the anomaly of tapering from Adjustment  Allowances and to fix a ceiling of $25 per mensem  on

all   pensions  in  excess  of  $180  per   mensem.Secondly, it is proposed to introduce a new  Supplementary Allowance of the same nature as the revised Adjustment  Allowance  and Complementary  Allowance

and to apply it in the manner described in the Cmd.Paper.  These two measures will have the effect  of

adjusting  pre-consolidation  pensions  with  post-

consolidation  pensions in so far as adjustment  is

practicable and justifiable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerable thought has been given to the

question  of  a  date  of implementation.  As  hon. Members are aware, the Government is against  back-dating as a matter of principle. On the other hand,

the  previous  Government gave  an  undertaking  to

examine  the matter of revision sympathetically  in April,  1955,  and  the Federation  Government  has

implemented  with effect from the 1st  of  January, 1955. In the circumstances, it has been decided  to

implement  with  effect  from  the  same  date   in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Deliberately commented -->Hon. Members are aware that depreciation in the

value  of money and in the purchasing power of  the

dollar has made conditions difficult for Government

pensioners  and I feel sure that they will  support

this measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 361 seeks provision to pay a revised rate of Cost of Living

Allowance to pensioners under  the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme

which has  now been approved by the Assembly.

special  comment. A full explanation of the need  for

the supplement is given in each case.

number of colonial students in Dublin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I find that

completely unsatisfactory. It may well be  on  a  pro

rata  basis but at the same time it can be completely

worthless.  If there are 7 colonial students  in  all

and  each colony has to pay a seventh part,  that  is

pro  rata  but I am not paying $4,638 of the colony's

money for one student. That is an exaggerated way  of

putting  it,  it  is  true, Sir, but  this  House  is

entitled  to  full information when  spending  public

money.  I  therefore move, Sir,  that  this  item  be

adjourned for

further    consideration   at    a    later    date.

The matter has been considered with great care by the Treasury.

<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  motion which stands in my name  reads  as

follows,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the further action

of  the Labour Front Coalition Government under the

Banishment  Ordinance, the Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



the   Societies   Ordinance  against   persons   and

organisations  without  producing  any  evidence  to

justify its action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last sitting of this House, the first

phase of the big purge, which we knew was coming, has

been  completed. No less than some 300  persons  have

been arrested for banishment or detention and about a

dozen  organisations have been dissolved. There  have

been  riots, arson, 13 deaths and about 100  injured.

It  is curious that all these things should happen in

October.  It is the time for wars and revolutions  in

the  northern hemisphere. When the harvest  has  been

collected,  men's minds and energies turn  to  things

other than the necessities of life and somehow I feel

that  it  must have been laid down in the stars  that

this  autumn  1956 was going to be a troubled  one  :

riots   in  Poznan  in  Poland,  Budapest,  Hongkong,

Singapore, and now a big war in the making in  Egypt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average man reading the local newspaper must

have  become quite cynical by now. When  there  were

riots, in Hungary and the students rose against  the

brutal   oppressive  regime.  Western   commentators

hailed them as patriots and courageous students  who

rose  in defence of their freedom and welcomed  them

when  they  put  demands against the Government.  On

23rd October, the Straits Times said in headlines:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifteen demands listed by the students include:

Complete  freedom  of the Press,  abolition  of  the

death  penalty, permission to make trips to  Western

countries and the import of Western literature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of students told the authorities that

they  will stage street demonstrations unless  their

demands   for   more  freedom  and   better   living

conditions for the whole country

are granted within 14 days."

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> University students.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, when Chinese Middle School

students staged a stayin strike, they were denounced

as  subversive tools and lackeys of the  Communists.

When  the  Police flushed them out, it  was  greeted

with  ovation in the name of democracy and  freedom.

The  hypocrisy of the whole business on  both  sides

leaves the average man sickened. Depending upon  where

one stands, and on which side the students are - they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



are  either democratic or subversive; they are either

patriots  or tools and lackeys. I am quite sure  that

in   the   Hungarian  Press  and  in  Moscow   papers

Hungarian students must have been denounced  and  the

Singapore students hailed as patriots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein does the truth lie? Who was responsible for

the  riots?  Who  began them? Who is  in  the  right?

There  has  been  such a spate of  biased  propaganda

that  we might do well to retrace the events  of  the

last month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister in his statement this

morning  gave his Government's version of  what  took

place.  The  charge  is that these  300  "subversive"

characters, who are now safely in jug, and these  now

dissolved   Communist-front   organisations    were

responsible  for the rioting, and the  shooting  that

became  necessary, the arson, the curfew and all  the

hardships  that  followed. I  find  it  difficult  to

agree with that interpretation of events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 7th September, the Labour Front Coalition

Government  received a unanimous vote  of  confidence

from  the whole of the Legislative Assembly on  their

promise  to  call  an  all-Party conference  to  plan

tactics  for  the  next merdeka  talks  and  to  plan

united  action  in  case the talks failed.  I  repeat

once  more: Not one word then was let out  about  the

big purge which must have been decided on by then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18th September, six persons, all well-known

leaders of trade unions or civic organisations,  were

arrested  for  banishment  to  China.  That  was  the

opening gambit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a clever and a cunning way, the Government

spotlighted  the  attack on "Aliens,"  on  those  not

born  in  this country. In this way, it isolated  the

Chinese-speaking section of the population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next move was against the Chinese Middle

Schools'  Students' Union. Again the Chinese-speaking

section  of the population. First, the Union was  banned.  Then  the  President  was  arrested  under  the

Preservation  of Public Security Ordinance.  The  day

before   the  Legislative  Assembly  debate  on   3rd

October,   they   arrested  Chia  Ek  Tian,   Central

Executive Committee Member of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. and Assistant Secretary of the Bukit Panjang

Branch of the Factory and Shop Workers' Union.  This

was a direct warning to the Secretary General of the

Singapore  Factory  and  Shop  Workers'  Union  (the

Member for Bukit Timah). There was no attempt to disguise this warning in the debate. The Hon. the Chief

Minister openly stated that he was prepared to  move

against  anyone  on  whom  the  Police  had   secret

information  that he was subversive. The implication

was:  the fact that he was Secretary General of  the

Singapore   Factory   and  Shop   Workers'   Union,

Assistant  Secretary General of the P.A.P. and  an

Assemblyman was not going to protect him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next move was on the 10th of October - once more

against the Chinese school students. A list  of  142

students   was   given  to  the  School   Management

Committees.  They  were to expel these  students  if

they  wanted  to  continue the schools.  Surely  the

Government   did  not  expect  that  the  Management

Committees would quietly go back and tell  the  142

students  that they were expelled and that  was  the

end  of the matter? Immediately, there was a stay-in

strike  at  the  Chinese High School and  the  Chung

Cheng  High  School.  Meanwhile,  to  keep  up   the

pretence  of  democracy, public  rallies,   public

signature campaigns were allowed, and the propaganda

battle  went  on from 10th October to 24th  October - a

battle which very few people have any doubt that the

Government lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 24th of October, the purge moved into top

gear.  The  Hon. the Chief Minister broadcast  over

Radio  Malaya and gave the students roughly 24 hours

to  clear out from the schools. Sir, no one had  the

slightest doubt that in that situation that was  the

fuse.  The Government had decided to make the  final

big  push. Yes, it is true that the People's  Action

Party held a meeting at

the Beauty World on the 25th October from 5 p.m. to

7 p.m. The dead-line for the big flush out was 8 p.m.

A half-

hearted attempt has been made to throw the blame of

the rioting which took place, on this meeting at

which the Hon. the Chief Minister said that the

Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



made inflammatory speeches. I have said this to  the Government time and time again. If he said  anything

which  was  seditious  or if anybody  said  anything

which is against the law, he can be charged, he  can

be  prosecuted for it. To my knowledge, no  one  has

been charged or prosecuted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that night as I came down from the meeting at

Bukit  Timah  at 7 o'clock I had not  the  slightest

doubt  that  something was going to  happen.  Nobody

who  passed that way had the slightest doubt. Crowds

were gathering outside the Chinese High School.  The

whole  road  was jammed. The Police made no  attempt

to  disperse  the  crowd. They  cordoned  off  Bukit

Timah  Road and diverted traffic into Dunearn  Road,

but  the people were not asked to break up and  move

along.  Knowing  the temper of the crowd,  one  must

assume  that sooner or later such a crowd would  get

out  of  hand.  Why the Police chose to  do  nothing

until  it  got out of hand is a question which  only

those  who  planned  the Labour Front  strategy  can

answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister in his statement

this morning skated over the riots. He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This was the situation, Sir, when the first riot

incidents developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to take up the time of hon.Members by giving a detailed account of the riot

incidents, as these have already been

reported in the Press."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is true. But we knew that that was the signal

for  the  big  purge. At half-past eight,  riots;  at

half-past two the next night, Police parties  raided

the   Factory  and  Shop  Workers'  Union,  the  Bus Workers'   Union  and  arrested  some  250   persons

including  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong,  the  Member  for Bukit  Timah,  and Mr Devan Nair, both  members  of

the  Central Executive Committee of the P.A.P.  From

then  on,  the purge was in full swing  and  in  the

following days of rioting and day and night  curfew,

more  subversive elements were picked  up.  Then  on

the  2nd  of November, the Government announced  the

dissolution

of  the  Farmers  Association and the  Wooden  House

Dwellers   Association.   The   leaders   of   these

Associations  were already arrested.  They  were  at

the premises of the Factory and Shop Workers'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



Union on the night of the 25th. Those are the facts.

On  those  facts,  we ask these questions.  Who  was

responsible? Who began it? Who was right?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did not believe that the Hon. the Chief

Minister  would have no less eminent a  person  than

the  Prime  Minister of England set the  example  in

giving flimsy pretexts for police actions. The Prime

Minister of England said, "British troops are  going

to land in Egypt because they are going to carry out

a  Police  action. For the sake of peace, democracy,

freedom,  happiness of mankind, it is  necessary  to

bomb  Egyptian citizens and occupy the Suez  Canal."

The  whole  world  says, "This  is  naked  and  open

aggression."  The Prime Minister of England  is  not

disturbed. He said that he was carrying out the duty

which  the  United Nations should have carried  out.

The  Israelis in anticipation of attack attacked the

Egyptians. Because they were going towards the  Suez

Canal, the British and French decided that they must

protect  the freedom of the waterway and intervened -

intervened  not  by  attacking  the  aggressor   but

intervened  by  joining the aggressor and  walloping

the defender. Mr Gaitskell for the Opposition said,

"The  British  joined  the  burglars  and  shot  the

householder."  If I had to choose between  being  in

the company of the Rt. Hon. Sir Anthony Eden and the

Rt.  Hon. Mr Hugh Gaitskell, I would rather  be  on

the side of the leader of the Opposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what it is all about. Sir, the Government

has   declared  that  its  intention  is  to   purge

subversive elements and break up the Communist-front

organisations. We are a generous people  by  nature.

Therefore we assume that the Member for Seletar (Mr

Nair)  became Assistant Minister to the Chief  Secretary  because of an intense desire to help to  purge

the  subversive  elements,  to  save  Singapore  for

democracy,  to save this vital corner  of  the  free

world  in  the interest of democracy. That  was  the

declared intention. We accept it at face value.  But

in  the battle, I fear that Government was defeated.

By the time the battle was joined and the "Middle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Road  boys"  were nabbed on the night of  the  26th,

the  Chinese-speaking population  of  Singapore  was

convinced  that the Government was not  purging  subversive  elements but were crushing Chinese culture,

civilisation and education, and that the  Government

was  oppressive and fascist. Sir, I do  not  believe

that my friend the Member for Ulu Bedok (Inche Abdul

Hamid bin Haji Jumat) is a Fascist.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> My only regret was that he never

brought it home to the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> What did you do?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I did not embark on this

purge.  If  I had to embark on this purge,  I  would

use  the  Preservation of Public Security  Ordinance

against  Mr  Sutherland and see that  he  does  not

cause  more  damage to Singapore than Europeans  are

already  doing.  The  foolish, the  silly,  the  completely  inept  interference in local  affairs  when

the  best thing they can do is to slink out  of  the

picture  has  convinced me that  the  white  man  is

determined to destroy himself in the Far  East.  Not

only they have decided to destroy themselves in  the

Far   East   but  they  have  decided   to   destroy

themselves  in the whole of the Middle East  too.  I

was  very  amused  to  see  that  the  Minister  for

Communications  and  Works  (Mr  Thomas)  had  very

little  to  say on Egypt. The man who has  something

to  say on everything, including the Muslims Bill on

which  he  admitted  he  knew  nothing,  could   not

condemn  his  own Government for a  fascist  act  of

aggression.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Not my Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Now, come, let us not quibble

about these niceties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Leave him alone and let him

have his fun.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, this is not fun. This is

serious  business.  I could not  understand  why  an

elected  Government which had admitted that  it  did

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



have internal security in its power (everybody knows

that  we went to London and fought the British  over

internal  security and we all packed  up  over  that

issue) should have embarked on this purge. They lost

the  battle because the odds were against  them.  As

long as the British are here, to use British troops

against their own people to carry out this purge  is

the seal of death of any political Party. We watched

with  extreme  interest the play of forces.  I  have

said this before and I say this now: there are three

forces   in   this  country;  British   Imperialism,

Communism and Malayanationalism.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Where are you?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I said before that I am

nationalist  and I still am. But for  a nationalist

to  go  and join forces with the British before  one

has got the upper hand on the British is a political

act of folly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the propaganda campaign which was being waged,

the  Government had the whole apparatus of state  in

its  hands  :  the radio, a friendly  Press  at  its

disposal. It could have called public meetings.  But

it  was  the other side that organised. Six thousand

students, everyone of them went home to a family  of

ten  and  convinced  the  family  of  ten  that  the

Government was fascist. Six thousand times ten makes

60,000. There were mass signature campaigns all over

the town, and the Government could not even move  in

its  defence. Whatever the Government's  intentions,

it  has  not  succeeded in bringing it home  to  the

people. If we want to run a democrary, we must  have

the people on our side. That was what the Government

did not do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been persistent demands for public

trials for these persons who have been arrested.  It

is  the least that the Government can do to retrieve

their  position.  If, in fact,  these  men  were  re

sponsible  for the riots, were responsible  for  the

disorders  and were, in fact, going to  organise  an

armed overthrow of the Government, then let there be

open trials, or let us have a public inquiry. Let



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  produce its  evidence  publicly  to

substantiate  the  allegations it has  made  against

the  subversive  elements and these  Communist-front

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had hoped this morning that they might have

produced  the Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim  Ching Siong)  to  participate in these proceedings  but  I

was  disappointed. In fact, I had a letter  for  him

sent  from  Kota Bahru, no doubt someone hoped  that

he  would  be  coming out here  to  make  his  stand

against  the  Government in the proper Assembly  for

public debate. The Hon. the Chief Minister had  said

that  some people were under a misapprehension  that

an  Assemblyman could not be arrested. Let  me  tell

him  that the Member for Bukit Timah was never under

such  a misapprehension. The Member for Bukit  Timah

was  quietly waiting for him and his Police  on  the

morning of the 25th of October -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> 27th.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> 27th. I beg his pardon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have so far been unable to trace a Report

of  the  House of Commons No. 164 of 1940  in  which

reference  was made to a book on constitutional  law

that  a  Member  of Parliament can  be  detained  by

preventive   detention  by   order   of   executive

authority.  I  do  not know how far this  particular

Report  applies to our situation. That was a  Report

in  time  of  war  and we are in  a  very  different

position  here.  But I do hope,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

that   not   only   will  you  have   received   the

information  of the arrest of the Member  for  Bukit

Timah, but you would at the same time look into  the

constitutional   position   which   the    Member's

detention  has  created. Amongst other  things,  one

wonders  if the Orders in Council which say  that  a

Member  who is absent from two consecutive  sittings automatically vacates his seat are going  to  apply

in the case of the Member for Bukit Timah.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not in his case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, I expect that if Her

Majesty's colonial Government of Singapore  prevents

the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



for Bukit Timah from appearing in this Assembly,

that is a reasonable excuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not really the constitutional position

that we are concerned about.

If  the  Government  wants to retain  the  slightest

pretensions to democracy, it must bring  the  Member

for Bukit Timah to open trial. If it cannot, then it

must  release him. And that goes for all  the  other

persons who have been detained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister knows well the case of

Mr Seah Yong, translator of the Nanyang Siang Pau. Mr Seah Yong was

arrested on banishment

and the Singapore Union of Journalists have this  to

say  of  Mr Seah Yong in a release on the  26th  of

October, 1956:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three officials of the Singapore Union of

Journalists visited Mr Seah Yong at the Outram Road

Remand  Prison on October the 20th five  days  after

his  arrest on Banishment Orders and interviewed him

for  an hour. As a result of that interview, we  are

more  than ever convinced that Mr Seah was  not  involved  in activities aimed at illegally undermining

the  Government and our fears for the freedom of the

Press have been immeasurably increased."

<br><br>And the Singapore Union of Journalists sets out what

Mr Seah told them took

place in the interrogation and it has this comment

to make:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fact that these four questions were

put  to  Mr  Seah and that he was not  interrogated

about  anything else is difficult to reconcile  with

your (meaning the Chief

Minister's) assurance that Mr Seah's activities had

no connection with his trade union

activities."

<br><br>Sir,  the  Union of Journalists may or  may  not  be

right.  The  point  is  that there  is  considerable

public disquiet as a result

in  part of inept tactics and inept handling of  the

situation.  If the Government gets the  journalistic

profession  against  it, then  the  Government  must

expect  that  the Press is likely to be  unfriendly,

and  even to make worse the terrific public campaign

against the activities of this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one side of the question : convincing the

people  by  open  trial in Court or by  some  public

inquiry  that  the  Government's  action  was  well-founded and that there was evidence to justify  such

action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another side to the Government's

action.  That is the toxic side effects of  this  big

dose of purgative that the Government has decided  to

administer. The Government carried out its  purge  of

"subversive"  characters. Now private employers  have

decided  to carry out their private purges, following

the  example of the Government. In some cases, there

are signs that these private purges were pre-arranged

because  the employers moved from prepared positions.

The  Tay Koh Yat Bus Company, for instance, had  some

50  odd  spare drivers and conductors for  some  time

before this big purge began. After the purge, the Tay

Koh Yat Bus Company carried out its own purge. It  is

the  same story all over again. A new union had  been

formed  called  the  Singapore  Transport  Employees'

Union.  There  was an agreement with  the  old  union

which  had 270 members in the Tay Koh Yat Bus Company

regulating  the hours of work. Now the  Company  says

that  this agreement is invalid. They said it on  the

3rd  of  November.  A  new  work  schedule  has  been

introduced  and  all  the old  270  members  are  now

undergoing special treatment at the hands of the  Tay

Koh Yat Bus Company. These were men who were formerly

given eight hours of work a day by agreement between

the Company and the Bus Workers' Union. These men are

now  put on 2-hour shifts, and members from the spare

pool  and the special reserve spare pool are  getting

the  8-hour shifts. Slowly the Company, as  this  new

Transport Employees' Union expands, will clean up the

remnants  which  the Government had not  cleaned  up,

probably because the Government had decided that they

were  not "subversive". But from the Company's  point

of view, they are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular instance, there are signs of pre-arranged positions, which means that the Company had

an  inkling  that there was going to  be  this  opportunity  and seized it. But there are others  who  did

not  move from pre-arranged positions. There is,  for

instance,  the Yew Lee Cheong Tin Factory.  They  did

not  expect  this  but the moment it  happened,  they

sacked all 23

workers and all members of the Factory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



and  Shop Workers' Union. The whole lot was purged.

Hume  Industries  purged 6 shop  stewards.  Malayan

Textile  Mills : 1 spinning worker, a shop  steward

was  purged. It seems that the Imperial  Government

too  wants to carry out a private purge of its own.

The Naval Base authorities took the opportunity  to

revoke the pass that the

Member for Sembawang (Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim)  has

had for years and years to enter the Naval Base.  I

warned  the Government when we passed the Protected

Places  Ordinance that they must be on their  guard

and  not allow this Ordinance to be abused  by  the

Naval  Base  authorities or by any other  employer.

But  the  Naval  Base says, "As  a  result  of  the

emergency,  casual visitors cannot be allowed  into

the  protected  place." Sir, I might  have  been  a

casual  visitor  going  up to  advise  the  General

Council of the Naval Base Labour Union when  I  was

stopped by the Naval Base authorities, no doubt for

reasons  of  state, for the security of  the  Naval

Base,  the  Dockyard and the ships inside.  But  to

exclude  the  Member  for  Sembawang  as  a  casual

visitor - 4,000 of his constituents are living inside

the  Base - and they had previously issued a pass  to

him, is an example of the chain reaction which  the

Government  has set in motion. The Government  says

that  it  has channels of information not available

to other members of the public. We must assume that

those  whom the Government had not purged had  been

cleared  of  any  subversive tint. Obviously  these

employers   have  also  got  private  channels   of

information  not available to the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  and  they  are  carrying  out  their  own

purges.  On his own reasoning, the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  should  approve of their  actions:  "Yes,

they  are  quite  right because as  they  are  well

informed  we should not doubt the wisdom  of  their

action."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is an even more poisonous side-effect

of  Operation Liberation namely, the appearance  of

British   troops,  rifles,  bayonets,  helicopters,

aeroplanes, Commanders-in-Chief. Sir, the Hon. the

Chief Minister said that the elected Government was

in com-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



mand  of Operation Liberation. But how can the Hon.

the  Chief  Minister counter the  effect  of  these

British  troops at barricade points at all bridges?

How can he counter the pictures in all the Press of

Maj.-Gen.   Tulloch,  General  Officer  Commanding,

Singapore  Base District, and of Mr Nigel  Morris,

Commissioner  of  Police, in charge  of  the  whole

operation? The identification in the minds  of  the

people  of  this Government with armed  British  Imperialism is something which will take a long  time

to live down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going to be the denouement? I am not

interested   in   the  immediate  result   of   this "Operation Liberation". The reality of power  is  in

the hands of the British. Let us face that fact. The

days  of  the curfew and the riots brought home  the

truth that he who has the rifle barrel has the  last

word.  A  great  Chinese Marxist  dialectician  once

wrote  that a new society is born out of  the  rifle

barrel.  That  is  true of this  situation:  with  a Britain  tough, reactionary, its Government prepared

to  precipitate a world war to defend  its  economic

interest  in  the Middle East. If you  cannot  wrest

that  rifle  barrel from her, then  you  are  in  no

position to argue with her. To have gone behind  the

white man holding a rifle barrel is, in my analysis,

a tactical error.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Front may be right in believing

that  its actions will win sympathetic approval from Mr  LennoxBoyd and the Tory British Government. But the  Labour  Front also believes that  it  will  win concessions  for  merdeka in this  way.  The  Labour

Front  is wrong. As long as this Tory Government  is

in  power,  any attempt to exercise merdeka  in  the

interest  of  the people of Malaya, any  attempt  to

take  away  gold dollars from Britain to  raise  the

standard of living of the people of Malaya, will  be

met with the most terrific resistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct policy would be to use this power

situation,  of the British, the Communists  and  the

Nationalists, in such a way as, first,  to  put  the

British into an untenable position. Having put  them

into  an untenable position, then we shall be  in  a

position to take over the rifle barrel.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this whole tangled skein is unravelled in ten

months'  time - I hear elections are to  be  in  August

1957 - then  is  the time we shall have to sit  down  to

weigh the position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Middle Road group (as they have been

called)  are  now in jail. They knew that  they  were

going to be nabbed. They knew it because the Hon. the

Chief  Minister's actions were so apparent. But  they

made  the Government pay the heaviest price for  that

retreat. And they are tough and resilient.  I  might

tell the Hon. the Chief Minister that the Member  for

Bukit Timah has asked me to convey his compliments to

the  Chief Minister and to express his thanks to  the

Hon. the Chief Secretary for the treatment he is  now

receiving in the Central Police Station as  a  V.I.P.

detainee. Let us assume for the sake of argument that

they are subversive characters. How long can you keep

them  there?  One  year, two years, four  years,  six

years? The Member for Bukit Timah is learning English

and  Malay.  I brought his father to see him  and  he

gave his father a list of books he was going to study

while  he  is  enjoying the comforts of  one  of  Her

Majesty's police stations. Amongst the books  are  an

English/Malay   dictionary  and  a   Malay/Chinese

dictionary. When he comes out, apart from speeches in

Hokkien  to  denounce the Chief  Minister  in  no  uncertain  terms,  it is not unlikely that,  given  the

teacher  companions in jail, he might be  denouncing

the Chief Minister in Malay and English too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the decisive turning point since the

elections. I would say this for my hon. opponents  on

the  other side of this House : they have decided  to

take

the  bull by the horns, and I wish them well. I  hope

they  will not be gored by the bull's horns.  Let  us

assume  that a thorough purge is carried  out  and  a

vacuum  is  created  amongst  the  workers  and   the

farmers. No more Farmers

Association. No more Factory and Shop Workers' Union.

What  happens next? There was a vacuum for six  years

from 1948 to 1954. The workers were unorganised,  the

farmers were unorganised

and nobody filled that vacuum. There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



were  trade  unionists like one Mr Peter  Williams

and some other people like him. But it was only the Malayan   Communist   Party   working   under   the

limitations  of  an  underground organisation  that

worked away like demons and built up a force  which

the Tunku and this present Government have to meet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fight for the loyalty of the people. We

all  talk of fighting to win over the masses,  but,

unfortunately,   we   are  all   amateurs   against

professional revolutionaries. We are not so  amateurish  now.  This is the challenge. If you  want  to

organise  the masses, you must find the  people  to

organise   them.   Masses  do   not   organise   by

themselves. Then you will come up against the  real crux  of  the problem. Can you find the organisers

and  get them on your side? The Marxists call  them

cadres.  Can you find the cadres? You lock up  one,

three  others spring up. You lock up three,  thirty

spring up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to ask "Why is the position like that?" It

is   because  of  two  factors:  first,  an  endemic

economic and social situation which brings  about  a

great  sense  of  grievance  against  society,   and

second,  the  appeal of an ideology  that,  theoretically,  provides the answers. I and  my  Party  have

lived  with this problem for the last two years.  If

we do not solve this problem, then I say, we perish.

It  will  not be solved just by using the  Societies

Ordinance  or  the  Banishment  Ordinance   or   the

Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance.   The

battle  is  a battle for organisers, for cadres.  To

win  these  people over to your side, you must  give

them  the  belief  of a just cause,  give  them  the

conviction  and the drive to work for a  better  and

happier society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not always have agreed with some of my

friends who are now in prison in Changi but I agreed

with  them on one thing : the determination to wreck

the present colonial system as soon as possible. For

I agreed with them that the colonial system is evil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the biggest tribute that this Government has

paid  to  these "subversive" characters is  to  have

tacitly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



admitted   that   only  300  people   had   organised

thousands of people in Singapore. The final battle in

this three-cornered fight - I am not speaking as a Party

politician - depends upon whether you can convince  the

people of Malaya, the people who are prepared to work

and fight, that the democratic State is the answer to

the  problems of Malaya. It you can convince them  of

it,  then you will get the intellectuals on your side -

the  persons  with the ability, the  conviction,  the

drive  and  integrity. And if you get  them  on  your

side, you win the battle. But if they go over to  the

other side, then you have lost the battle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government in making this purge had

misunderstood the power situation in Malaya.  It  is

not  their  expatriate colleagues in the Council  of

Ministers  who  decide the fate of Singapore.  Their

attitude   and  friendliness  do  not   decide   the

concessions  which  the British Government  will  or

will  not give. A Tory Britain with Sir Anthony Eden

as  Prime  Minister is not going to be  swayed  into

concessions by a friendly local nationalist group if

that group is a genuinely nationalist group? Do hon.

Members  on  the  other side  realise  that  a  Tory

Britain is today bombing Col. Nasser who is an anti-Communist?  It has nothing to do with  Communism  or

Democracy. It is concerned with preserving,  as  Sir

Anthony  Eden said, the way of life of  the  Western

people.  The  way of life of the Western  people  depends  on the oil wells in Arabia. If they lose  the

oil   wells,  there  will  be  five  million  people

unemployed  in Britain within one year.  When  those

are  the  stakes, Britain is not interested  in  pre

serving  the Middle East for the sake of  democracy.

Britain   is  interested  in  preserving   Britain's

economic interest and her way of life which  depends

on  those  economic interests. That was  the  Labour

Front's  tactical  miscalculation of  the  position.

There  should  never have been this  miscalculation.

But  the errors having been made, the least that the

Labour  Front can do is to bring these men to trial,

prove  the  charges  against them  and  satisfy  the

public conscience. It they cannot, then they have no

alternative but to release them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>3.59 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to second the motion before  the  House

because as an elected Assemblyman, a Nationalist  and

a Democrat, that is the only honest and logical thing

to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I stood for elections just over a year and a

half  ago, it was on the understanding that  I  would

fight for a self-governing, democratic Malaya.  That

was a solemn pledge given to my electorate and I have

not  forgotten it. I am not going to betray it today.

Certainly  when I stood for elections, I  never  told

the  voters that I would achieve merdeka if necessary

by the arbitrary arrests and detentions of my fellow-Singaporeans. I knew then that the achievement of merdeka  would  not be an easy task but I  never  for  a

moment thought that the price that would have  to  be

paid would

be  the  mass  arrests of trade unionists  and  civic

leaders and even an elected Assemblyman.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion before the House is in conformity with

the  spirit of the election pledges I made and  I  am

sure that a great many Members of this House made.  I

was pledged to fight against colonialism -
