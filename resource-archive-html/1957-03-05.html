<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>LONDON</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(March 1957)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's consent to move, and I do now hereby move the

motion standing in my name, namely,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the

recommendations of the All-Party Conference, as set

out in Sessional Paper No. Misc. 1 of 1957, and on the principles

therein set out instructs the All-Party Mission to

secure from Her Majesty's Government for the

people of Singapore the status of a self-governing

state with all the rights, powers, and privileges

thereto appurtenant in all internal affairs and

the control of trade, commerce and cultural

relations in external affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed any further, I would like to

draw the attention of hon. Members to an error on

page 3, paragraph 13 (c) , line 3 - the word "three"

should read "two".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the terms of the motion are clear. We are

seeking complete internal self-government and not

independence. We maintain and maintain with all

vigor that the people of Singapore have the

inalienable right to self-determination and to

deny them this right will be tantamount to a

breach of faith on the part of Her Majesty's

Government. We want to remain friends with

Britain, but our dignity as equals must be

recognized. A new chapter in the relationship between Britain and ourselves is being written and

this chapter can be a happy one of healthy and

fruitful co-operation if the Mission succeeds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other picture I hesitate to paint. But the

hand that holds the brush is not, in Singapore but

in London. The All-Party Mission to London is all

set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



to leave tomorrow on its quest for a new

Constitution for the people of Singapore. It seeks

sustenance from the unanimous support of the

people's representatives in this Assembly on the

principles enunciated in the White Paper, which is

its blueprint for a self-governing Singapore. The

Members of the All-Party Mission are drawn from

delegates to the All-Party Conference, and I take

heart from the unity of purpose displayed in the

conference that the All-Party Mission will be a

united force fully conscious of the task before

them and pledged to do their best for the people

of Singapore. The unity of our voice in this

Assembly on this national issue will provide the

fuel with which the All-Party Mission will steer

the ship, the "State of Singapore", safely into

port. I do not wish to give the impression that

all will be plain sailing. We are bound to

encounter rough weather, but we will not flounder

nor founder, for team-work will pull us through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not propose to go into detail on all the

items in the White Paper, as most of them are self-explanatory and do not require elucidation.

Moreover, the White Paper is the result of the

labours of the All-Party Conference and ten

Members of this Assembly have been closely

associated in its deliberations. On page 2,

paragraph 8, of the White Paper is the following

sentence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The conference's decision is that the All-Party

Mission will not accept anything less than what

had already been offered by the United Kingdom

Government."



<br><br>Sir, some uncharitable and uninformed people may

think that we are going to accept what the last

delegation had rejected. This is far from the

truth. We are pressing for a Malayan Governor-General, which proposal had not been accepted by

Her Majesty's Government during the last talks,

and the matter was still being examined by Her

Majesty's Government before the talks broke down.

We do not propose to accept the Defense and

Security Council offered by Her Majesty's

Government, and the line that the Mission will

take on this all-important issue is set out in

paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 on page 3 of the White

Paper. Apart from these two major issues, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



other recommendations can be found on pages 3 and

4 of the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 8, Sir, page 2, of the White Paper,

gives  details  of Her Majesty's proposals  during

the  last  talks  on  which  there  had  been   no

disagreement, and the line the Mission  will  take

in  London is that these proposals are accepted in

principle  and  that  the  discussion  should   be

confined to details only. Thus it can be seen that

the  blueprint  of  the All-Party  Mission  is  an

improvement   on  the  offers  of  Her   Majesty's

Government during the last talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Security Council proposed by us, the

set-up includes a Minister from the Federation  of

Malaya  with equal representation by the Singapore

Government and Her Majesty's Government. This  has

been made possible by the fine co-operation of the

Federation Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, and

I  would  like to express to him in this  Assembly

the thanks of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the bottom of page 2 of the White Paper,

the following appears:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proposal No. 23. Provision to be made for the

creation  of a Singapore citizenship on the  lines

of  the  proposal in paragraph 9 of the  Heads  of

Agreement  circulated by the Singapore  Delegation

(SCT. (56) 5)."



<br><br>Sir,  Her  Majesty's  Government  had  agreed   in

principle   to   the  creation  of   a   Singapore

citizenship  under  a  new  State  of   Singapore.

Whether  the citizenship rights should  come  into

force   before  the  creation  of  the  State   of

Singapore  or after was a question that confronted

the  All-Party  Conference. It was felt  that  the

people  affected  should enjoy  these  rights  and

exercise  their  votes in  the  choice  of  a  new

Government for the State of Singapore. To  achieve

this,  the  conference fully  realised  that  this

would  mean  that it would be impossible  for  the

general  elections to take place  in  August  this

year  to  which  the Government is committed.  The

British  Nationality Act will require an amendment

by the

British Parliament. Citizenship laws will have  to

be introduced in Singapore. A reasonable length of

time  of, say, one year should be given to persons

affected  to  make application if we  really  mean

them  to enjoy these rights. New electoral  rolls

will have to be prepared under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



the  Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance. All

these  take  time. I told the All-Party Conference

that  I  did  not wish to influence them  on  this

matter,  as I did not wish it to be said that  the

Government was seeking a way out of its promise to

hold elections in August this year. In view of the

great importance of the matter, the All-Party  Conference  felt  that the All-Party  Mission  should

seek  the  views of this Assembly  and  be  guided

accordingly. I would therefore ask hon. Members to

express  their views to guide us on  the  line  to

take  with  the Colonial Office on our citizenship

proposals.  The  Government  does  not  intend  to

ignore  its commitments, but is prepared to listen

to  the  views and advice of hon. Members. I  must

explain the reason that prompted the Government to

announce  that it would hold elections  in  August

this year under the new Constitution to be secured

from  Her Majesty's Government. Hon. Members  will

recollect  that  the Government took  firm  action

against  subversive  elements last  September  and

October.  This  imposed and is  still  imposing  a

great  strain on my colleagues and me. This  is  a

heavy  responsibility, but we are not deterred  by

it. While we are in office, we mean to govern, and

govern  in  the  best interests of the  people  of

Singapore.  Under the circumstances, I  felt  that

the   Labour  Front  Coalition  should  face   the

electorate  as  soon  as possible  under  the  new

constitution to ascertain whether the  action  the

Government has taken has the support of the people

of  Singapore. In fact, the machinery has  already

been  set in motion to prepare electoral rolls  on

the  basis of the present franchise, and  it  had

been in my mind that as soon as agreement had been

reached  in  London,  I would  seek  an  immediate

amendment to the Order in Council to give legality

to  the  electoral rolls which would  be  awaiting

publication.  I find it imperative that  I  should

say this now to protect the Government against any

malicious charges that may be levied in the future

should  the views of this Assembly necessitate  an

enforced delay in holding the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, is in favor of giving every

opportunity to all persons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



who  will acquire citizenship rights to have a say

in  the  choice of a new government under the  new

Constitution.  But  in view  of  the  Government's

commitment to hold elections in August this  year.

the  Government will abide by the  views  of  hon.

Members.   If  the  consensus  of  view   is   for

citizenship rights to be introduced ahead of  the

new  Constitution,  then  the  responsibility  for

delaying  the general elections should  rest  with

this  Assembly, and the Government should  not  be

blamed    for    postponing   it.   Under    these

circumstances, the date of coming  into  force  of

the  new Constitution will have to be synchronized

with the date of the general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the All-Party Conference considered the

joint  memorandum  received  by  me  from  certain

communal  organizations, and came to the unanimous

conclusion   that  the  provision  of   specially

reserved  seats  for sectional interests  was  not

acceptable  to  our  concept of  a  fully  elected

legislature under our constitutional proposals for

a State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An official invitation was received from the

Secretary of State inviting Members of the Mission

to  be guests of Her Majesty's Government from the

date  of  the  Mission's  arrival  in  the  United

Kingdom until the end of the conference.

We  are  indeed  very grateful  to  Her  Majesty's

Government for this hospitality, and I trust  that

while we are enjoying it, we will be able to drink

from the cup of success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to speak at great length, Sir,

nor  do I wish to take this opportunity to make  a

pre-election speech. The fight is not here but  in

London. I would therefore ask the Members  of  the

Mission to conserve their energy, play their  part

well  and  strive  to maintain  that  exhilarating

unity which has been displayed by them in the All-Party  Conference. Let our thoughts  be  calm  and

collected,  and let us go with hope in our  hearts

and no ill words on our lips.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to quote some

lines from the great Indian poet Tagore, which  it

seems  to me define our sense of high endeavor  in

face



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



of the next stage of our political development:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the mind is without fear and the head is

held high;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where knowledge is free;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the world has not been broken into

fragments by narrow domestic walls;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where words come out from the depths of truth;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the clear stream of reason has not lost

its  way  in  the  dreary desert  sand  of  dead

habit;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my

country awake!



<br><br>10.22 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as a Member of  the  All-Party

Conference,  I  rise  to  second  the  motion.  In

Singapore, at the last elections, we had had  many

people shouting about merdeka. I think that was  a

misnomer.  All that we asked for during last  year

until now was just self-government. The people  of

Singapore of course want to govern themselves,  to

run  their  own  affairs,  to  be  an  independent

people,  to be proud that they are able to  handle

what should be their own rights. Responsibility in

this  matter must be shown to the world at  large,

and the people of Singapore today have shown that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of independence or self-government, we must not only be able to do the

cushy   jobs   in   offices  and   do   just   the

administrative part of it, but also must  be  able

to  rise  to  the  occasion and to  sacrifice  our

property  and  our  lives  if  necessary,  in  the

interests  of  the country. Today, the  newspapers

report  that young men of Singapore are  conscious

of   that.   The  registration  of  the  Singapore

Regiment  is  ample  proof  that  the  people   of

Singapore   are   ready   to   shoulder    greater

responsibility. They are enthusiastic  in  joining

this  new  Singapore Regiment, which will  be  the

nucleus  of  a  band  of  people  devoted  to  the

country,   and  will  lay  down  their  lives   if

necessary  to defend this country. This  is  solid

proof  to  the  world that we want self-government

not only because it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



brings in the good things, but also we are able to

defend  ourselves and take on more of the  onerous

duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines drawn up by the All-Party Conference

and  the  demands  that we are going  to  make  in

London  are  well  known  in  Singapore.  I  think

everybody has accepted them. We had more  or  less

the  same lines last year but we failed. We failed

because of one thing

- man  had  put self-interest first, party interest

again  in the fore, and national interests at  the

bottom.  I  think  today  all  Members  of   every

political  party realize that the  first  interest

must  be  national interest. We go today, Sir,  as

one  unit  with one aim, and that aim is  that  we

will fight first and foremost and every time,  for

national  interests. We will do  away  with  party

interests.  That  will come  only  after  we  have

achieved our national aspirations, and I think  we

all  realize that in a community like  this,  self

should be put last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I think we are going to London with

some experience. We have before us the mistakes we

committed  last year, where one party  shouted  at

another  party,  ridiculed  another  party,  in  a

foreign land; so much so that our opposite numbers

could  pierce through our armor very  easily,  too

easily, and we came back empty-handed. This  time,

we  realize that mistake and I think we  will  not

commit that same error again. We will bring  back,

as somebody said, the bacon to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demands that we have are realistic. We know

our  limits.  We know how far we  can  go  and  we

demand just the minimum that we should have, and I

think  we  will have that. We have the support  of

the   people   behind  us  solidly.  Everyone   in

Singapore  has  come to realize that  this  is  an

important  issue  and that everyone  in  Singapore

supports  this Mission to the full. With  the  support  of the people, the United Kingdom Government

will realise that they are not dealing with a band

of  five people, but are dealing with a whole mass

of 1,250,000 people in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must say that whatever we ask for

this time is only just one step



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



forward.  We  are only asking for self-government.

We  are  not  asking  for merdeka,  but  Singapore

cannot  stop at that. As the former Chief Minister

said,  we must grow up, we must make our mistakes,

we  must fall down, we must pick ourselves up  and

we  must learn by the hard way, but I think we are

taking  every precaution not to fall and hurt  ourselves so much that we end up in the mortuary.  We

will  learn to walk, we will learn to run, but  we

will  take every step to see that whatever we  do,

we grow from strength to strength.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next step, of course, will be the real

merdeka, as the word should signify, and  we  want

it  to  be  as  soon as possible.  Sir,  you  will

realize that from the Sessional Paper No. Misc.  1

of  1957, we are going there to negotiate with the

United  Kingdom for self-government but, within  a

time  limit  of four years, we must go back  again

and  negotiate for real independence. The time may

come  earlier. It may be just three years or  two,

and  I  know that as soon as we know our strength,

as  soon as we know that we are fully equipped for

independence, we  will go and  ask  for  it.  The

people  of Singapore must work towards this  goal,

and  I know that it will be soon enough it all  of

us pull our weight together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a few timid people in

Singapore  who  are afraid of merdeka.  They  make

representations, they voice their opinions in  the

newspapers and say that they do not want  merdeka.

These  consist only of a very small section of  the

people. They are afraid to come out of their  cosy

holes. They are afraid that things might go wrong.

But  we  have before us our great neighbor, India.

She has come out and become an independent nation.

She  is  today one of the leading nations  in  the

world.  Everything that is done there is  peaceful

and  progressive,  and we know that  we  certainly

will  follow that great brother through that  road

of independence and progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister mentioned that the Government

promised  the people elections during  August.  We

realize that it is not possible to have elections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



at  that time if we are going to give the right of

vote  to  the  200,000 people who are eligible  to

become  Singapore citizens. This section of people

forms  a  very  important part of Singapore.  They

have  contributed  a great deal  to  the  good  of

Singapore. They are as loyal to Singapore  as  the

local-born. And these people should be  given  the

vote. However, if we are going to achieve that, as

the Chief Minister said, this takes time. We agree

with him that this takes time, but we say that the

time  taken  should be cut down to a  minimum  and

that  elections  should be held  at  the  earliest

possible  moment. Time must be budgetted  so  that

these people have the vote, and that elections can

be held as early as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow we go to London with the unity of

purpose and I know that we will succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to support the motion  before  this

House. We all gave our consent to this motion.  We

all  agreed  with the White Paper now  before  the

Assembly.  I think the terms of the motion  is  an

indication of the great difference this time  from

last  time.  I  do not claim any credit  for  this

particular  resolution, in fact I had very  little

to  do  with  it.  But I did look  up  the  former

resolution. The House will forgive me if I were to

remind  them  of the terms of the resolution  they

passed  on the 5th April last year. The resolution

first opens with a flourish by a reference to  the

Washington Declaration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, it

said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly, affirms in the name of

the  people of Singapore, its belief  in  the

principle  of 'the basic right of peoples  to

governments  of  their  own  choice',  as  enunciated   in   the  Washington   Declaration

signed  by  Sir Anthony Eden, Prime  Minister

of  the  United Kingdom" (now politically  deceased)  "and President Eisenhower, President

of  the United States of America, on the  1st

of February, 1956",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



and so on, and winds up by saying:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . to seek forthwith for Singapore the status

of    an   independent   territory    within   the

Commonwealth,  and to offer" (mark you  the  word,

Mr   Speaker, 'offer')  "an  agreement   and   the

Singapore  Government of the United Kingdom  would

in  respect  of  Singapore exercise  control  over

external  defence  and give  guidance  in  foreign

relations other than trade and commerce."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were fierce words and, I am sorry to say,

they  did  not materialize. Looking  back  now,  I

thought - like  when the platform collapsed  at  the

famous  rally at Kallang - it was a symbolic act  of

unwisdom of people who did not prepare the  ground

before they climbed on the platform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is all past history. We go again this

time,  as the Member for Serangoon has said, with  more

experience.  He will not this time be so  befuddled  by

the London traffic, nor by the habits of the people  of

London. Like other members of the former delegation had

they returned, he would have gone back as a connoisseur

of  London  café life. But the Member for Serangoon  is

the  one man who, although we very often disagree  with

his  political views, we respect for the sincerity with

which he holds them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This merdeka conference has been so completely quiet

and different from the last. There is no warming up  as

there  was  the  last time. My Party  thought  that  we

should at least have one rally before we depart. And in

case  we are accused of wanting to demonstrate our  own

strength and mass support, we suggested that we  should

hold  an  all-party  rally. But the consternation  with

which  this  suggestion  was received  led  us  to  the

conclusion  that  perhaps, for the  sake  of  all-party

unity,  we  should  depart  with  as  little  noise  as

possible. I hope this time, though, when we return with

or without success, we shall return with a bang and not

with  a  damp  squib  of a noise with  which  the  last

mission returned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is no secret that we have not only reached

agreement  to ask for what we have stated in the  White

Paper in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



clear  and precise terms, namely, no more than complete

internal self-government. It is also no secret that  we

have  reached  agreement to take united action  if  the

talks  should fail. But I do not think that the chances

of  failure are high. This London Conference will be an

anti-climax after the last one. This time, we go  there

with our demands more clearly defined and soberly,  but

firmly pressed. Last time there was some uncertainty as

to   what  exactly  we  were  asking  for.  There  were

occasions  when I heard it mooted that we  should  join

the  United Nations because if we get independence  and

then   we  give  back  certain  powers  and  privileges

connected with defense and foreign relations, we should

be  eligible to join the United Nations. I am glad that

this time all parties agree that what we are asking for

is  no more than complete internal self-government, and

we  are  telling the people of Singapore so  before  we

leave  so that no one can say that we have not put  the

facts before them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party's stand on this matter is quite clear. My

Party  says if we want independence we must get  merger

with  the Federation. This is as far as we can go until

merger. The next is merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that I believe the coming talks will succeed. I

give  these  following reasons for it: three  from  the

Singapore  point of view and the same  three  from  the

British  point of view. First from the Singapore  point

of  view,  our clearly defined demands present  to  the

British  something  which  guarantees  their  paramount

military  and  strategic needs, and, at the  same  time

give  us  adequate  room  for  full  internal  control.

Second,  there is more sense of cohesion  in  the  All-Party  Conference and, I hope, in the delegation. Also,

this  conference will be led by someone less  emotional

and  flamboyant than our last leader. I am  not  saying

that  emotion  and flamboyance have not played  in  the

development of nations. But we discovered from the last

conference that they were not necessarily the qualities

which  brought  success  at the conference  table.  The

third reason is that the British Government knows  that

if  this time it fails, we are agreed on united  action

when we return.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three reasons looked at from the British point

of view mean, first, that the British have now a better

appraisal  of how much less than full independence  she

is giving away. Second, they have a better appraisal of

the  position of the Federation Minister in the defence

known  as  the Security Council in the ratio of  three,

three, one. It may well be that as Mr Lennox-Boyd indicated at the last talks some arrangements may have been

reached  between  Her  Majesty's  Government  and   the

Federation Government in their defence treaty about the

member  from  the  Federation  who  will  sit  on  this

Security  Council of Singapore. But whatever the  inner

workings  of the defence treaty, it is clear  that  the

British Government finds it now palatable, when it  was

not last year. Thirdly, the same third reason looked at

from  the  British point of view is that last time  all

that happened was we changed Chief Ministers. This time

it  is  not  likely  that  the Labour  Front  Coalition

Government  will survive a defeat of these  talks.  The

Hon. the  Chief  Minister will remember  that  he  has

promised  to  resign if these talks fail. Try  how  one

will,  I  do  not see how, out of this Assembly  of  32

persons;  one  could  form another Government  if  this

Government  resigns. Consequently, I consider  we  have

more  chances of success than we had the last  time.  I

personally  anticipate some difficulty on two  matters:

one,  the  question of the expatriate judges and  their

tenure  of  office; two, the position of the  Governor-General. We do not want to cross our bridges before  we

come to them. The stand of the All-Party delegation  is

quite clear and it is in the White Paper. We intend  to

have  our own Judiciary as soon as possible. We  intend

to  have  the  power  to remove judges  who  have  been

appointed by the Colonial Legal Service as and when  we

have  the men who can fill their roles. The fight  over

the  Governor-General has become  so  acute  since  the

U.M.N.O.'s  demand  as  to  who  should  be  the  first

Governor-General that I do not think anybody now  would

want to let that plum go.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are glad that, in spite of all

our trials and tribulations, and threats  of

desertions  from the All-Party  Conference,

we  have settled our differences and we hope

to  go  to London as an effective unit.  The

question which must more engage the minds of

the  people  of  Singapore is  what  happens

after  the conference if it succeeds.  There

are  two  phases  of what  happens  after  a

successful  conference.  The  immediate  one

will  open with the new elections under  the

new constitution. The long-term one is where

we go to from now to get freedom



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had never believed that there were

going  to  be  elections in August.  When  I

heard  the Member for Cairnhill (Mr  D.  S.

Marshall)  chasing like a terrier after  his

former Labour Minister to pin him down to  a

date  for elections, I knew that the promise

of  elections  by August was not  one  which

could  be  fulfilled unless one dropped  the

citizenship  proposals. We were silent  then

because  we  wanted to know to  what  extent

internal  contradictions within  the  Labour

Front  could  wreck  the Government  of  the

Labour  Front. We watched with  considerable

interest  the developments of these internal

contradictions and we are sorry  today  that

the Member for Cairnhill is not here to give

us  his blessings. We were the first to  ask

for   elections - in  fact,  we  asked  the

Government  to face an election  at  a  time

when  the Government thought it was ungentlemanly  to  ask  it to do so. Once  elections

were  not  held  then, any  student  of  the

Singapore  political scene could have  added

two and two together to say that there would

be  no  elections in 1957 because one cannot

get  a  new  constitution  and  prepare  new

electoral registers by 1957 unless,  as  the

Hon. the Chief Minister has put it, we  use

the  old  electoral  registers.  That  is  a

suggestion  which is bound to be unpalatable

and  bound  to create the greatest consternation  and  opposition from so many  quarters

that have long agitated for citizenship. The

decision  of  my Party is that  the  reputed

200,000  people who would have the right  to

vote  under the new citizenship laws  should

be  put  on  the  register before  the  next

elections. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



the length of time required to allow them to

register  and  to prepare the new  electoral

rolls  is  a  matter  which  requires   more

consideration.   The  Chief   Minister   has

mentioned  the  period  of  one   year   for

registration  for citizenship, which  means,

in  effect,  one year plus a  period  of  at

least   three   further   months   for   the

preparation of the registers. I do not think

that   we  have  carefully  considered   all

aspects  of  this administrative problem.  I

would leave my Party free on the question of

the  length of time for the time  being.  We

will   have  to  discuss  this  matter  more

carefully to see whether it can be done more

expeditiously  and  more  quickly.  But,  on

principle, we agree that they should  be  on

the register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next election is bound to be more far-reaching in consequences. It may wreck the

present Government as the last elections did

the Progressive Party, because two important

alterations  to conditions of the  political

arena   have   been   agreed   to,   namely,

multilingualism  and Singapore  citizenship.

But  whatever  Government  is  elected  into

power  in the next elections under  the  new

constitution,   it   faces   two   important

limitations.  First, any policy  it  carries

out  which  brings  on  the  rancor  of  the

Federation  Government can be  countered  by

economic   sanctions   by   the   Federation

Government. We all know what has happened to

the  attempts  of the Minister for  Commerce

and  Industry  to get the tax  on  soap  and

biscuits  lifted. That is just the beginning

of  new trends which are bound to emerge  as

the  two  Governments become more  and  more

distinct  in their outlook and their  political  identities. No Singapore Government can

carry  out  a fiscal policy which  conflicts

with  that of the Federation without  strong

economic  sanctions  being  imposed.  It  is

impossible  to  carry  out  a  revolutionary

Socialist  programme  in  Singapore  if  the

Federation Government is of the opinion that

that  is bad for the Federation and it  does

not  wish  to  pursue  a  similar  programme

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second limitation which may not be so

immediate  but is nonetheless  real  is  the

political    sanction    under    the    constitution - suspension;  and  there  will   be

enough   British  military  forces  in   the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



country  to  make  suspension  of  the   constitution  a  practical  proposition.   The

consequences  of a suspension  may  be  far-reaching but any Government in power at  the

next elections would be dishonest if it  did

not  tell the people beforehand that it will

have,  although  there is complete  internal

freedom,  those  two  limitations   on   its

independence  of  action  within   Singapore

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this new constitution, we come to the

end  of  one phase of the fight for freedom.

The  Member  for  Serangoon (Mr  Lim  Choon

Mong)  said that we should prepare and fight

on  for merdeka but he did not mention  how.

Presumably, one day when all the  people  of

Singapore   have  decided  that  they   want

merdeka,  not  internal self-government, we

will  all shout for merdeka and we will send

another All-Party delegation. In the context

of the second half of the 20th century South-East  Asia, island  nations  are  political

jokes.  If we want to get freedom, there  is

no  other way out. Let us face the fact that

we  must make it palatable to the Federation

to  help us in order to help itself. That is

the   second   phase  after   the   expected

successful conclusion of the next talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the Tunku and perhaps a

number  of his colleagues are against merger

in   no  uncertain  terms, and  they   have

repeatedly said so. I sincerely believe that

they   are   misguided  in  believing   that

separation is the lesser of two evils. It is

not  said by the Federation Government  that

merger  is bad itself. All they say is  that

because  of certain consequences of  merger,

they  would rather not have one.  Sir,  the

Tunku  said that for as long as he is  Chief

Minister there would be no merger. So unless

he  changes his mind, it appears to us  that

we  will  have to wait till we  have  a  new

Chief   Minister  or  perhaps  a  new  Prime

Minister.  But without wishing  to  say  any

thing  about  the internal politics  of  the

Federation, I would hate to believe that the

leaders  of  the  political Parties  in  the

Federation  are  unable to see  that  it  is

better  to  have Singapore as  part  of  the

Federation and under Federation control than

outside the Federation and outside its political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



or  military  control.  For  the  only

control   the  Federation  can   have   over

Singapore  is,  as  I  have  mentioned,   an

indirect    economic   one.   A    Singapore

Government which is prepared to run economic

hazards   can   embarrass   the   Federation

Government  no end. In fact on one  occasion

the  Tunku said that, if necessary, he would

send  troops to occupy Singapore. I think  I

am  right  in my recollection that he  would

send troops, if necessary. Sir, would it not

be   better  to  have  us  as  part  of  the

Federation   under  the   control   of   the

Federation  without having the necessity  to

send  troops to invade and conquer?  We  are

offering  to go into the Federation  and  we

still should offer to go in

as  a  unitary state in the Federation which

means  that  no  balance  of  power  in  the

Federation  would be radically upset.  I  am

convinced  that  whatever  happens  to   the

personalities  involved in  the  leadership,

the  leadership itself must come to  realize

that  the new Federation cannot depend  upon

the  British to keep Singapore under control

to prevent it from being an embarrassment to

the  Federation. So long as the British have

troops   here  and  can  use  those   troops

effectively, Singapore can, militarily, from

the point of view of the shooting war in the

Federation,  be  kept under control  and  in

line  with  the  Federation's  tactics   and

methods.  But these leaders must  understand

that   the   nationalist  feeling   in   the

Federation  and the political  consciousness

of  their people of the evils of colonialism

are  bound to rise more and more to make the

Federation  more  like  Egypt  than  Persia.

Muslim countries like Jordan with a King  as

its   head  have  already  written  off  the

British  army  together with  General  Gluhb

Pasha. We are confident that the leaders  of

the  Federation will understand this, if not

now,  in the not too distant future. We look

forward  to the day when there will  be  men

with  vision and political grasp, fired  by

ideals  to make this whole region now  known

as  Singapore and the Federation  of  Malaya

one nation. We know that there are proposals

to include the

Borneo territories. Let them come in at some

future date, if they will, for

after  all, we lose nothing by having, more

territories to expand into. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



let our two territories get together as soon

as  possible before vested interests in  the

two  separate independent States become more

deep-rooted  and make merger and unification

more difficult than it is at present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say to the Federation Government that

we  wish  it  all success with  its  merdeka

which  is to come soon. But we hope that  it

will hold the door open to us to join it  in

the  not  too  distant future on  terms  and

conditions which ensure that there  will  be

no radical change of political forces in the

Federation  by Singapore joining  it.  I  am

convinced that, but for the repeated refusal

to  consider  merger, the  Singapore  Malays

would  not  have  raised  the  question   of

special  rights  and privileges  this  time.

They  did not the last time. It is this fear

of being cut off from the main population of

Malays  in  Malaya, the fear of the  200,000

Malays  in  Singapore of not being  able  to

enjoy  the protection and comfort  of  being

part  of  the  three million people  in  the

Federation,  together with  all  the  unrest

that  took place last year, that has alarmed

them  and  hence  this  demand  for  special

rights.  Special rights they will  have  but

even  more so when they join the Federation.

So, we ask them, on behalf of the people  of

Singapore, to press for merger.



<br><br>11.01 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar took the words out of my mouth when he

made the remark about the difference in  the

atmosphere. I was also going to say, "What a

difference between last year and now!" There

is  now  no tenseness, no anxiety among  the

public,  and even in this House  itself,  we

can  feel  the  calmness and the  confidence

with  which  we are going to face  the  All-Party talks in London.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday evening, at the conclusion of

the   All-Party  Conference,  the   People's

Action  Party  made  a  suggestion  that  we

should  have  another rally. All  the  other

Parties, having had the experience  of  last

year, poured  millions of gallons  of  cold

water to drown that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



suggestion.  We  know  what  they  mean   by

"warming up". They were responsible for  the

organisation last year. They said that there

would  be no trouble but when in the process

of warming up, trouble and fire started, the

leaders were not there. Somebody else had to

do  the dirty job of putting down the  fire.

Should we now this year risk the success  of

our  conference in London by holding a silly

rally? Is it necessary to have these rallies

when  we  are going to London with  all  the

confidence and the assurance that  we  shall

succeed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the August elections, we are

realists.   If   we  have  to   postpone   a

commitment to an election because we have to

give 200,000 people the right to vote as and

when  they are granted such right under  the

new constitution, then we say, "Postpone the

elections."  Of course, there  should  be  a

limit  to the period for postponement and  I

agree  that  we should all get together  and

see  that the least possible time should  be

taken;  but  when you offer the people, who

have  lived  here  for  ten  years  and  are

prepared  to  take an oath of allegiance  to

the  State, the right to vote, are you going

to  keep them for another four or five years

to  eat the cake that is offered to them?  I

say   no.  They  should,  as  soon  as   the

constitution is granted, be allowed to  make

their choice of the type of government  they

want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Mission leaves our shores confident of

success,  because we know  exactly  what  we

shall ask for, no more, no less. There  will

be  no bickering, bargaining, or attempts to

get  a  little bit more, which was the cause

of last year's failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I must say that the failure was not

without  its lessons. It has taught us  that

in  the  governing of a State, there  is  no

room for emotionalism, excitement and drama.

These    things   only   bring    confusion,

uncertainty  and disorder. It has  shown  us

that calmness, reasonableness and confidence

is  what  Singapore wants, to prove that  we

are ready to be masters of our own fate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish our delegates on this All Party

Mission  god speed and success and to  bring

us a new constitution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



granting  us  self-government as  a  step  towards

independence within the Commonwealth.



<br><br>11.08 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I think it is hardly  necessary

for  me  to  add my support to this motion  which,

after all, is based on the recommendations of  the

All-Party Conference of which I am a member, and I

think  it is neither necessary for me to elaborate

the  merits or demerits of its contents which  are

more or less similar to the points which have been

agreed   by  all  Parties  and  by  Her  Majesty's

Government  with the exception of the  composition

of  the  Security Council and the question of  the

judiciary  which  has been ably explained  by  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar this morning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are few points to which I should

like to draw the attention of the delegates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and most important point is the

question of citizenship. Although the question  of

the  qualification of citizenship has been  agreed

by the Parties concerned and in the talks with Her

Majesty's Government in London last April,  it  is

the  question  of implementation that  I  wish  to

touch  upon.  I  am sure all the Members  in  this

House  will  agree with me that it  is  imperative

that  those who will obtain citizenship under  the

new  constitution should be allowed to vote in the

coming  election, although it will mean the  delay

of  the election date. In case there is anyone who

is  still doubtful of the advisability of granting

citizenship or its early implementation,  I  would

like  to draw his attention to the fact that these

200,000  people who had come to Singapore,  mostly

in their younger days, have helped to build up the

prosperity of this country. With the exception  of

the British, they control most of the big concerns

in Singapore today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what a precarious position Singapore

would  be placed in if these 200,000 people, whose

loyalty  has  always  been to this  country,  were

forced   by  political  reasons  or  circumstances

beyond their control to change their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



loyalty to another country which may be hostile to

Singapore,  or  to an ideology  which  it  is  the

policy of this country to suppress. In saying this

I  am  not doubting their loyalty to this country.

In  fact, in the last war with the Japanese, many

of  them, although they held no franchise in  this

country, had  readily laid down  their  lives  to

defend it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the request by the non-political and communal associations. I am glad

that  the  All-Party Conference have  turned  down

their  request.  Since they are non-political:  or

communal,  as the name implies, what do they  want

seats in the Assembly for? Why do they not dare to

come  out and contest the elections? It is because

they  know  they  represent no one but  themselves

that  they  have,  as usual,  to  crawl  to  their

colonial masters to get them reserved seats in the

Assembly  so that they may feel more dignified  to

give  parties to incoming and departing governors.

If   the   question  is  raised  by  the  Colonial

Secretary  in  London, I hope the  delegates  will

remind  him  that this is unnecessary because  the

next Governor-General will be a Malayan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is the early implementation of

the  question of citizenship. I hope the delegates

will  discuss  with Her Majesty's  Government  the

early implementation of citizenship so as to avoid

undue  delay in the coming elections, even  before

the  constitution comes into force. With all  this

goodwill and unity before us today, I am sure this

Mission will be a success.



<br><br>11.14 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion and wish

success to the Hon. the Chief Minister and his All-Party  team in the coming talks. Sir, our  demand,

as  laid down in the White Paper, is for a limited

merdeka, that is, internal self-government.  Sir,

internal  self-government means that  within  your

own  city you control your finances and carry  out

things  in  such a manner as if you run  your  own

house.  It  does  not give us  freedom  to  decide

external or foreign affairs or defence, and  I  am

sure the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>



United  Kingdom Government will accept our suggestions.

They cannot refuse such moderate demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after we have succeeded in obtaining our demands,

our  status  will be much lower than our former  sister

colonies like Penang and Malacca. They are full-fledged

independent territories, but we will not be so. On  the

other  hand, to ask for independence as we did  in  the

last  mission, it could not have been possible for  the

United  Kingdom to grant us that because of Singapore's

strategic position in relation to the defence of  their

own economic position and also vis-a-vis Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Member for Tanjong Pagar has,

by experience, become reasonable and has toned down his

demands to accept a limited merdeka. Now he understands

that  you cannot get independence immediately. You have

got  to  go  step by step. India has done  that.  Other

countries  have done that, and I am glad that  he  sees

reason!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore cannot stand on its own feet

economically   without   the   co-operation   of    the

Federation.  The  tariffs  imposed  by  the  Federation

against  Singapore's  products will  not  make  our  industries flourish at all. If we have to compete in  the

open  market, then we will not be able to compete  with

foreign  imports.  Singapore stands on  entrepot  trade

only and that should be protected at all costs. But the

easiest  way  to get independence is to say immediately

"Yes"  to the Federation. Join them and you will become

straightaway free and independent. It will  be  then  a

united  country  including  Singapore, and  will  then

negotiate with the United Kingdom about defence or  the

strategic  position of Singapore and  how  much  rights

they should have over here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the election issue, both the leaders on this

side of the House have expressed that it should not  be

delayed beyond what is necessary, and this question can

well  be  discussed after the success  of  the  merdeka

mission. It is no use arguing now. The machinery can be

worked out later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I wish all success to the All-Party Delegation and hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>

they will return very early after attaining success.



<br><br>11.19 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, once again.

we  gather in this House today to give our blessing  to

the  Merdeka Mission which leaves for London. Naturally

our  thoughts inevitably turn to that first visit  when

the forces for freedom were, as it were, marshalled for

a  mass  assault  on the Secretary  of  State  for  the

Colonies.  That was a historic event that  now  rightly

belongs to history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mission to London, Sir, is led by the Chief

Minister  who is no Napoleon Bonaparte! He  is  a  very

cautious man who makes sure that the horse is going  to

win  before he puts his shirt on it! For one thing, the

present  mission is a very small one.  This  at  least

will  make  for greater manoeuvrability. Secondly,  the

mission has, as it were, a stronger merdeka platform to

sustain  it than was the case the last time.  At  least

there  is a greater measure of unity about the  demands

that  are to be made in London. These demands, Sir,  do

not go as far as some of us would wish, but this is the

price  that has to be paid in the interests  of  inter-Party  unity.  The  timid have come  a  little  further

forward than they were prepared to, and the bolder ones

have retreated a little to meet them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the Federation towards unity with

Singapore  has also imposed limitations on  Singapore's

political  demands. An independent, sovereign Singapore

can  be  realised  only  as  part  of  an  independent,

sovereign  Malaya.  These therefore are  the  necessary

limitations under which the second Merdeka  Mission  to

London  must  work.  These are  limitations  which  the

Parties have accepted. Some Members of the Assembly may

feel  that  the demands go too far and others  not  far

enough.  However, Sir, in the interests of unity, they

have  reached agreement on what the mission should  ask

for.  I  hope,  Sir, that this time  the  mission  will

maintain  a  solid  front during  the  negotiations  in

London. I hope, too,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>



that  there  will be no retreat on  these  minimum

demands. We should try and get more if we can, but

there should be no back door deals to get less or,

worse  still, attempts to sabotage the forthcoming

talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also warn the mission that this second

mission  must  not fail? The first  failure  ended

fortunately  in  nothing more  disastrous  than  a

change  of Chief Ministers. If we fail this  time,

we  cannot afford and we cannot meet the situation

by  changing Chief Ministers again! It could  well

result  in  consequences far  too  serious  to  be

solved by expediencies of this sort. Perhaps, Sir,

if  they  keep this warning in mind, and  if  they

preserve  their solidarity in London,  the  second

mission  need not flop. Sir, I join in wishing  it

good luck.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, today is a red letter-day  for

Singapore.  Today we debate the motion before  the

House  in  a  spirit  of  calmness,  goodwill  and

confidence and there is also that unity of purpose

to  achieve  what  we set out  to  do.  The  Chief

Minister  has rightly quoted from that noted  poet

"Let  my  country awake." Let us be awake  to  the

implications and the task that lie before us. When

we achieve self-government, all of us, everyone in

Singapore,  have  got to make sacrifices  for  the

sake   of   the  country  and  to  place  national

interests before self. We must be able to practise

selflessness,   patient  co-operation   with   all

communities  and exercise in a sense  of  goodwill

whatever policy the Government sets out to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the postponement of the elections

from  August to a later date, my Party's stand  on

this  question  is to agree to the  views  of  the

majority  and,  as  a  Member  of  the  Government

myself,  I think I have the blessing of the  Chief

Minister to say that the Government is not willing

and will not remain one day earlier than necessary

for  the  elections to be held at a later date  to

enable  the  200,000  odd people,  who  have  made

Singapore  their  home and  the  object  of  their

loyalty,  the right to vote. Obviously  they  must

have the right to vote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>



and  choose the government they want, and for that

purpose  I think we must allow them time to  apply

for citizenship under the new constitution and  to

have  their right to vote the people they want  to

run the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a member of the delegation to London, I

have  this to say: that I am very glad indeed that

all  the  Party leaders represented in this  House

have expressed their sincerity of purpose and that

they   will   go   with  sincerity   and   without

participating in party politics in London.



<br><br>11.26 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, many references have been  made

to Party leaders but no mention has ever been made

to  Independents in this Assembly. When I  made  a

statement regarding my claim for inclusion in  the

All-Party   Conference,  there  was   a   lot   of

misapprehension  in the minds of  the  public  and

even some Members of this Assembly that it was  my

intention  to obtain a free ticket to  the  United

Kingdom.  This  was  entirely  wrong.  I  had   no

intention of going to the United Kingdom and  what

I  wanted at that time was to be consulted at  the

All-Party  Conference  so that  this  White  Paper

today  could claim the support of the people's  representatives in this Assembly. Unfortunately  the

five  Independents were left out. It is a surprise

to  me, Sir, that the Member for Pasir Panjang has

said   that   non-political  people  or   communal

organizations have claimed reserved seats in  this

Assembly. As far as I am aware, there has not been

any  member of a non-political Party who has asked

for a reserved seat. The five Independents who are

represented in this Assembly fought the  elections

and  they  were  elected to this Assembly  by  the

people and they did not come to this Assembly as a

result of reserved seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion of a national issue such as this,

which  is  of  great importance to the  people  of

Singapore, should have been open to all Members of

this  Assembly  so  that a full mandate  could  be

given to the delegation which is leaving for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>



London.  The Chief Minister at one time said  that

we  could  easily have the matter debated  in  the

Assembly  today,  but  it  was  only  until   late

yesterday that this White Paper was circulated  to

Members of the Assembly. At the time when the All-Party  Conference was held and if the Independents

had  been  invited to the conference, it might  be

that  there  would be no occasion at all  to  have

this  sitting today, and the Chief Minister, after

unanimous  agreement, could  have  given  a  Press

release  of  the  issue. I fully  appreciate  that

political  Party Members here are bound  by  Party

discipline  and Independent Members  are  free  to

speak  whatever they like, but the Chief  Minister

must  also  realise that in Singapore there  is  a

large section which do not belong to any political

Party and the only way in which they could express

their views is through the elected representatives

who  are  not Members of any political  Party,  so

that  they could be represented also. Such people,

as  I have always said, are citizens of the colony

and  I cannot see any reason why they should  have

no  interest in the welfare of this country. It is

for  this  reason that I had asked for  representations  for  inclusion in the All-Party Conference.

Whatever  it may be, Sir, the whole thing  is  now

finished. A White Paper has been tabled and  I  do

not  think  it  is fair that I should  pursue  the

matter  further.  The  All-Party  Conference  have

completed  their findings and today  we  have  the

result  of their deliberations in the White  Paper

that is before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when I claimed inclusion in the

conference, there was another crisis raised by the

U.M.N.O., and today I am glad that the U.M.N.O. is

quite happy and that they have now nominated their

delegate to the mission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the eve of the departure of this

delegation  to  London,  and  I  think,   in   the

interests  of  the  people of  Singapore  and  the

colony itself, I should give my blessing and every

support  to them. I hope that they will come  back

with the aspirations of the people fulifiled,  and

that  they will not return with what the  previous

Chief Minister had returned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>



with. May God bless them and good luck to them.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I wish to be the first to extend  my

sincere  congratulations to the All-Party  Merdeka

Conference which has reached agreement despite the

dramatic  demands  of  the United  Malays  National

Organisation, the undemocratic attempt to  exclude

Independent  Members  of  this  Assembly  and  the

refusal  to invite representatives from  political

Parties outside this Assembly. In this connection,

I  fully endorse the statements just made  by  the

Member  for  Queenstown  and  the  memorandum   represented  from  the  Party  Ra'ayat.  The  Merdeka

Conference  has  shown  great  responsibility  and

unity, and it has earned my happy congratulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper laid before us will undoubtedly

change  the lives of all the people in this  land;

indeed  it may even change the lives of the people

in  this  whole  region because of  the  important

strategic position of Singapore. Not only are  the

eyes  of  the people of Singapore focused  on  the

White  Paper  and  on  the deliberations  of  this

Assembly, but also, I am sure, the sympathetic and

encouraging   eyes  of  our  Asian   and   African

brothers. And I may be wrong, but wary and worried

eyes may be cast in this direction from London and

Washington.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important issue faces the people of

Singapore.  In  assessing the  chances  of  success  of

the  forthcoming  London talks, I  share  the  optimism

of  many  Members  of this House. At  about  this  time

last  year,  there  was the uprising  in  Cyprus  which

was   successfully  put  down  by  Field  Marshal   Sir

John  Harding;  and  there  was  also  the  victory  of

the   leftwing  Party  in  the  elections  in   Ceylon.

Events    were    such   that   the   politicians    at

Westminster   and  the  old  hands  at   the   Colonial

Office  in  London  felt that the time  was  right  for

them   to   resist  the  demands  of  the   people   of

Singapore.   Today, the  political   climate   is   a

little  different.  The  British  Prime  Minister,  Sir

Anthony Eden, who sought to oust

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>



President  Nasser of Egypt, has  himself  had  to

retire from the political scene. I think the time

for the London talks is favourable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learned a bitter lesson from the last talks.

Many  Members of this Assembly have just admitted

that there was disunity and party rivalry at  the

last  talks. Things are different now. This time,

we are united, from the conservative Right to the

extreme  Left,  and we are very  happy  that  all

Parties   have   shown  their  good   sense   and

responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heads of Agreement for the forthcoming

London talks are not very different from those of

last  April, but there are a few points  I  would

like to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External defence is to be left in the hands of

the   United  Kingdom  Government,  but   because

external  defence  is so closely  connected  with

internal  security,  I would  like  to  urge  the

United  Kingdom  Government  to  appreciate   the

national  aspirations  of  the  people  of   this

country  and  try not at any time to abuse  their

powers  on  external  defence  and  interfere  in

matters   connected  with  Singapore's   internal

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External affairs are also to be left in the

hands  of the United Kingdom Government. We would

like  Whitehall  to note that  although  we  have

agreed  to this, it does not mean that the people

of Singapore feel very happy about the matter and

are  willing to allow such vital power to be  out

of  their  hands for long. The right  to  control

external relations should not mean that  we  must

follow  everything Whitehall directs,  especially

on   relations  with  other  Asian  and   African

nations, which are our brothers. In this field, I

hope  the United Kingdom Government will give  us

the widest possible freedom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On external defence again, it should not mean

that  we must join in any military pact which  is

in the interests of the United Kingdom but not in

the  interests  of  the people of  Singapore.  An

example    is   the   South-East   Asia    Treaty

Organisation. Even Tunku Abdul Rahman has refused

to  become a member of that pact, and I hope  the

Mission will make it clear that though external



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>



defence  will be left in the hands of the  United

Kingdom  Government, they will  refuse  to  enter

into any military pact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item No. 3 of the White Paper, Sir, concerns the

designation  of  Her Majesty's Representative  in

Singapore.  The  United Kingdom  Government  must

feel  satisfied with the fact that the reasonable

and sensible people of Singapore have voluntarily

agreed  that the three most vital powers, namely,

the  suspension  of  the  Constitution,  external

defence  and foreign relations, should remain  in

the  hands  of the United Kingdom Government.  In

view  of  this, they should at least satisfy  our

present  limited national aspirations. A  MaIayan

must  be  our  first  Governor-General,  and  the

Representative of Her Majesty the  Queen  clearly

distinguished  from  the  Representative  of  the

United Kingdom Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the coming into force of the new

Constitution, I am very happy to note  that  many

Members feel that the new Constitution should  be

related  to  the finalisation of the  citizenship

laws.   Many   Members   have   mentioned    that

approximately 200,000 people will be entitled  to

vote  if those laws are passed. For a long  time,

those 200,000 people have been regarded as second-class  citizens, paying taxes but never  enjoying

the right to vote. It is therefore high time that

this  Assembly,  if  it  wants  a  fully  elected

Legislature representative of the whole people of

Singapore, should finalise the citizenship  laws

before  introducing the new Constitution. We  may

be  proud of the fact that we have been  able  to

replace  the Rendel Constitution in  so  short  a

time;  we  will be more proud if we can  finalise

the    new   citizenship   laws   and   introduce

multilingualism  in  this Assembly  at  an  early

date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of merger with the

Federation of Malaya. In this, I cannot share the

pessimism  of the Member for Tanjong Pagar.  Sir,

we   know   that  the  Chief  Minister   of   the

Federation, Tunku Abdul Rahman, is one of the few

truly  nationalist leaders in Malaya.  I  believe

that  what  he  does  and says  is  in  the  best

interests   of  the  people  not  only   of   the

Federation but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>



also of Singapore. If the people of Singapore and

the  Federation want a merger. I am sure that  no

matter   what  firm  policy  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman

adopts, he will have to follow the wishes of  the

people.  Please inform Whitehall that we are  not

only  hoping and fighting for a merger  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya but we are also  ambitious

and have the fervent hope that one day, sooner or

later,  we  will  take in British  North  Borneo,

Brunei  and Sarawak. We believe that if  the  Rt.

Hon. Sir Robert Scott can rule over the South-East

Asia  region, then why should not our Tunku Abdul

Rahman  one day become the first Governor-General

of  the  great Malaysia Republic? This artificial

separation   in   this  region  is   absurd   and

undemocratic.  It  is  harmful  to   our   lives,

politically,  economically and  even  culturally.

Looking  around  us now, you will  see  that  the

people  of Singapore are even prepared to  accept

Malay  as  the lingua franca - of course,  together

with  the three other official languages - in order

to   play   their  part  in  a  Greater   Malaya.

Personally, I am of the opinion - and I confirm the

general view of the Chinese here - that Malay  must

be  the lingua franca of this great Federation in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Can you speak Malay?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Saya boleh!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, allow me to speak as an ex-Merdeka delegate. I learned a most bitter lesson

and  I  humbly hope the delegates will  take  the

following points into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the delegates must be aware that they are

not  going as representatives of their respective

Parties  but as representatives of the people  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the delegates must not express their

individual  views or their Party's views  at  any

function and they must always remember that  what

they say will be taken as the views of the people

of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the delegates should try very hard to

avoid attending individually any private dinners,

luncheons and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>



cocktail  parties, especially those sponsored  by

the  colonial officials. We do not want to create

any  unnecessary misunderstanding. If they attend

any cocktail parties, luncheon parties, they must

go in a team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the Mission all success. Time and tide

are  with us! But if the Mission fails,  I  think

the  Government  must  do  something.  It  should

resign, and other Members of this House will  follow its lead. We are not going to work the Rendel

Constitution. We want to see the end  of  Colonel

Blimp. We will boycott any election under the Rendel  Constitution. Government must give  a  lead.

There  must be no more change of Chief Ministers.

And if the Chief Minister will do me a favour,  I

would like to forward through him to the Rt. Hon.

Mr  Lennox-Boyd  a book entitled,  "How  to  win

friends  and  influence people." Will  the  Chief

Minister tell him that now is the time for him to

win friends and not create unnecessary enemies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, I would like to sum up the

points I made. I say, in a nutshell, let there be

no more communal or party politics in London; let

no  Member  of  the Mission seek personal  glory;

remember  that unity is strength; stick  to  your

guns  and  success  is certain.  Sir,  I  beg  to

support the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G.E.N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Yes, Sir, in reply.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  after the  exhilarating  and

astounding speech of the previous speaker, I find

that I am having great difficulty in replying  to

most of the points raised by Members on the other

side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to hear that they are all united in

granting  citizenship rights to all those  people

affected  so  that  they can enjoy  and  exercise

their  votes  in  the choice of a new  government

under the new constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure hon. Members that it is

not Government's intention to delay the elections

deliberately, and if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>



we are able to secure from the Colonial Office and

introduce  citizenship rights before the  creation

of  the State of Singapore, the Government will do

everything possible to expedite the elections, but

it  must not be overlooked that the machinery  has

to  take  time  in order that elections  could  be

held.  I refer to the necessary amendment  to  the

British Nationality Act. This amendment has to  be

passed by the British Parliament. It is only after

it has been passed that this Assembly will be in a

position  to introduce new citizenship  laws,  and

only  after that can the people affected be  given

the   opportunity  to  register  as  citizens   of

Singapore.  And I did say, too, that a  reasonable

length  of time must also be given to them  if  we

really mean them to enjoy those rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that will come the preparation of the

electoral rolls. But before these can be prepared,

the   delimitation  of  boundaries   has   to   be

considered. In this, I think we would like to have

an  all-party  committee on the  job  as  soon  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar and the Member for

Changi  drew  attention to the fact  that  if  the

Mission  to  London  is  unsuccessful,  I   should

resign.  I do not like that word, Sir, but  I  did

say  this - and I mean it - that if the Mission fails,

the  purpose  of  my  accepting  office  as  Chief

Minister will have come to an end and I will  not,

and  do  not, propose to continue. But that should

not be taken as a threat to resign. I took on this

job  for  a  purpose, and whether the  purpose  is

achieved or not, it will come to an end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the national importance of this

motion, it is my intention to call for a division,

in which the ex-officio Members will abstain.
