<div align="center"><b>COMMON GAMING HOUSES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[12th  May,  1960], "That the Bill be now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday the Minister for Labour and Law referred

to  the fact that in the United Kingdom Parliament

was  passing  a  Bill  legalising  public  betting

shops.  He  did not say, however, that in  England

public  lotteries  are  illegal.  Now,  this  Bill

before the House makes public lotteries legal.  So

at  one fell swoop the Singapore Government  tries

to  get  as much money as possible from those  who

are already patronising the illegal bookmakers and

those  who can be attracted to patronise  the  new

betting shops and buy public lottery tickets  that

will  be  issued  by  approved  racing  clubs   or

associations.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> You kill two birds with one stone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, if they are really in

earnest about helping the masses, they should make

one  experiment first to see whether  the  effects

are  good  or bad. If the results are  good, then

perhaps   they   could  embark   on   the   second

experiment.  Instead, at one fell swoop  they  are

introducing public gambling on a big scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure those of us who were here during the

Japanese  military occupation will  remember  that

they  had public lotteries regularly; so regularly

that after a period of enthusiasm people began to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



be  wiser  and the tickets had to be sold  by  the

Chamber  of  Commerce and the One-Star,  Two-Star,

and  Three-Star  men. They had legalised  gambling

dens  in  amusement  parks. And  we  remember  the

people  found hanging behind some of  these  parks

and  in  lanes,  because they had  lost  money  in

gambling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the face of that kind of evidence, we

are  now  going  back to make  the  same  kind  of

experiment on a big scale!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I was accused of being out of touch

with  reality because I live in the atmosphere  of

Moral Rearmament. Sir, that is far from the truth.

Instead of being out of touch with reality, I must

say  that  I  am far more so now. I  realise  that

everybody, deep down, is selfish unless he  has  a

change  of heart. Whether a man is a Communist,  a

capitalist or a socialist, or by whatever label he

calls himself, deep down he is selfish. And if  we

say  that a capitalist is selfish because he wants

money,  the Communist is selfish because he  wants

power.  So basically we are selfish unless  we  go

through a period of change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this seems on the surface to be a Bill

to  stop  illegal  gambling, but  I  am  not  sure

whether the Government Benchers are saints.  Being

realistic - I know not all, but perhaps  a  few  are

approaching sainthood, and even then they would be

realists - we admit that deep down the motive  might

also be selfish. Therefore, I presume that the $10

million  is  the  bait  that  is  attracting   the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

should be careful about treading on grounds  which

have  already been covered in the debates  on  the

previous  two  Bills. We are now on a  Bill  which

seeks    to   legalise   public   lotteries    and

sweepstakes.  I know the dividing line  is  a  bit

difficult  to find, but I ask the hon. Member  not

to retread the ground we have covered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, yesterday I was just

about to refer to a well-known philanthropist  who

cannot be accused of having been out of touch with

reality. A man who has made his way up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



from poverty to the top rung in business cannot be

regarded  as being out of touch with reality.  But

this man, Sir, had a different kind of reality. He

was  against public lotteries because he knew that

the   masses  would  fall  for  public  lotteries,

thinking  they  were  going to  make  easy  money.

Thereby  they  would be deprived  of  their  hard-earned  earnings. He was realistic  not  with  the

object   of  exploiting  the  situation  and   the

weaknesses  of the masses, but with  the  idea  of

preventing them from going down deeper. His  life,

Sir,  was distinguished by his efforts to  improve

the living conditions of the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to someone whose views should be

more   acceptable  to  those  on  the   Government

benches,  who  have  declared  that  they  are  so

socialistic  that  there is no  one  who  is  more

socialistic    than   themselves,    except    the

Communists.  Sir, I am referring to  Mr  Tan  Kah

Kee.  In  1947, the same issue was in  mind - public

lotteries  in  order to clear the slums.  "We  can

clear  the  slums  with  State  lotteries."  I  am

quoting, Sir, from a paper that is no longer being

published, the Sunday Tribune of 15th June,  1947.

It  was a burning issue then. I would like to read

out  Mr  Tan's views as published in this  paper.

Said Mr

Tan:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lottery, as we know, is one of the worst forms

of  gambling. In this case, its evils would assume

such  magnitude once it is started  as  to  spread

harmful  effects  not  only  in  Malaya  and   the

neighbouring  countries but  also  in  places  far

away."



<br><br>Mr Tan went further:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ease with which money can be raised by

running  a lottery is due to the weakness  of  the

people  who  resort to this kind of get-rich-quick

speculation."



<br><br>Sir, he was realistic. I am realistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wherever there is a lottery, the poor will use

part of their money to try their luck."



<br><br>Finally:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prize winners will benefit little from their

luck. Money easily earned is easily spent."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps the Government side does not agree

with  a  practical and realistic man like Mr  Tan

Kah  Kee  about public lotteries. However,  may  I

appeal to them on this basis: that if after  their

experiments have been tried out for six



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



months,  and in all honesty they find the  effects

are  not  good,  will  they  then  reconsider  the

question and give up those measures which not only

produce additional revenue, but also produce other

evils along with that additional revenue?



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Member for  Tanglin  has  been

speaking at great length and with great feeling on

the  subject  of  State lotteries  and  off-course

betting.  Indeed he spoke with such great  fervour

that  I cannot help coming to the conclusion  that

he   has   been   tormented  by   some   kind   of

psychological fixation. Throughout  his  many  and

varied  speeches, I have been trying to trace  the

roots of this fixation. So far as I can make  out,

he is troubled about two principal outcomes, which

Government's measures would lead to. They are,  in

the  first place, that Government intends to  open

hundreds  and thousands of betting shops.  When  I

interjected  with  the  word  "millions",  he  too

agreed  that  we  might open millions  of  betting

shops.  That  is  the first thing  that  has  been

troubling him. Now, may I assure him, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that the Government does not intend to  open

even one betting shop?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to his second fixation, and that is

his  fear that it would be our policy to encourage

schoolboys  and the schoolgirls to bet on  horses.

When  I  was a schoolboy, Mr Speaker, Sir,  which

was of course more recent than when the Member for

Tanglin  was  a  schoolboy,  I  did  not  get  the

impression that there was any desire at all  among

my fellow schoolmates to bet on horses. I attended

the  school of which the Member for Tanglin is now

the  principal, and I can only hope that since  my

graduation from the school standards of  behaviour

have not declined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin went to great lengths to

discourse on the evils of betting.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have passed the

subject  of  betting. We are on public  lotteries,

unless that is the same thing. Mr Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. He did say a great deal  about  the

evils   of  gambling  and  generally  the   tragic

consequences that this could lead to. I would have

thought that, if he were genuine in his belief, he

would  have pressed for the abolition of all types

of gambling, including the present system of sales

of  lottery  tickets to members. But this  is  not

what  the  Member for Tanglin wanted. He obviously

has  no  objection  if lottery  tickets,  possibly

horse-racing, is strictly reserved for the delight

of  a  few  persons. But the point  is  that  this

activity  is  now practised on such  an  extensive

scale  that we cannot afford to ignore the illegal

activities,  which  have  surrounded  gambling  in

general. It is because of this that Government  is

introducing this type of legislation.  The  Member

for  Tanglin  praised the previous Government  for

resisting the temptation to legalise certain forms

of  gambling and to allow for its extension  under

controlled conditions. Now he is obviously  either

unaware of or unimpressed by the great harm, which

has  been  done by illegal bookmakers and  private

lottery syndicates, which are going on on  a  very

large  scale.  These are major problems  which  we

have  to  tackle,  because they  are  one  of  the

sources  of  income for secret society  gangsters,

and  the whole underground apparatus of a gambling

organisation  strikes at the root of  society  and

demoralises a large number of people.  The  Member

for  Tanglin  is  only interested in  the  outward

manifestations  of gambling. So  long  as  on  the

surface  things appear decent, he does  not  worry

about  the  evil  that goes  on  behind  the  open

facade.  Although the previous Government did  not

take  the  measure, which we are now  taking,  the

fact  remains  that  gambling  in  all  it  forms,

particularly in its illegal forms, has been on the

increase  all these years. And this is principally

due  to  the policy, which the Member for  Tanglin

entirely   approves,  that  is,  to  confine   the

accepted  forms of gambling, such as  lottery  and

horse, racing, to a limited circle and allow  the

whole cancer of illegal betting to spread all over

Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, I find this  attitude

most  deplorable, and I think I could best express

my feelings on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



the  subject if I were to quote from a book  which

is familiar to the Member for Tanglin. I will read

from  the  New Testament, the Gospel according  to

Saint Matthew, Chapter 23, Verse 24:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,

for  ye make clean the outward side of the cup and

of   the  platter,  but  within  ye  are  full  of

extortion and excess. Ye blind Pharisees,  cleanse

first that which is within the cup and the platter

that  outside of them may be clean also. Woe  unto

you  scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are

like  unto lighted sepulchres which appear  indeed

beautiful  outward but within  are  full  of  dead

man's   bones  and  all  uncleanliness   Ye   also

outwardly appear righteous as a man but within  ye

are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it, of course, that

that quotation has no direct reference to a Member

of  this Assembly. Because if it has, it is out of

order. Will the Member assure me that there is  no

direct reference to any particular Member?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There is no direct reference

at all, Mr Speaker. It is just the reaction which

I feel to the views which have been expressed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  we  were debating on the Betting  Bill,

and as you have quite rightly ruled, the debate on

this  particular  Bill  shall  not  bring  in  any

reference  to  betting shops. Sir,  yesterday,  at

least,  the Government had some reasonable  excuse

to  introduce  such a Bill. It said that  it  must

wipe  out  the  scourge of bookmakers.  Hence  the

introduction  of  the  Betting  Bill - to  wipe  out

bookmakers.   But  if,  in  the  wiping   out   of

bookmakers,  it is later considered  expedient  or

necessary that one should expand the activities of

legal  betting, then it could not be  helped,  one

must face reality. But now let us face the reality

of this Bill. This is to give legal blessing to  a

public lottery. It is not betting at all. It  says

that  any person can now go and buy a ticket in  a

sweepstake, in a public lottery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, one of the reasons advanced for

the  Betting  Bill was that there  was  no  reason

whatsoever why so much money should flow into  the

pockets of bookmakers. Why should not this money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



be  deflected into the coffers of Government?  But

in  this  case, Sir, money has not gone  down  the

drain  nor into the pockets of anybody. If I  were

to  buy  a  ticket  in a sweepstake  or  a  public

lottery of a turf club of which I am not a member,

yet  the Government is assured of its 30 per  cent

tax.  There would be no loss of revenue,  even  if

the tickets were to be sold secretly and illegally

to  non-members. Therefore, this attempt to try to

say that we should now legalise public lottery  is

just  the thin end of the wedge. If Government  is

really   so  anxious  that  the  money  spent   on

sweepstake  tickets by the public is  money  spent

foolishly by the public, and if the Government  is

anxious  to  make  use of or to  cash  in  on  the

weaknesses  of human nature, then it should  begin

to  think.  But  perhaps it would be  a  wonderful

thing if the Government could have a state lottery

of  its own. Then it could have the whole 100  per

cent instead of a meagre 30 per cent. This kind of

state  lottery is evil. It demoralises people.  It

is  bad for the conscience of any good government.

And  1  say this, Sir: that in spite of  what  has

been said by the front benchers of the Government,

it   is  significant  that  their  back  benchers,

although  it  was  their  wont  to  stand  up  and

champion  any policy of the Government, have  been

silent. Perhaps, Sir, it is not so bad that  there

is  still a conscience in the Party members of the

P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> I am a back

bencher,  Sir, and I have risen up to  answer  the

front bencher of the opposite bench.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They do not have back benchers!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As usual the Opposition

always  like  to, as the Member for Cairnhill  has

just said, cash in on whatever they think they can

cash  in  on.  This  is one of the  opportunities,

which they have. But I would not like to quote the

Scriptures, Sir. We all understand what ultimately

it  really means. They try to paint a picture that

they  are real saints and that they are trying  to

protect  the public. They try and claim that  they

can really do something good. Whenever a good Bill

comes  from  the Government bench, they  say,  "We

agree with it." Yet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



they try to pick holes here and there. And when it

comes  to  an acclaim from the public,  they  say,

"Oh,  we also agree with it." When it comes to  an

issue  on  which  public opinion may  possibly  be

divided, they, of course, straightaway pick on the

other side and say, "We are on the morally correct

side."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is really meant to control and

not to allow an extension of public lotteries. The

Member  for Cairn-hill said that the idea  of  the

other two Bills which, were passed was to wipe out

the  bookmakers,  but  that  this  was  to  expand

betting.  Surely he knows the extent of chap-ji-ki

that  is rampant in Singapore. He will also  know,

Sir,  that a lot of people who are not members  of

the  Turf  Clubs  have  been buying  tickets  from

members of the Turf Clubs. Cases have appeared  in

the  papers where non-members have to go to  court

in  order  to sue for what they claim to be  their

own   winnings.   This  is  a  common   occurrence

everywhere. If anybody should care to  go  to  any

coffee-shop,  or  anywhere, they  can  always  buy

those tickets. Everybody knows that Social Welfare

tickets  from the Federation are sold very  easily

in  Singapore.  Previously, when  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  was in power, they never seemed  to  do

anything  about it. And now just because it  comes

from  the  P.A.P. Government and just  because  we

hope to control something which we know cannot  be

eradicated,  they  say it is  bad.  They  talk  of

realism. Well, this is realism right through. They

do  not  know what it really means. We the  P.A.P.

are   realistic   in  contradistinction   to   the

idealistic  point which they are  advocating.  The

Member  for  Tanglin also quoted  philanthropists,

and     also     talked     about     selfishness.

Psychologically,  everybody  born  is  in  a   way

selfish.   But  the  difference  between   certain

systems  of  government is that in  socialism,  if

there  is any selfishness in a person, we try  and

inculcate into that person how to learn and  think

of  others.  In other words, we try and  think  of

things  from a socialistic point of view. Just  as

man  is  now  able to inhibit the other  instincts

that  are inherent in him, so if there is  such  a

thing as selfishness, we must also try and control

it.  That is the only way of advancement  in  this

world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also mentioned the fact

that  this Bill was merely introduced in order  to

obtain  revenue. Surely, he knows that  Government

have  many  other  ways  of  getting  revenue.  In

addition, when he talked of the Government getting

30  per cent revenue from the lotteries, in actual

fact.  Government can gain much more revenue  from

the  sale  of liquor. What about revenue from  the

bar  houses? What about revenue from samsu, liquor

and even opium, if you like, which is not allowed?

Why is he not raising any objection to the sale of

liquor?  The  amount  of revenue  that  Government

gains  from the sale of liquor is very, very great

indeed.  Surely  the Member for Tanglin  does  not

want  us to go back to the time, if I may  say  so

again, Sir, when his father was telling him  about

Johore Bahru and that people had to go across  the

Causeway  in order to indulge in a little  bit  of

gambling.  Gambling is in the blood of  everybody.

If  we  cannot get rid of it, let us at least  try

and  control it. If in controlling it we  get  the

condemnation of the opposite side, then we say, to

put  it  kindly, that they have a special  bee  in

their  bonnet,  or  that they are  merely  burying

their heads in the sand.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that we

that  the Members on the Front Bench opposite  are

the  people who appear not to know what  everybody

in   Singapore  does  know.  The  public  gambling

situation in Singapore has two aspects. There  are

the  organisers of bookmaking. There are also  the

organisers of public lotteries. The organisers  of

public lotteries are those who promote games  like

chap-ji-ki, tikam ekor, three digits, four digits,

or   what   have  you.  They  are  everywhere   in

Singapore. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



are  operating  within 50 yards of  this  Assembly

House.  Everybody knows that. We have got to  deal

with that situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin is a moralist and thinks

that  gambling  is quite wrong. We  as  socialists

also  say  that gambling in Singapore is a  social

evil.  But look at the situation that we  find  in

Singapore.  From  1929, there has  been  legalised

gambling  in  Singapore. The exemption  under  the

Betting  Ordinance has been an exemption  that  we

have not introduced. It has `been part of our very

lives from 1929. Look at the position of the  Turf

Club  itself.  The Club is licensed  to  carry  on

gaming, which is restricted to its members. It has

three  types  of  membership. There  are  ordinary

members, there are subscribing members, and  there

are  associate members. It could be said that  the

ordinary members are people who really go there to

enjoy  the sport of racing. They gamble, but  they

also  take an interest in horse-racing as a sport.

The  subscribing members go there to bet. They pay

a  fee of $15 a year. The Government gets a tax of

about $5.20 as, entertainment duty. There are  the

associate  members. These people are not permitted

on  the  course. They go there just to participate

in  the sweepstakes. They are there only for  that

purpose.  It is common knowledge that anybody  can

go  to  the  Turf Club - he need not be a member - and

participate to his heart's delight in gambling  if

he  wants  to  do  so  and  if  he  has  got  that

inclination.  It is as simple as  all  that.  They

pass  their badges, to one another to go in.  That

is the situation which my friend and colleague has

just   referred   to.  That  is  the   veneer   of

respectability. So long as there is that veneer of

respectability,  the Member for  Tanglin  is  most

satisfied.  He can go to church and pray  all  the

harder  for  it.  Mr Speaker. Sir,  that  is  the

position which we find in Singapore. Coupled with

that,  there  are  organisers of public  lotteries

elsewhere  who send their lottery tickets  to  us.

You  can  go to any petrol kiosk at any  time  you

want.  You  buy petrol. You can also  buy  lottery

tickets emanating from else-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



where. That is the situation we find in Singapore.

We  are socialists. We regard gambling objectively

as a social evil. Something must be done about all

this.  We  cannot bury our heads in the sand  and

say,  "Well,  God is in heaven and  everything  is

right  in  the  world." We are not  that  sort  of

people.  That is why we have taken the trouble  to

introduce  the  Betting  Ordinance  to   make   it

difficult  for  these  operators  to  continue  to

operate.  We  have  looked very closely  into  the

Common  Gaming Houses Ordinance, and we find  that

the provisions there are sufficient for us to deal

with  the situation. We are now running all  these

operators to earth. Is it not better for us to try

and   control   the  situation?  These   are   the

facilities available in the Turf Club. What we  do

is to accept the facts as they are. We say, "Well,

if that is so, let us extend these facilities." We

go  for  all the clandestine organisers  of  these

types   of   public  lotteries  and   extend   the

facilities available at the Turf Club to  all  and

sundry. That is the realistic way of doing things.

Why  allow  these chaps to continue  to  get  huge

profits  from all this illegal bookmaking?  Surely

that  would  be  stupid on  our  part.  The  other

alternative  is  this. Close down the  Turf  Club.

They  go elsewhere, just across the causeway. They

operate  in the same way. What control do we  have

over  the situation then? We are not talking sense

if we do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when hon. Members say that

gambling  is  evil, demoralising and bad  for  the

conscience, we, the socialists, say that  that  is

so. We have never come here and said that there is

any justification for public gaming. We accept the

situation  as  it is and are trying  to  bring  it

under  effective  control and to check  all  these

demoralising influences on our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to refer to

what the Member for Tanglin has suggested. He says

that  once this Bill is passed into law, there  is

nothing  to  prevent  lotteries,  emanating   from

elsewhere,  being sold publicly in  Singapore.  He

has  not  properly looked at the clauses  of  this

Bill. It is quite clear that only tickets sold  by

an exempted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



club will not be regarded as tickets that are

part of a public lottery. This is clearly stated

in one of the clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is the position. We are

realists  and  we have therefore to introduce  the

Bill to try and bring the situation under control.

It  has  been  said  just now by  the  Member  for

Tanglin  that I mentioned to this House  yesterday

that  the  House of Commons has passed legislation

to  permit  betting  houses to be  established  in

England. But in England they have not gone as  far

as  we are proposing to do. Public lotteries  are

still  illegal  in England. But, Sir,  we  have  a

different situation here. I do not know  what  the

situation in England is. They there are facing  up

to  their own internal problems. We face up to our

own  problems. It is quite clear that it would  be

futile,  senseless and stupid on our  part  if  we

only  went  against the bookmakers  and  left  the

people  who  promote chap-ji-ki,  tikam  ekor  and

other  forms of public gaming alone. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, we have listened to all that has been said on

this matter. Some have got emotional about it.  We

are   rational  people.  So  far,  we  are   quite

convinced in our minds that this is the best  that

we can do in the present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Byrne].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, in clause 2 the new

section 23, line 4, there is the word "any":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ... it shall not be an offence for any person to

buy a ticket or chance or take part in any public

lottery held, promoted, ...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was put forward that children in school

would  not have the chance to buy lottery tickets.

If  these lottery tickets are on sale and if it is

not an offence for any person to buy a ticket, how

are the young children to be prevented from buying

them? I would like the Minister for Labour and Law

to  answer  that question and tackle  the  problem

seriously. Sir, I have been accused of not  facing

up  to realities. As a schoolmaster with 40 years'

experience, I know the habits of boys' very  well.

During  this  period  of  40  years,  things  have

changed considerably. We have got secret societies

organised in schools all over Singapore. That is a

reality,  which we face today. We know  that  some

boys in some schools are also conducting gambling

on  their own. If today they do anything like that

or  they buy lottery tickets which are illegal and

they  are  reported, action is taken against  them

and the practice stops. But once this Bill becomes

law  and a schoolboy buys 20 tickets and he  sells

them to his friends to share the fortune that  is

supposed  to come, and if a teacher says  to  him,

"Sorry,  you  are  not allowed to  do  that."  the

answer is given to the teacher's face, "Sir, it is

the law of the land." What is the teacher going to

say?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Minister for Finance

quoted  the Scriptures. I hope he will quote  them

often.  But I think he forgot to stress  the  fact

that when one studies the Scriptures, one has  got

to learn to apply them to oneself first. We should

look for the mote in our own eyes before we try to

remove  the beam from the eyes of other people.  I

am  glad  that the Minister read a quotation  from

the  Scriptures and I hope that it will  apply  to

everyone of us.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I find that

I  have  to  rise again to speak on  this  clause.

During   the  Second  Reading  of  this  Bill,   a

Government Front-Bencher and a Back-Bencher  tried

to explain that it was necessary to have this Bill

because  Government wanted to control chap-ji-ki,

tikam ekor, and so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



on.  Sir, this is the only clause that is left  in

this  Bill. There is nothing in this Bill  to  say

that chap-ji-ki, tikam ekor, and so on, are to  be

controlled. The control is already there. So it is

not right to say that this clause is introduced in

order  to control chap-ji-ki and tikarn ekor.  But

it  is right to say that this clause is introduced

to  expand  facilities for taking part  in  public

lotteries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is not a case of

expansion but a case of rechanneling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Tanglin  has asked me to state whether it  is  the

intention   of  the  Government  to  prohibit   or

restrict  the  sale of public lottery  tickets  to

school children and to young people generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is possible for control to

be  exercised in the case of betting  houses.  One

can  make  a  rule that people of  a  certain  age

should   not   be  admitted  into   such   places.

Administratively, it can be done. But in the  case

of  the sale of public lottery tickets, it is  not

possible to exercise a similar kind of control and

even  if  we  try  to  do so, it  would  never  be

effective. If a rule is made that lottery  tickets

are not to be sold to youngsters, there is nothing

to  prevent  older  people from  buying  them  and

passing them on to youngsters. Even if it is ruled

that a youngster will not be entitled to the prize

money on the lottery ticket he buys, what he  will

do  is to pass the ticket on to a grown-up person.

So  it  is  not possible to supervise  such  sales

administratively in that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point made by the Member for Tanglin

was  that  we appear to be wanting only to  expand

the  facilities  for gaming. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

have taken the trouble just now to mention to  him

that these facilities are already available in the

Turf   Club.   Three  types  of   membership   are

recognised there. An associate member is a  person

who  can  go there but he does not participate  in

betting.  He  goes  there to  participate  in  the

sweeps.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all that is one big sham. Let us

recognise the position and say frankly, "Let there

be  public lotteries." I have looked through  this

Bill  very carefully, Mr Speaker, Sir. Under  the

Common   Gaming   Houses  Ordinance,   there   are

sufficient  powers to deal with the  promoters  of

these  public lotteries, like tikam ekor, chap-ji-

ki,  and  so  on. We have all the powers  that  we

want. No additional powers are necessary. All that

we  have  to  do is to go for them and bring  them

down.  That is what we are proposing to do.  There

is  practically public gaming in the  premises  of

the  Turf Club and their tickets are sold  to  the

public.  There is a great difference, to my  mind,

between purchasing a lottery ticket and placing  a

bet  in a betting shop. Although we, as Socialists

condemn  gambling - like betting and organising  the

sale  of sweepstake lottery tickets - where  is  the

evil  really  in  buying a lottery  ticket  for  a

dollar or fifty cents? It is not as evil as  going

into a betting shop and placing your bets. One has

got  to  acknowledge that people are human beings.

All those people -  even the person who places a bet

or  buys  a lottery ticket - are not evildoers  just

because they do that. It is the people who promote

all  these  things that we are going for.  In  our

campaign, we will have to run these people in  and

we  will  have  to extend the betting  facilities.

Incidentally,   we  will  get   more   money.   We

acknowledge that. But we do not do all  this  with

the primary object of getting more revenue. Public

gaming  has  reach ed such proportions  here  that

something has got to be done about it and  we  are

taking  this course. We hope that we will  achieve

the  objects  that we have in view. We  are  quite

determined to bring these activities under  proper

control  and  that  is why we  are  seeking  these

powers from this House.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, I quite

agree  with  the  Minister that the  buying  of  a

lottery  ticket is not evil. I am not thinking  of

it  as  an evil. But what I fail to understand  is

this:  how does Government hope, by this Bill,  to

suppress or catch or arrest or stop these  illegal

operators? Do Government think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



that, by having legal operators of their own, they

are  going  to draw the public from these  illegal

bookmakers to their own legal operators?  In  that

case,  as I asked yesterday, what competition  can

they offer? What I maintain is that they will  not

be  able to draw the crowd from the bookmakers and

illegal  operators to the legal operators.  Unless

the  Government  see a way of  achieving  that,  I

myself  cannot see how this Bill is going to  help

them do it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was indeed

very  disturbed  to learn from  the  Minister  for

Labour  and Law when he confessed that,  with  the

operation of this law, the Government would not be

able  to  control the sale of lottery  tickets  to

school children. He said that school children  can

now  buy lottery tickets. As has been pointed  out

by  the  Minister, it is only the members of  turf

clubs  who can buy lottery tickets at the  present

time.  No  non-member  of a  turf  club  would  be

qualified  to buy a lottery ticket from  a  member

unless  he or she has confidence' in the integrity

of  the  member.  Therefore,  the  sale  of  those

tickets  to  a  non-member is  restricted  to  the

extent of the integrity of the member who hopes to

get a ten per cent cut of the prize money. But now

to  say  that anyone - even school children - can  buy

lottery tickets within the meaning of the  law  is

surely  an  expansion of, shall we say, facilities

for gambling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, when I put forward the

problem to the Minister, I had hoped that he would

have  been  able  to  find some  solution  whereby

students and young children would not be  able  to

buy  lottery tickets and re-sell them. I am  sorry

he  has  admitted that it cannot be done and  that

there  is no solution. Sir, we know that the young

people  comprise more than half the population  of

Singapore today. Fifty cent and dollar tickets are

within  their reach. Therefore, when this Bill  is

passed,  it  will  enable school children  to  buy

lottery  tickets  freely and flaunt  them  in  the

faces   of  their  teachers,  saying,  "There   is

nothing, Sir, that you can do to prevent my buying

these tickets, because I am not going against  the

law of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



the  land."  And that is going to  make  it  very

difficult for educationalists to tell them, "Boys,

you  must work hard. You cannot depend on luck for

success  in  life. You have got to do  it  on  the

basis  of  industry," because they can very  well

say,  "That is all nonsense. If I buy  a  lottery

ticket  for fifty cents and I can get $100,000,  I

do not have to study any more."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  no amount of legislation can prevent  school

children from buying lottery tickets, just as  you

cannot  prevent  them  now from  smoking  or  even

visiting brothel houses.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in reply to the last

speaker, Although there had been no legislation so

far   until  this  Bill  was  introduced,   school

children had not been buying lottery tickets.  But

this  Bill  is going to encourage them to  do  so,

because the Minister has now openly said that  the

Government will not be able to control  them  from

buying  lottery  tickets. In  view  of  that,  the

Opposition,  Sir, will have to vote  against  this

clause.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a certain amount of

repetition.  Perhaps the Minister  would  like  to

wind up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I never said

anything of that sort. I did not say that we could

not   control.  I  said  we  could   not   control

effectively. Even if we were to issue instructions

that  no  such  sales should  be  made  to  school

children  and young people, there are no means  of

carrying  out those instructions. Suppose  it  was

decreed  that any youngster who, obtained a  prize

on  a  ticket  would not get the benefit  of  that

prize, such a rule cannot be administered. I  said

before  that he wou1d just pass the ticket  on  to

somebody  else, possibly an adult, and the  latter

could  collect  the money. How  is  the  situation

different  from that which we know  today?  Today,

youngsters  can buy Federation lottery tickets  in

Singapore  quite  openly. The  Opposition  is  not

fussy  about that. It is done openly. There is  no

fuss  about it. Then why all this fuss and bother?

We are doing everything



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



to bring the situation under effective control. If

you  want  to deal effectively with gambling,  you

must  recognise that human beings are human beings

and  that  there must be an outlet for  them.  You

cannot  go for the promoters only and not  provide

an  outlet. There must be an outlet. As practical

people,  we  say  that this is  the  only  way  of

dealing with the situation as we know it today.

foolish   remark,  if  I  may  say  so,   from   a

Government  is  not encouraging  the  children  of

Singapore  to buy public lottery tickets.  I  have

stated repeatedly to the House that Government has

looked  into  the whole question and is  satisfied

that  the proposals we have made in this Bill  are

the  only  practical way of dealing  with  a  very

difficult  situation as regards public  gaming  in

say   that  the  Government  is  encouraging   the

are  tickets being sold openly in the  streets  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Convention for the Suppression

of Counterfeiting Currency was signed at Geneva on

Convention.  The purpose of the Convention  is  to

lay down rules to provide the most effective means

for  ensuring the prevention and punishment of the

offence of counterfeiting currency. Article 23  of

the   Convention  provides  that  the  Convention

cannot  be  ratified  by any  country  unless  its

that territory are in conformity with such rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the provisions of the

Convention  are  already  part  of  the   law   of

Singapore, but in order to give complete effect to

the  Convention certain amendments  to  the  Penal

Code  are required and these are contained in  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill proposes a definition of

"currency   note"  which  follows  the  definition

contained  in section 1 (2) of the United  Kingdom

Counterfeit Currency (Convention) Act, 1935.  This

gives effect as far as paper money is concerned to

Article   2  of  the  Convention,  which   defines

currency  as meaning "paper money (including  bank

notes)  and  metallic money,  the  circulation  of

which  is  legally recognised." As respects  metal

money,  the  definitions of  "coin"  and  "current

coin" in section 230 of the Penal Code are already

in accord with the requirements of the Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 4 of the Bill provide for the

seizure and forfeiture of counterfeit currency and

coin, as well as instruments or other articles for

counterfeiting in order to give effect to  Article

11 of the Convention. These provisions are based



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



on section 11(5) of the United Kingdom Coinage

Offences Act, 1936, and section 2 of the

Counterfeit Currency (Convention) Act, 1935.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Byrne].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Actually, of course, the

Certificate  of  Urgency applies to  the  Committee

Stage and the Third reading. But if the Certificate

could  be  handed  in  now,  I  could  explain  the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. I might

explain  to  hon.  Members that I have  formed  the

opinion  that  this  Bill is  a  hybrid  Bill,  and

consequently,  under  the  provisions  of  Standing

Order  65,  the Bill should ordinarily,  after  the

Second  Reading, be referred to a Select Committee.

The Certificate of Urgency, however, takes the Bill

out  of the ambit of Standing Order 65, and it will

consequently be proceeded with, if the Minister  so

wishes,  through the Committee stage and the  Third

Reading today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said just now,

when  I  became the Minister for Labour and Law  in

June,  1959,  I  found  to  my  surprise  that  the

Community  Recreation Division, which  used  to  be

part  of the Department of Social Welfare had  been

handed  over to an employee of the Asia  Foundation

by the former Government and was being administered

from  the  Singapore Youth Sports Centre. Added  to

this  strange  situation, the control of  community

centres   and  youth  clubs  owned  and  built   by

Government had by that time completely passed  into

the  hands  of community associations and  advisory

committees  under  the control of  persons  closely

connected  with  the  former  Government  who  were

defeated  candidates at the last General  Election.

So  complete was this control that the staff of the

Department of Social Welfare were only in name  the

servants  of the Ministry. The result, as could  be

expected,  was a complete standstill in the  normal

activities of nearly all our community centres. The

only  activity  of  note then was  the  holding  of

cinema  shows for which fees were charged,  and  it

was  generally  known that these  fees  were  being

pocketed by those in control.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I decided that this situation

should  not  be  allowed  to  continue  and   gave

instructions that the Department of Social Welfare

should  reassume control of all community  centres

and  youth  clubs  in Singapore. This  process  of

taking over was completed in December 1959. Having

succeeded  in bringing the community  centres  and

youth clubs under departmental control, it is  now

necessary   to   associate  the  people   in   the

management  of these community centres  and  youth

clubs and for this purpose it is proposed in  this

Bill  to  set  up a Corporation by legislation  to

promote  community recreation in  Singapore.  This

organisation  would  be able  to  provide  trained

leaders  who would be able to work on  the  ground

amongst   the  people,  popularise  the  community

centres   and  youth  clubs  and  organise   their

activities. No community centre or youth club  can

ever  succeed  without the active co-operation  of

the  people, and such centres are most  successful

if  they  are  run by leaders who  understand  the

needs and interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the Assembly is designed to set

up  a People's Association which will work closely

with  the  Community Recreation  Division  of  the

Department of Social Welfare and with associations

representing the people which will have members in

the Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of this Bill is designed to establish

the  People's  Association  as  a  Corporation  to

promote community recreation in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 enables the Corporation to take over

the  assets and the movable and immovable property

of  the  Singapore Youth Sports Centre, which  has

been wound up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill sets out the constitution

of  the Board of Management which will consist  of

14  members, with the Prime Minister as  Chairman,

the   Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  as   Deputy

Chairman,  the Minister for Finance, the  Director

of  Social  Welfare  as  Secretary-Treasurer,  six

members  to be appointed by the Chairman and  four

members to be elected from among the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



representatives of the organisations mentioned  in

the Schedule to the Bill. The Board will therefore

have  strong  Government representation  and  will

have  the benefit of the experience of its members

who  will  be  drawn from a very wide educational,

recreational and cultural field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill sets out the objects and

powers  of the Corporation. The objects  are  "The

organisation of leisure and the promotion of youth

activities  in  order  not  only  to  develop  the

cultural,  moral  and physical  potentialities  of

youth,  but  also  to  instil  in  the  youth   of

Singapore  a  sense  of national  identity  and  a

spirit  of dedicated service to the community  and

the    organisation   and   promotion   of   group

participation in social, cultural, educational and

athletic  activities in order that, the  youth  of

Singapore may be made to realise that they  belong

not   to   any  particular  racial  or   religious

community,  but  to  a  Malayan  community   which

transcends  communal  and racial  loyalties."  The

Corporation  has  power, inter  alia,  to  appoint

committees, officers and servants to carry out its

objects  and receive contributions from Government

and  other sources. It can also raise funds on its

own.  Most important of all is its power to manage

or run community centres, youth clubs, boys' clubs

and  girls'  clubs  and to organise  training  for

leaders  to  work  in such community  centres  and

clubs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will not involve Government in any

extra    financial   expenditure.   The   People's

Association when incorporated will be able to draw

upon  voluntary  service more  than  a  Government

department would be able to. There are at  present

45  community centres and more are being built  in

all  areas  in  Singapore where  there  are  large

concentrations   of   population   without    such

amenities. With this rapid expansion in the number

of   community   centres  and  the  necessity   of

providing  a  planned  programme  of  educational,

cultural  and  recreational  activities  for   the

larger numbers, which will be using these centres,

it  is  obvious  that  an  organisation  like  the

People's   Association   in   which   associations

representing the people are members will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



better   equipped  to  take  charge  of  community

recreation  on  such  a scale  than  a  Government

Department.   Furthermore,  Government   machinery

moves slowly and Government servants on their  own

cannot  provide the leadership required  for  this

purpose.  A  People's Association is  clearly  the

answer.  Government  is confident  that  with  the

establishment   of   the   People's   Association,

community  centres  and youth  clubs  will  become

popular  people's institutions which will help  to

bring our peoples of various races closer together

and  thereby  assist  us in  our  task  of  nation

building,  it  is most urgent therefore  that  the

People's   Association  should   be   incorporated

without any delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  concerning   the   People's

Association Bill which is tabled before the  House

now, we must thank the Minister for Labour and Law

for  introducing this significant and constructive

Bill which can be regarded as a valuable gift  for

our National Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware that the P.A.P. Government

will   not  follow  the  previous  Government   in

adopting   a   negative   attitude   towards   the

organisations, letting them emerge  and  disappear

by   themselves.  Our  aim  is  to  initiate   the

activities of the various organisations,  and  pay

due  regard to them. But public funds must be well

utilised  so  as to ensure that they will  not  be

wasted. Therefore, we must count every cent, which

is  to be spent. Then we will be able to carry out

the  maximum amount of work with the minimum  cost

for the benefit of the greatest number of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From clause 5 of this Bill, we can see clearly

that  the  Government has expressed  much  concern

about the development of the People's Association.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  one of the  reasons  why  the

P.A.P. has  today become the governing  Party  in

this  House is that we are getting the support  of

the people of Singa-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



pore.  The people of Singapore have given us their

support because of our spirit of dedicated service

to  them,  because  we share with  them  in  their

vicissitudes  and  because we work  together  with

them.  Our policy is based on this principle.  Our

attitude  now  in the discussion of this  Bill  is

also based on this guiding principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule on page 7 of the Bill reflects

accurately our point of view. In this Schedule  we

have   included   scouting  organisations,   youth

organisations, recreational organisations, student

bodies  or  old boys' associations, and  the  Fine

Arts Society. Also the Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan

Kebangsaan  which  was passed yesterday.  Although

only 45 organisations are set out in the Schedule,

yet  it  has a wide representation from among  the

existing statutory organisations in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting-up of the People's Association

is  a  matter worth our attention. It is the first

time  that the Government and public organisations

are  shouldering  the task of  providing  communal

recreational  activities. This  is  another  proof

that  this  Government is determined to  encourage

people to participate in Government organisations.

I   believe  that  with  the  initiative  of   the

Government, and with the assistance of the people,

the   organisation  and  the  development  of  the

activities of the People's Association will spread

swiftly like fire all over the Island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is expected that the activities of the

People's Association in the field of culture  will

be  widened. My colleague, the Minister for Labour

and  Law,  has  reiterated time and again  in  the

Press  that the Government will gradually increase

the  number  of  community centres.  However,  the

building of low-cost community centres is based on

the   Government's  economic  policy,   which   is

entirely   different   from   the   wasteful   and

unrealistic  policy of the past  Government.  Low-cost  community centres will be built up all  over

the  island, especially in the rural areas,  where

there is hardly any centre. Now the Government  is

looking  for  a site and as soon as  the  building

plans are ready, work will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



begin.  The  setting-up of  community  centres  is

consistent with our pledge to the people. In  Part

I page 4 of our Chinese pamphlet on P.A.P. policy,

we  have  stated that we need many small units  of

community centres or clubs in the rural areas.  We

will  look for suitable sites for the building  of

these centres. The past Government spent a lot  of

unwarranted money on a few beautiful and luxurious

centres  in urban areas, which were not  used  for

proper  recreational activities. There  is  urgent

need  for low-cost community centres in the  rural

areas so that the rural people can make use of and

enjoy the facilities provided by these centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government will make full use of

community centres for the purpose of carrying  out

the  aims contained in clause 10 (1) (b)  of  this

Bill.  That  is  to say, the People's  Association

will be responsible for the work of organising and

promoting culture and education. Singapore  has  a

multi-racial  society,  yet  the  past  Government

disregarded the importance of racial communication

and  contact. In the past, most of the people  who

participated  in community centre activities  were

English-educated people. The non-English  educated

people who participated were much less. This  one-sided  development is completely contrary  to  the

aim  of the People's Association and the community

centres.  As a result, we find there has  been  no

improvement  in communal customs and  usage.  Sir,

the  P.A.P. Government will not allow this  ailing

and  negative attitude to continue to develop. The

introduction of the People's Association  Bill  is

an  announcement of the death of the past  ruling

power  and the start of a new direction and spirit

in our work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present there are four

different streams of education in Singapore, which

are  using  their respective mother  tongue  as  a

medium  of  communication. So there is hardly  any

chance for association and understanding among the

students of these various streams except once in a

while when there may be some contact at a combined

schools sports meet. The mixed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



schools run by the Ministry of Education are still

in an experimental stage. Therefore, we must hurry

to  take action to check our weak points. The only

way  to  achieve  this is to set up  the  People's

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the new community centres will

open  the  door to young people of all  races  and

will  provide them with an opportunity which  they

lack in school. In other words, to enable them  to

make  use of the centres for friendly association,

study  and  work.  In this way  they  will  better

understand  their  respective  custom  and  usage,

which  will  help  to  improve  communication  and

promote racial culture. Furthermore, they can make

use  of  these  facilities to learn Malay  and  be

proficient  in  their conversations  and  writing.

This is of great significance in the evolution  of

a Malayan culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the 1957

population  census.  46  per  cent  of  our  total

population are people who are above 21 years  old,

whereas the number of people under 21 years  comes

to  53  per cent. Of this number, 46 per cent  are

teenagers  under  15 years old.  Furthermore,  the

school-going children make up 22 per cent  of  the

total population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the above percentages, we can see for

ourselves  that  more than  50  per  cent  of  our

population  are  young  people.  Therefore,  their

behaviour and conduct is a decisive factor in  the

interest  and future of our country. That  is  why

the  Government expresses much concern about their

conduct.   Because   prior   to   gaining   social

experiences,  our  young people  are  too  simple-

minded  and  their behaviour and ways of  thinking

are  easily  influenced by society. We must  teach

them to realise their importance to society and to

instil  in them a sense of national consciousness.

This  is  only one half of the work to be  carried

out   by   our   schools  and  by   the   People's

Association.  The  other half  of  the  work  will

depend  on the family. Sir, at present, there  are

certain  drawbacks in our society.  Many  parents,

once  they  have  sent their children  to  school,

leave the education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



of   their   children  entirely  to  the   school.

forgetting  their responsibilities  towards  their

children.  They fail to pay sufficient  regard  to

their   children,  so  that  their  children   are

influenced by the evil forces of society  and  get

themselves involved in criminal activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If every parent will consider the education of

his  children as his compulsory responsibility and

see  to their activities, then I believe that  the

youth  of  this country will have a bright  future

and  the State will benefit substantially from it.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I beg to support the  People's

Association  Bill.  We  are  all  aware  that  the

setting-up  of  the  People's Association  by  the

People's Action Party is of great significance. We

set  up  this People's Association for the purpose

of realising our Party aims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The units to be represented in the People's

Association  are  set out in the Schedule  of  the

Bill. The managing members include representatives

from  educational, cultural, recreational and  old

boys' associations. This People's Association  can

be  said  to  have  a full representation  of  the

existing   organisations   in   Singapore.    This

representation  also  reflects  the   Government's

attitude.   If   we   can   organise   all   these

organisations  under the People's Association  and

popularise it in every corner of the island, then,

on  the  one hand, it will be consistent with  our

Party  aim  to strengthen unity among the  various

races  of  the people, and, on the other hand,  we

can raise the cultural standards of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has expressed much concern about

the  living conditions of the people. The Minister

for   Labour  and  Law  has  announced  that   the

Government  will build many community centres  all

over  the  island. The setting-up of this People's

Association  will enable the people to participate

in community activities. This Association will not

only improve communications between the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



all  races  but  will also raise  the  educational

standards  and  cultural  understanding   of   the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me tell you something about the

conditions  of the community centres in  the  past

Government  and why I support this  Bill.  In  the

past,  the attitude towards community centres  was

negative and was a departure from the wish of  the

masses of the people. They very seldom went to the

community centres and made' use of them.  I  know,

from  my  visits,  that certain community  centres

still  have the sign. "Beware of Dogs" hanging  on

the  door.  Formerly, good results  were  expected

from   grand  exhibitions  like  the  Agricultural

Exhibition.  But,  on  the  contrary,  there  were

instances  of gambling like tikam, and  facilities

were  provided  for the people to  gamble  in  the

community centres. Therefore, it can be seen  that

community  centres in the past  were  not  run  on

proper   lines,  Because  of  this,   the   P.A.P.

Government took over these community centres  with

the  object  of  uniting the people  of  different

races  and  to bring them closer to the Government

so  as to understand its policies. These community

centres   act  as  a  liaison  body  between   the

Government  and the people, thereby breaking  down

the barrier that existed between them in the past.

If  we have the People's Association, we will then

be  able  to  teach these people  to  become  good

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, in the guise of

community  centres,  many bad deeds,  took  place.

Therefore,  our  aim  is to unite  the  people  of

different races together and to promote friendship

among them through cultural activities in order to

show them a better way of life. As members of  the

People's   Association,  the  people  will   fully

realise  that they can have their aims  satisfied.

Therefore,  the  work to be  done  will  be  fully

appreciated by them. The community centres will be

centres for their activities and they will be able

to voice their wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the People's

Association Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 15 inclusive ordered to stand part

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the Schedule stand part

of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

have  been a few inadvertent omissions.  I  wonder

whether this is another inadvertent omission.  The

sports   movement,   the  professional   movement,

international  movements  like  the   St.   John's

Ambulance  Association, the  Federation  of  Boys'

Clubs and the Girl Guides Association, etc.,  the

educational  movement, the cultural movement,  the

youth  movement, the students' movement,  and  the

trade  union  movement have all been  represented.

The  Minister  who  professes himself  to  be  the

champion of women has omitted the women. I  wonder

whether  that  is  an inadvertent  or  sentimental

omission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain, Sir, that the Girls' Life Brigade

and  the Federation of Girls' Club do not actually

represent  the women, especially the latter  which

is run by men and women admittedly for the good of

young   girls.  Actually,  these  clubs   do   not

represent the women.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Girls and women are not

synonymous!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have tried to

produce  as  comprehensive a Schedule as  possible

and  we  do not claim, in doing so, that  we  have

been  perfect.  When the People's  Association  is

constituted, any associations which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



feel  that  they should be included  could  always

write  in  to  the  People's Association  and  the

inclusion   of   those   associations   will    be

considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Mountbatten will look at

clause  5 of the Bill, she will see that there  is

provision  for  amendments  to  be  made  to   the

Schedule  by notification in the Gazette with  the

approval of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

grateful  to the Minister for the explanation  and

the assurance given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments; read the Third

time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill repeals the Trade Unions Ordinance but

re-enacts  its principal provisions with additions

and   amendments.  As  will  be  seen   from   the

Comparative  Table attached to the Bill,  many  of

the  provisions of the Bill have been  taken  from

the  Federation  Trade Unions Ordinance  of  1959.

Federations  of trade unions are not  included  in

the  definition of "trade union" and,  as  in  the

Federation Ordinance; special provisions are  made

in  regard  to them in Part VIII of the Bill.  The

Bill, however, extends to branches of trade unions

provisions,  which were not formerly  extended  to

them.  Particulars of branches and their executive

and  officers must be included in the  application

for registration under clause 10, the formation or

dissolution  of a branch must be notified  to  the

Registrar  under  clause 27  and  changes  in  the

officers  of  a  branch and the situation  of  its

office  must likewise be notified to the Registrar

under clauses 31 and 32.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in clause 11 makes important changes in

the  conditions, which must be complied with by  a

trade  union,  which applies for registration.  If

the trade union is a trade union of employees,  it

must be an association of employees within one  of

the  categories set out in the First  Schedule  to

the Ordinance; it must (unless this requirement is

waived    by    the   Registrar   in   exceptional

circumstances) have at least 250 members;  and  it

must  be  affiliated  to an association  of  trade

unions  exempted by the Minister under section  59

of  the Ordinance. In the case of a trade union of

employees  the trade union must be an  association

of   employees  within  a  trade,  occupation   or

industry   or   within  trades,   occupations   or

industries  which  are  in  the  opinion  of   the

Registrar similar. Moreover the objects, rules and

constitution   of   all   trade   unions   seeking

registration  must  comply  with  and   must   not

conflict  with the provisions of the Ordinance  or

any  regulations made thereunder and the rules and

constitution of the trade union must be democratic

and  provide  for  proper  representation  of  the

members  in the management of the affairs  of  the

trade union. The application for registration must

state the names, occupations and addresses of  the

members of the trade union signing the application

and  the  titles, names, addresses and occupations

of  the  officers of the trade union and  of  each

branch  of the trade union. I propose, Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, to move at the Committee  Stage  of

the   Bill  an  amendment  to  provide  that   the

application for registration shall also state  the

names,  ages, addresses and occupations of members

of  the  executive of the trade union and of  each

branch  thereof and also of members of a committee

provision  for which is made in the rules  of  the

trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequential changes have also been made in

clause  14  to  the  conditions  under  which  the

registration  of a trade union can  be  cancelled.

Power  is  given to cancel the registration  of  a

trade  union  of employees if the trade  union  is

being used against the interests of employees in a

trade, occupation or industry in which its members

are  engaged, or if it has less than 250  members,

or if it has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



ceased to be affiliated to an association of trade

unions  exempted by the Minister under section  59

of the Ordinance. Moreover, the Registrar is given

power  to cancel the registration of a trade union

if he is of the opinion that, having regard to the

existence  of  another trade  union  of  employees

registered in respect of the same category set out

in  the  First Schedule to the Ordinance to  which

the  trade union belongs, it is necessary  in  the

interests  of  the  employees in  that  particular

trade,  occupation  or  industry,  to  cancel  the

registration of the trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions relating to the constitution of

trade  unions have also been amended. A person  is

disqualified in clause 28 from being an officer of

a  trade  union, or any branch thereof or  of  any

federation of trade unions or the person in charge

of  a subsidiary local office of a trade union, if

he is not either a citizen of Singapore or born in

the  Federation of Malaya or he has been convicted

for  the illegal expenditure or use of trade union

funds or of criminal breach of trust, extortion or

criminal intimidation. In this respect, I  propose

to  move an amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at

the Committee Stage of the Bill to provide that  a

person shall not be a member of an executive of  a

trade  union  if  he  has been convicted  for  the

illegal expenditure or use of trade union funds or

of criminal breach of trust, extortion or criminal

intimidation. The Bill also provides in clause  29

that a person shall not be employed as an employee

of  a  trade union if he has been convicted  of  a

criminal  offence. Power is given to the  Minister

in  clause 30 to exempt any trade union or  person

from  the provisions relating to disqualifications

and also to rule that the disqualification arising

from  conviction  shall  not  apply  where  he  is

satisfied  that  the  person  convicted  has  been

reformed.  In  Committee, I  shall  be  moving  an

amendment  to clause 30 to enable the Minister  to

exempt   a   union  of  employers   from   certain

provisions of the Bill where it will be impossible

for such union to comply with these provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum age for membership of a trade union

will  be  lowered from 18 to 16 years, but members

under 18



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



years  of  age  will not be eligible  to  vote  on

certain  matters. This is provided for  in  clause

25.  The names and titles of all officers  of  the

trade  union  and the branch are  required  to  be

notified, and changes in the holders of the office

or  in the title of the office must be notified to

the   Registrar,  who  will  alter  the   register

accordingly,  if satisfied that the provisions  of

the rules of the trade union, of the Ordinance and

of  the  regulations  made  thereunder  have  been

complied with. I propose, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

at  the  Committee  Stage to  move  amendments  to

clause   31  to  provide  that  changes   in   the

membership of the executive of the trade union  or

of its branches or of any committee, provision for

which  is  made in the rules of the  trade  union,

shall similarly be notified to the Registrar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions relating to the rules of a

registered trade union are amended in clause 33 to

provide that such rules must not conflict with the

provisions  of  an  award or collective  agreement

made  under the Industrial Courts Ordinance or  be

such  as to prevent or hinder members of the trade

union from complying therewith and that such rules

must  not  impose on applicants for membership  or

members  obligations  or  restrictions  which  are

oppressive, unreasonable or unjust. The rules  are

required  to  make provisions for all the  matters

specified  in the Second Schedule to the Ordinance

in  which  paragraphs 3 and 4 are new and  require

the  rules  to state the category set out  in  the

First  Schedule  to the Ordinance  or  the  trade,

occupation  or industry to which the  trade  union

belongs  and  the  conditions of  eligibility  for

membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 34 (1), alterations to the rules,

which  specify the category of trade union or  the

trade, occupation or industry in which members  of

the trade union are engaged and the conditions  of

eligibility for membership, require the consent of

the Registrar. In clause 34 (2), other alterations

to the rules may be registered if the Registrar is

satisfied that they will not cause the rules to be

in  conflict with the provisions of the  Ordinance

or the regulations made thereunder.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 38 power is given to a trade union to

change  its name by a resolution of the  executive

of the trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is also given in clause 39 to two or more

registered   trade  unions  within  one   of   the

categories  set out in the First Schedule  to  the

Ordinance or within similar trades, occupations or

industries, to amalgamate as one trade  union  and

this  can  be  done by a resolution  passed  at  a

general  meeting  of  members  of  each   of   the

registered  trade  unions  after  service  on  the

Registrar  and all members of the trade  union  of

notice of the proposed resolution not less than 14

days  prior to the date of the meeting.  After  an

amalgamation  has  been effected,  any  registered

trade  union  within the same  category  of  trade

unions may amalgamate with the amalgamated body if

the  votes  of  at least one half of  the  members

entitled  to vote are recorded at a secret  ballot

and at least 60 per cent of the votes recorded are

in  favour of amalgamation. Provision is made  for

the  vesting of property upon amalgamation in  the

appropriate  trustees  in  accordance   with   the

instrument of amalgamation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particulars of the trustees of a trade union and

of  changes  of trustees must be notified  to  and

registered  by  the  Registrar.  A  secretary   or

treasurer  of a trade union may not be a  trustee,

but a corporation may. It is provided in clause 44

that  upon a change of a trustee, which  has  been

duly  registered, the trust property will vest  in

the  new trustees without transfer, conveyance and

assignment or order of court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision has been made, following the Federation

Trade Unions Ordinance, to permit a trade union to

establish  a  separate political fund  from  which

payments  may  be made in furtherance  of  defined

political objects. Only those members who formally

accept   the  obligation  to  contribute  to   the

political fund will be liable to contribute to  it

and  no  payment may be made in furtherance  of  a

political  object except from the political  fund.

This is provided for in clause 47.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Registrar has reasonable cause to

believe  that  the funds of a trade union  may  be

applied for unauthorised purposes he may by  order

freeze  the bank account of the trade union.  This

is provided for in clause 49.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part VIII of the Bill, two or more registered

trade unions within one of the categories set  out

in  the  First Schedule to the Ordinance or within

similar  trades,  occupations or  industries,  may

form  or create a federation of trade unions by  a

resolution  passed at the general meeting  of  the

members of each of the trade unions. The rules  of

a federation shall make provisions for the matters

specified  in the Fifth Schedule to the Ordinance.

The objects for which the federation is formed are

required  to  be  set  out in  the  rules  of  the

federation,  and  these  must  comply   with   the

provisions  of the Fifth Schedule. The  federation

may guide and co-ordinate the lawful activities of

its component unions, but has no power to take any

active  part  in  conciliation proceedings  or  in

trade  disputes on behalf of the trade union.  The

procedure   for  affiliation  with  a   registered

federation  is laid down, and it is provided  that

the  general provisions of the Ordinance  relating

to trade unions will apply to federations of trade

unions except so far as the Minister may otherwise

order



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is given to the Minister to exempt an

association of trade unions from the provisions of

the  Ordinance after examination and  approval  of

the  rules of such association. The rules of  such

an  exempted  association  shall  not  be  changed

without  the  written permission of the  Minister.

This is provided for in clause 59.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions registered under the existing Trade

Unions  Ordinance will be deemed to be  registered

trade  unions,  but the Registrar may  within  the

period  of  one year from the date of  the  coming

into   operation  of  the  Ordinance  cancel   the

registration  of such a trade union  if,  being  a

trade union of employees, it is not within one  of

the categories specified in the First Schedule  or

is  not  affiliated  to  an association  of  trade

unions  exempted by the Minister under section  59

of  the  Ordinance or if, being a trade  union  of

employers, it is not an association or combination

of employers in a trade,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



occupation  or  industry  or  in  similar  trades,

occupations or industries. The Registrar may  also

within such period cancel the registration of such

a  trade union if the rules of the trade union  do

not  comply with or are contrary to the provisions

of   the   Ordinance   or  any  regulations   made

thereunder   or  if,  being  a  trade   union   of

employees,  it  has less than 250 members  or  has

ceased to be affiliated to an association of trade

unions  exempted by the Minister under section  59

of  the  Ordinance, or if the proper authority  of

the  trade union has wilfully neglected to provide

for the levying or collection of subscriptions and

fees  from  its  members;  but  the  Registrar  is

required in such cases to give notice to the trade

union  and to give it an opportunity to show cause

why the registration should not be cancelled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federations of trade unions which are registered

under the existing Trade Unions Ordinance will  be

required  to reapply for registration  within  six

months of the date of the coming into operation of

the  Ordinance.  If a federation of  trade  unions

fails  to  do  so,  or  if  its  application   for

registration is refused, it shall be deemed to  be

an unlawful association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of miscellaneous amendments have also

been   made  to  strengthen  the  powers  of   the

Registrar.  Power  is given to him  to  require  a

person  to  attend before him and answer questions

and  produce  documents relating to the  existence

and  operation  of  any trade union  or  suspected

trade  union. Power is also given to the Registrar

to  inspect ballot papers and other documents used

in  connection  with a ballot and it  is  provided

that  all  such  papers  and  documents  shall  be

preserved for six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, speaking on this

Trade  Unions  Bill,  I would  like  to  draw  the

attention of the Minister for Labour and Law to my

adjournment  speech  made  in  this  Assembly   in

February  last. If my memory serves me  right,  in

that  speech I stressed that it was essential  for

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



Government to ensure that the officials of a trade

union  should  comprise Singapore  citizens  only.

However,  in this Trade Unions Bill, there  is  an

amendment to the effect that persons born  in  the

Federation are eligible to become officials  of  a

trade  union. From the point of view of  U.M.N.O.,

the   wide  opportunities  offered,  without   any

specific   mention  that  persons  born   in   the

Federation should first become Singapore  citizens

are   undesirable.  In  its  fight   to   suppress

subversive   elements   in   Singapore   and   the

Federation, it is necessary for the Government  to

keep a watchful eye on the trade union leadership.

But  we  are compelled to seek clarification  from

the  Government on this point. What  will  be  the

fate of the Government if the leaders of the trade

unions   wrest  control  from  them  and  exercise

influence on them? In that situation, I  am  quite

sure,  Mr Deputy Speaker, the question  of  peace

will have to be considered not only in relation to

the  internal  security  situation,  but  also  in

relation  to  the defence of our  State  from  the

Communist  threat. We consider it most undesirable

for  such  men to participate in the  trade  union

movement. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, on behalf

of  the  U.M.N.O., we have brought this matter  to

this  Assembly. We have given our  views,  but  we

have  not  received  a  positive  reply  from  the

Minister for Labour and Law.



<br><br>4.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the passing of the Industrial Relations Bill

established the future course on which  the  trade

unions in Singapore would follow in pursuing their

claims  in  future. In fact, a new era will  begin

with  the implementation of the provisions of that

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unions will have to adhere to sense

and  logic, and will have to exercise greater care

in  the preparation of their claims. In the  past,

the   law   of  the  jungle  prevailed.  Employers

recognised  and  respected  larger  and   stronger

unions, but took advantage of the weakness of  the

smaller  and  less militant unions.  But  now  the

situation has changed. The future prospects of the

working  class in Singapore depend on the  ability

of the individual unions to prepare and present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



a sound case for judgment by an independent court.

Sir,  I  say  that it is in this context  that  we

should  examine  the merits of this  Trade  Unions

Bill before us today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody in his proper senses can deny the fact

that  when this Bill is passed, and its provisions

are   implemented,   the   unification   and   the

strengthening   of   the  workers'   movement   in

Singapore will be helped greatly. In the past,  in

the  good old days of the previous Government, the

trade  union  movement  as  a  whole  was  one  of

ridicule. There were more than 200 trade unions in

Singapore, each ranging in membership from  30,000

to  nothing,  and more than 50 per cent  of  these

unions  ranged in membership from nothing to  only

about  250. And in many cases, the smaller  unions

were yellow and splinter unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the elections, the P.A.P. pledged to wipe

out these yellow and splinter unions and encourage

the healthy growth of the movement. As soon as the

Government  was constituted, we went  about  doing

this. Today a number of splinter and yellow unions

has  been  forcibly removed from  the  arena,  and

there are some on the waiting list. In due course,

they will be removed too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main features of the Trade Unions Bill

are   (1)   the   requirement  of   a   democratic

constitution and proper representation of  members

in  the  management of the affairs of the  unions;

(2)  the  requirement of a minimum number  of  250

members for registration and the categories of the

unions;  and  (3)  compulsory  affiliation  to  an

association of trade unions, i.e., at the  moment,

the T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we encourage proportional

representation  as  far  as  possible.  There  are

unions  in Singapore where a minority manages  the

affairs of a majority. And it has been found often

that  not  only  the  views and  interest  of  the

majority went unheard, but also suppressed by  the

use  of  some  constitutional technicalities.  For

example,   the   Army  Civil  Service   Union   in

Singapore,  where  some 12,000 industrial  workers

are  not  properly represented in their  executive

which  is  dominated  by a  minority  of  clerical

workers. And secondly, the require-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



ment  of  250 members for the registration  of  an

employees'  union and the necessity  to  have  the

unions  within  the  categories  set  out  in  the

Schedule  are vital if we are to have  unification

of the movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, the previous Government was more

democratic   in  that  they  allowed   thugs   and

black-legs  to  form unions. Therefore,  we  had  a

string  of unions operated by racketeers who  were

ever   prepared  to  break  strikes   and   supply

black-legs.  Seven workers could form a union.  And

if  the  applicants had the blessings of notorious

men  like  Lee  Yew Seng, then the Government  and

employers  made  sure that they received  all  the

support  for the furtherance of the objectives  of

these  people,  although  their  objectives   were

fundamentally  opposed to the  aspiration  of  the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no matter how liberal one decides to be, it

is  nonsense to allow every Tom. Dick and Harry to

form  a union, because, finally, what we will have

are  as many unions as workers, and that would  be

absurdity  at  its  height.  It  is  a  matter  of

principle to have one union in one industry.  This

is  the  basic  phenomena  in  aid  of  collective

bargaining. And any Government worth its salt must

endeavour to establish this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now almost one year since the election

took place and this Government constituted. During

this   period,  many  changes  have  taken  place,

changes  by and large benefiting the workers.  The

office of the Minister for Labour and Law has been

transformed  from  a bureaucratic  agency  of  the

employers  in  the  past  to  a  fair   and   just

institution,  ever  vigilant  to  check   ruthless

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the significance of the change is simply

this.  In  the past the trade unions had not  only

the employers to face, but also the Government.  A

Government  which claimed to be popularly  elected

but  which  had its heart and soul pawned  to  the

employers; whereas now the position has been  made

clear.  The Government is undoubtedly on the  side

of  the workers, and this has been stated time and

again,  and it has been proved by words and deeds.

In requiring 250 members as the minimum number for

the  registration of a trade union, the Government

is being extremely fair, because,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



in the first place, no thug is going to organise a

yellow  union  and no pimp is going  to  have  the

opportunity to organise a splinter union.  Because

experience  has  proved  that  these  people   are

incapable of mustering the strength. But if  there

should  be a legitimate case, which I think  would

be  a  remote possibility, because existing unions

cover  almost all industries, then I am  sure  the

provision will be well met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not intend to usurp the

right   of  the  unions  to  participate  in   the

unification of the movement, and setting  out  the

categories  in the Schedule is merely establishing

a  basis  for  the unions to work on. Without  the

provisions of the Bill and without the eradication

of  splinter and yellow unions, if we are to  hope

for  the unification of the movement, I would say,

speaking  from  my own experience, that  it  would

take   at   least  ten  years  for  the  hope   to

materialise. Therefore, in brief, what  this  Bill

seeks  to do is to propel the development  of  the

trade union movement forward, and to encourage the

unification of the movement. And I am certain that

with  the  passing  of  this  Bill  and  with  the

implementation of its provisions, we will  have  a

stronger, a healthier and a unified movement in  a

very  short  time, perhaps in about  a  couple  of

years' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the question of compulsory

affiliation  I would say this. Whether  compulsion

is  democratic or not is futile to  ask.  What  is

important  is whether it is desirable. Slogans  on

democratic principles are beautiful but  they  are

meaningless  if  the  results  they  produce   are

undesirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution of the T.U.C. has been amended

and  the organisation is being geared to meet  the

new  situation. The future, as I envisage it, will

create   a   democratic  centralization   of   the

movement. But there are all sorts of wild talk  in

town.  Wild talk about the so-called 10 Tall  Men.

But this is far too stupid to demand attention and

to require clarification. But what I wish to point

out  is this. In the final analysis, it is not the

Secretary-General or the Secretariat of the T.U.C.

which will decide, but the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



workers   themselves.  The   political   pace   in

Singapore  is  set  and dictated  by  the  working

class.  Governments may change, personalities  may

fade,  but  the  grim reminder of reality  is  the

temper  of  the working class, which will  be  the

deciding factor, and history will continue  to  be

made.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving

the  Second Reading of the Bill, the Minister gave

a  very sober account of the reasons that prompted

the  Government to introduce this Bill. But it was

left  to a backbencher to take it upon himself  to

speak  on behalf of the Government and to go  into

matters, which were not touched on by the Minister

in his speech at all. As was to be expected, there

was  reference  made of the work of  the  previous

Government vis-a-vis the trade union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Government was accused of being on

the  side  of  employers, of trying to  choke  the

healthy growth of the trade union movement and  of

a  number of other crimes perpetrated against  the

trade unions in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, if one were to be honest with one's

self and if one were to go through the records  of

the  industrial strife that took place during  the

life  of  the previous Government, one would  have

arrived at the conclusion that it was a lamentable

fact  that the trade unions in Singapore  at  that

time had been misguided and had been made use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



of by people who did not have the interests of the

country nor the interests of the workers at heart.

Sir,  I  do not think it is a good thing  that  we

should  go  into  detail as to what  the  previous

Government had done or had not done. Let us rather

confine  ourselves to the Bill that is before  the

House.  The  Bill, as the Minister has  said,  has

incorporated a number of sections that are already

in existence and also sections of the Trade Unions

Bill in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, however, has departed in two

directions.  One is that it is now felt  that  the

officers  of a trade union should only  come  from

those who are citizens of Singapore or people born

in the Federation of Malaya. Another one is that a

trade union, if it is to be registered, must first

of all be affiliated to the Trades Union Congress,

which  obviously  will  get  exemption  from   the

Minister  under clause 59. The Minister also  goes

on to say that any registered trade union can have

its  registration withdrawn if  it  is  no  longer

affiliated to the T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been pointed out in this House by

the Member for Kampong Kembangan that the time has

come for control of the trade unions to be in  the

hands  of  the citizens of Singapore, and  I  feel

that  clause 28 introduced by the Government  does

not  go far enough. On the one hand, Sir, we  will

be   debating   later   on  on   the   Citizenship

(Amendment) Bill. In that Bill we are going to  be

asked  to  approve steps to make it more difficult

for people to become citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship, Sir, is and must be the very

treasure  of a man living in Singapore. It  should

open  to him, and it has opened to him, many gates

of opportunities in Singapore. If it is really the

desire of the Government to make it more difficult

for   people  to  become  citizens  of  Singapore,

surely,  the  same must be made in this  instance,

that  in so far as the control of the trade unions

is concerned, it should be left in the hands of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



people  who  are citizens of Singapore.  The  fact

that  the  Government has, by this Bill,  made  it

possible  for  people born in  the  Federation  to

become officers of a trade union -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether

it  would not be more convenient if those  remarks

could  be made in the Committee stage where  there

is, in fact, a proposed amendment dealing with the

matter being raised now. The Member for Cairnhill,

of course, is perfectly entitled to carry on if he

wishes  to in that strain. But I thought it  would

be  much  more convenient if he would discuss  the

point in Committee, where there is opportunity  to

speak  more than once; otherwise, there  might  be

considerable repetition.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I agree with you, Sir. But I

have  brought it up because in the Second  Reading

of the Bill, the Minister touched on this point. I

will,  however,  bring up this particular  subject

when  the  clause is being discussed in Committee.

But  one  has the feeling, Sir, that in trying  to

throw  the  officership of trade  unions  open  to

people born in the Federation, it is just to  make

this law suit the needs of the P.A.P. Surely, Sir,

in  legislating, the Government should always  pay

attention to the needs of the country rather  than

the needs of the Party in power. But one comes  to

the  conclusion  that, because of this  particular

clause  and of another clause, clause 30, against

which  I will speak, all these things are done  to

suit the P.A.P. Sir, one cannot divorce one's mind

from  the  fact that before the Second Reading  of

this  Bill, all steps have already been  taken  by

P.A.P. trade union leaders to control the  Trades

Union  Congress. If one were to believe  what  one

read in the newspapers, then one would come to the

conclusion that there was great rejoicing  in  the

minds of the Front Benchers of the Government when

they  were addressing a mass rally on May Day.  It

was  the  Minister for Labour and  Law  who  said,

"From now on, no trade union can exist, unless and

until it is affiliated to the T.U.C."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no objection to insisting or

requiring that a registered trade union should  be

affiliated to the T.U.C. That is taking the  right

step  to  encourage a healthy trade union movement

and  to unify the movement. But to say that unless

and  until  a  trade  union is affiliated  to  the

T.U.C. it cannot be registered is just to say that

the   Government   is  prepared   to   allow   the

administration of this important part of  the  law

to  be  given to the T.U.C. It will no  longer  be

possible for the Registrar of Trade Unions to say,

"We register you", or "We cannot register you." It

will  just be left to the T.U.C. to say that.  The

hands  of  the Registrar of Trade Unions  will  be

tied.  Of  course,  I am sure the  Government  now

feels  that, because the T.U.C. is in the  control

of  its Party members, it will not be difficult to

use  that  as an extra arm to choke any opposition

from  trade  unions, which do  not  desire  to  be

affiliated to the T.U.C. for obvious reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will remember that not very long

after the P.A.P. came into power, the Minister for

Labour and Law said, "We will do everything we can

to  encourage the growth of national unions." That

was  said  about some 8 or 9 months ago, and  from

what I can see, the encouragement of the growth of

national  unions  since then has been  a  failure.

There have been so few national unions formed.  In

fact, there has been an attempt on the part of the

P.A.P. to  start an amalgamated union  of  public

employees.  That is to say, a national  union  for

all  public  employees. I do not think that  union

has made any headway, because many trade unions do

not and cannot have confidence in that amalgamated

union  of public employees in so far as it is  run

and controlled by the Party in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clause, Sir, in this particular Bill

which says that it shall be an offence on the part

of  an employer to encourage the establishment  of

any  trade union and to encourage any trade  union

leader  to  do  things which are inimical  to  the

trade  union  movement. And yet here we  have  the

Government as an employer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



organising  a trade union to encourage  its  civil

servants to join their trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson has tacitly

admitted,  thereby insisting, that  unions  should

affiliate to the T.U.C. "It is not democratic. But

what  is democracy after all? Let us see if it  is

desirable." And he left it at that. He should have

continued  and  said,  "It  is  desirable  in  the

interest of the P.A.P. that trade unions should be

forced to join the T.U.C. which is, after all,  as

it is today, an organisation or another arm of the

P.A.P.



<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in the  last  five  years  in

Singapore,   we   have  witnessed  several   trade

disputes   and  incidents  affecting  the   labour

movement.   What  were  the  reasons?   The   past

Government  encouraged  the  formation  of   trade

unions  in factories to such an extent that  there

existed two or three trade unions in each factory.

The  purpose of these unions was to cause conflict

among them and the workers themselves. That is how

yellow unions came to be formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill said

that  the  T.U.C. was nothing but an  organisation

merely  to hoodwink the people in order to  obtain

publicity.  But  we  have seen  how  the  previous

Government  made use of its henchmen to  help  the

employers  to  oppose genuine trade unions,  which

were fighting for the rights of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill that is before us

today is a Bill, which is designed to protect  the

workers and the trade union movement in Singapore.

With the passing of this Bill, I am confident that

the  safety  of the people and of the trade  union

movement  in  Singapore will be ensured,  although

the  Opposition  still feel uneasy.  However,  the

Government  is determined to show, by  deeds,  its

sincerity to the people and to the Opposition.  We

are not afraid of accusations levelled against  us

if we are confident that what we are doing is good

for the people. The Government will continue to do

its  good work in order to gain the confidence  of

the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

speak  on  the  Trade Unions Bill before  us  this

afternoon, although there may be allegations  made

against me that I have no right to speak on  trade

unionism  on  the grounds that I am  not  a  trade

union leader. I am not particularly concerned with

the  rights  of the trade union movement  or  with

matters  concerning trade unionism  in  Singapore,

but  I wish to speak in the interest of the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the object of this Bill is to consolidate the

trade  union movement and to protect and safeguard

the  interest of the workers, nobody can deny that

the  trade union movement in Singapore: should  be

unified  in the interest of the workers.  However,

there has been marked dissatisfaction expressed by

certain sections of the trade union movement  with

the  attitude of certain trade union leaders whose

tactics appear to indicate that they will make use

of  the  power  at their disposal to coerce  every

trade  union  to  join  their  trade  union.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, if this kind of attitude is  adopted

by the trade union leaders who are in power today,

we  cannot  blame  some of  the  workers  who  are

reluctant to take part in this unified trade union

movement. For example, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

draw  the  attention of this House to  the  Sunday

Mail of 1st May:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English): "One of the leaders, Inche Buang

bin   Omar  Junid,  P.A.P.  Assemblyman   who   is

Secretary-General of the T.U.C.  (Accounts),  said

that  there were some workers who preferred to  go

home and sleep after their day's work; others  who

preferred  to  help  their  employers.  `To  these

people  I say it is better that you join  a  union

because  if you don't, we will fight you and  wipe

you out.'"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay): Mr Speaker, Sir, it should not be

taken  for  granted that speeches of  this  nature

will  frighten those who refuse to be coerced.  As

people, they have the right to choose to speak and

to  engage in any way of life that is lawful. They

will  not be frightened in the least, because,  if

compulsion   is   used  to  match  strength   with

strength, then those who have faith in godliness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



will be prepared to fight any form of compulsion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the provisions in the

Bill compels trade unions to be affiliated to  the

T.U.C. and many trade unions have expressed  their

dissatisfaction   with  the   state   of   affairs

prevailing in the T.U.C. But, unfortunately, these

trade unions cannot voice their grievances for the

reason  that  it  seems  that  in  the  State   of

Singapore  there  are many forms  of  control  and

there  is coercion - not only in the field of trade

unionism but also (we have seen the action of  the

Government) in the field of education, and so  on.

But   we,   on  the  Opposition,  have  faith   in

democracy.  The present Government is  a  majority

Government  elected by the people. If  the  people

are not happy with the present Government, I think

this  is  not  the  place to  oppose  it.  If  the

Government think it fit to consider and weigh  our

views  and amend their ways, they can withdraw  so

that  Singapore can be built up by people who  owe

complete allegiance to the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, to

which  I  would like to draw attention.  We  still

remember  the  tactics  employed  by  trade  union

leaders five years ago in an attempt to bring  the

workers into their orbit. In the presence  of  the

masses,  they  are prepared to talk  about  making

sacrifices, to thump the table, toss their caps in

the air, and make fiery speeches. If he is a Sikh,

for instance, he is prepared to shave his beard in

the  presence of the masses as though to  indicate

that  he is a genuine trade union leader.  But  as

stated by the Member for Cairnhill, where are they

heading  for?  Are  they  sincerely  leading   the

workers  of Singapore to prosperity? This  is  the

question,  and this has been the cause of  concern

among the masses.



<br><br>6.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, when the first Trade Unions Ordinance, indeed

the present Trade Unions Ordinance, was introduced

in  this country in 1941, it was introduced  by  a

Colonial Government. The purpose and the desire of

that Government was to create only an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



impression that trade unionism was allowed in  the

Colony,  that  they could go to the  international

forums,    like    the    International     Labour

Organisation,  and say, "Yes, we  have  introduced

trade unionism."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a colonial Government, as everyone knows, is

nothing   but   an   agent  or  an  administrative

machinery  for  the capitalists who exploited  our

country. It was clearly and cleverly designed that

the  Trade Unions Ordinance would never  be  given

the opportunity for a strong, effective, organised

and  disciplined movement to be created, but  that

at  all  time we would have a trade union movement

that  was  splintered, weak and ineffective.  That

was  the  position, one might say, until September

1959.   When   the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance   was

introduced, which made it possible for  any  seven

persons to form a union, then right from the  word

go there was no possibility of creating a good and

strong  union. If any person was disaffected  with

democratic decisions arrived at by a union, all he

had to do was to gather another six friends of his

and   form  a  union.  When  that  was  done,  the

employers  were  not  very  slow  at  seizing  the

opportunity before them. Thus we found racketeers,

opportunists,    political    adventurers - everyone

joining in the game and forming unions. Employers,

too,  found it more profitable to have unions  led

by  their  own agents and to make side deals  with

them than to negotiate with the genuine unions and

reach agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the root of the riots which

took  place not long ago was inter union  rivalry.

There  was a company union - a yellow union - a  union

deliberately  created  by the  employers  for  the

purpose of destroying a good, genuine union, which

had  the  majority support of all the  workers  in

that industry. In that set-up, Sir, it was natural

that  Government  had no intention  whatsoever  of

creating  a  trade union centre or a Trades  Union

Congress as we find it in other countries. Indeed,

in  Singapore for a long time, before  the  Trades

Union  Congress  was registered  under  the  Trade

Union Ordinance, there was discussion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



between  the  Government  and  the  trade   unions

whether the T.U.C. should be registered under  the

Societies  Ordinance  or under  the  Trade  Unions

Ordinance.   Finally,  when  it  was  decided   to

register  it under the Trade Unions Ordinance, it

was  nothing more than another union. It  did  not

have   more  powers  than  any  other   union   in

Singapore. Among the 225 unions in Singapore, the

T.U.C. was just another union. Not only  did  the

Ordinance  make and keep the T.U.C. so,  but  also

the  officials of the Ministry of Labour, and even

the  political  chiefs, kept the  T.U.C. in  that

manner.    I    remember,    Sir,    the    T.U.C.

representatives  being invited to discuss  certain

labour  problems.  At the same meeting  one  would

find  representatives of some unions  which  never

had  a membership of more than 200. How then could

the  T.U.C. claim to be speaking for all  labour,

and  how  could the unions want to affiliate  with

the  T.U.C. when  they knew that they  themselves

could  represent all labour, depending on who  was

the political chief of the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, previously we had trade union advisers who

were sent to our country to advise trade unions on

how  to  organise trade unions and how to  set  up

rules. But no one needs trade union advisers  from

another country to come here and advise us on  how

unions  should  be  set  up.  There  are  men   in

Singapore  capable  of  organising  and   managing

unions. But what was the role of those trade union

advisers?  Their  role was  nothing  but  to  kill

militancy  and  to destroy any coordinated  action

among the unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill touched on the

subject  of  the  T.U.C. and said that  the  trade

unions  should affiliate with it. Yet in the  same

breath  he  said that affiliation  to  the  T.U.C.

should  not be made compulsory. As long as  it  is

possible  for  unions to remain in Singapore,  get

all  the benefits that the T.U.C. can provide, and

yet  not  bear the responsibility for  that  work,

then  there will be unions who will not  affiliate

not  because  the members want it so, but  because

the  leaders want it so. The Member for  Cairnhill

also touched upon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



unions  being  created  by Government  the  T.U.C.

being led by the Party men. As usual, Sir, he  has

been  trying  his best not so much  to  put  facts

before  this  House,  as  to  put  out  the  party

propaganda line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1959 there were 225 unions. Of this

number,  over  60 unions were splinter  or  yellow

unions.  Now, if these unions had been allowed  to

exist,  we would have found ourselves no doubt  in

the  same  position as the people found themselves

in  1956 and 1957. So rightly this Government  had

the  Ordinance passed whereby splinter and  yellow

unions can be de-registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one aspect of the job of creating a

unified  movement.  In  this  Bill,  it  has  been

provided that the number of persons who can form a

union  has been increased from 7 to 250. This  has

been  deliberately done in order  to  ensure  that

unless  and  until  250 workmen  in  a  particular

category  or occupation are desirous of forming  a

union, then no union should be registered. It also

affords  the  possibility,  at  the  time  of  re-registration,  for  so  many  other  unions  whose

membership  is  now below 250 to be cancelled.  In

this  way, it will be possible to create  national

unions,  unions which do not poach on each other's

territory,  unions  which will  have  a  specified

industry or organisation or craft from which  they

can recruit members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade union movement has been classified

into  19  industrial groups, and the unions  which

are  on  the register will be placed according  to

the  membership in each one of these  groups.  But

the  rules  for  federation and amalgamation  have

been   simplified  particularly  the   rules   for

amalgamation, thus  showing  a  preference   for

amalgamation of unions within each category.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 specifically makes it difficult for

the   re-registration  of  smaller   unions,   and

prevents  the  creation  of  splinter  and  yellow

unions.   Together   with  clause   7,   and   the

amalgamation  clauses,  it  will  be  possible  to

effect  amalgamation within the several unions  in

each category. And we hope that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



the  not  too distant future we will have only  19

unions  representing all the workers in Singapore.

This,  I  am sure, will make it possible  for  the

prevention of rivalry between unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many unions made representations to the

Rendel Constitution Commission on the position  of

trade  unions in our country, and the question  of

permitting trade unions to set up political funds.

I  was  a member of the delegation, together  with

the  present Minister for Labour and Law  and  the

present  Minister for Finance, which  presented  a

case  for a trade union political fund. Though  we

tried to show that trade unions all over the world

had  the  right to set up political funds and  use

such  funds  in  the interest of  the  workers  in

promoting  legislation, and publishing  literature

of a political nature, we were not successful with

our  case.  We are, therefore, happy to note  that

this Government has now made it possible to set up

political funds. When all this is done,  when  all

these  splinter and yellow unions have been  taken

off  the register, there will still be some unions

whose  constitution is so cunningly  devised  that

the  rank  and file can at no time, even  if  they

dislike  and disapprove of the leadership,  remove

their  leadership.  It  is,  I  think,  the   most

important thing in a trade union that the rank and

file  members should at all times have  the  right

and  the  means to change the leadership  whenever

that leadership is not working in the interest  of

the  members.  But there are unions  in  Singapore

whose  constitution does not provide  such  means.

Therefore,  in this Bill when mention is  made  of

the  growth of a democratic trade union  movement,

it simply means that the workers - the rank and file

members - should have adequate representation at all

levels. Unfortunately, Sir, the unions which  have

the  type  of constitution which I have  mentioned

are led by aliens, by men who are not citizens  of

this  country and who do not owe loyalty  to  this

country;  but  the  members of  these  unions  are

predominantly  citizens of our  country.  We  must

make  sure  that the trade union movement  at  all

times is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



in  the hands of our people, that it is led by the

people  of this country. Only then can we  have  a

trade  union  movement that is  conscious  of  the

interests of the people of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill said that the

Government created a national union for Government

workers   and   he   mentioned  specifically   the

Amalgamated Union of Public Employees. I  want  to

make it clear, Sir, that Government did not create

this   Union.  This  Union  was  created  by   the

amalgamation at the first stage of two unions  and

at  a subsequent stage 10 other unions amalgamated

and  created  the A.U.P.E. There  were  39  unions

serving  Government  and City Council  workers  in

September  1959.  Today, Sir, there  are  only  25

unions   on  the  register,  together   with   the

Amalgamated Union of Public Employees, which  goes

to  show  that  a  large  number  of  unions  have

amalgamated  one  way  or another  to  create  the

Amalgamated Union of Public Employees. Today,  the

membership of this Union is over 8,000. The  total

membership   of  those  unions  which   have   not

amalgamated  does  not reach 8,000.  How  can  the

Member for Cairnhill say that A.U.P.E. has failed?

That  this  Union, supposedly created, as  he  has

claimed, by Government, has failed when it  has  a

total membership exceeding the total membership of

the other unions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say something more in

connection  with the Amalgamated Union  of  Public

Employees.  This Union has claimed recognition  on

behalf  of  three groups of workers in  Government

and  the  City  Council, and it is the  Government

with  whom we are negotiating for recognition.  We

have   not   yet   succeeded   in   getting   that

recognition.   If  this  Union  was   created   by

Government, then it would be the easiest thing for

Government to grant recognition to all  grades  of

Government and City Council workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill and the Member for the

Southern  Islands  touched upon  May  Day.  I  can

understand   the  feelings  of  the   Member   for

Cairnhill,  Sir.  May Day 1960 will  stay  in  the

memory of all workers - maybe it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



stay  in  the memory of Members of the  Opposition

too - because  never in the history of  our  country

did so many workers, as one newspaper put it, over

50,000  workers,  attended a May Day  rally.  This

rally  was organised after the T.U.C. Constitution

was adopted at the delegates' conference and after

the  officials  of  the  T.U.C. were  elected - not

before, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had known and I am sure if the officials of

the   T.U.C. had  known,  that  Members  of   the

Opposition  were  so much interested  in  May  Day

rallies,  then we would have made it possible  for

them  to attend and thereby experience the spirit,

the  sense of loyalty, the sense of unity that was

displayed at the rally. We might think about it in

any  case  for  the next rally. Sir,  over  50,000

workers have endorsed the T.U.C. Constitution  and

have  given  support  to  the  new  officials.  It

happens that some of the officials are members  of

the   People's  Action  Party.  If  the  Singapore

People's  Alliance  had trade unionists  who  were

honest, dedicated and hard-working I am sure  that

today  in the T.U.C. we might have found  some  of

them. But, unfortunately, they did not produce any

man of that calibre. If it is the P.A.P. which has

the  trade union leaders, and if it is the  P.A.P.

trade  unionists who have the overwhelming support

of  the  workers,  it is not  the  fault  of  this

Government at all. Leaders are elected as  to  how

the workers want it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for the Southern Islands touched

upon compulsory membership of unions. I would like

to  state here that we must correct the old  state

of  affairs where 100 workers became members of  a

union and 300 workers remained outside and yet  at

the same time enjoyed the benefits of what the 100

workers  had fought for and never had to  shoulder

their   responsibility.  The  trade  unions   must

correct  that state of affairs. But membership  of

trade unions will not be compulsory. But I am sure

the  trade  unions will make use of the Industrial

Relations   Ordinance  whereby   awards   by   the

Industrial Arbitration Court will be made only  to

members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



the  unions.  I  am sure that if negotiations  are

concluded along those lines, then workers who  are

now  not  member of trade unions and who  see  the

benefits which will accrue to them if they  become

members  of  trade unions will no doubt  join  the

trade  unions. But it will be wrong  to  say  that

anyone  in the trade union movement will compel  a

member  or worker to become a member of the  trade

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Relations Ordinance has

imposed  certain  responsibilities  on  the  trade

union  movement. It takes the trade union movement

and   employer  away  from  the  situation   which

prevailed  many years ago and brings them  to  the

point  where  collective  bargaining,  negotation,

conciliation, or arbitration, should be  the  mode

of  the day. If the unions' aspirations are to  be

met  successfully, then the unions must  be  in  a

position  to be able to present facts and  figures

to  the  Industrial Arbitration Court and, on  the

basis  of sound reasoning, to get fair awards.  In

order to do this, it will not be possible for  any

single  union to organise, for instance,  research

facilities  in  Singapore  to  organise   workers'

education  in  order to educate  the  workers,  to

understand    the   arbitration   machinery,    to

understand  the  conciliation  machinery,  or   to

understand collective bargaining. This, therefore,

will  have  to be the responsibility of  a  Trades

Union  Congress. If the Trades Union  Congress  is

weak, if it is just one out of many unions, if  it

has  only about 30 unions out of 100 unions,  then

it  will  not  have  the  means  to  provide  such

facilities,  nor will it be able  to  present,  on

behalf of labour, any cohesive policy at all.  But

industrial  peace with justice, if it is  to  have

meaning  and hopes of realisation, it is necessary

that   there  should  be  a  certain   amount   of

discipline  within  the movement.  The  discipline

should  be  a discipline within the movement.  The

discipline  should  not be a  discipline  that  is

imposed  but  it  should be a discipline  that  is

created  within the movement and accepted  by  all

unions  and workers alike. This is very  important

if  industrial  stability is to be maintained.  We

hope,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



Sir,   that   the  new  T.U.C.,   with   its   new

constitution  and  with this Bill  that  makes  it

possible  for  all  unions to affiliate  with  the

T.U.C.,   will   have   the  resources   and   the

organisation not only to perform the  services  so

essential but also to maintain discipline that  is

so  essential for our country and the  economy  of

this country. Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br>6.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I would

have  thought  that this Bill was to  bring  about

unity  among  the trade unions. We  also  consider

this  a very desirable objective. But, Sir,  there

are  two other questions which worry the minds  of

other  unions in Singapore. One is this,  Sir. In

which direction is this united organisation going?

For   which   destination  is  it  heading?   Sir,

naturally,  it is more economical to use  one  bus

instead  of 20 buses. But, if one bus is going  to

Pasir  Panjang and another bus goes to Katong  and

the  passengers are not given the right to  choose

the bus and they are all asked to get into the bus

for Pasir Panjang -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Helicopter!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - the Minister for Labour and

Law  may  not  like it, because  he  wants  to  go

somewhere else in another direction. So there  are

workers  who  begin to wonder after  the  May  Day

rally  speeches  whether  they  are  going  to  be

compelled to join a union which they do not  like,

because   the  union  is  heading  in  the   wrong

direction. Under this Bill, will they be compelled

willy-nilly to hop into the bus that takes them to

the wrong destination, at least in their eyes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, in a democratic country we

should  try  to persuade and encourage  people  to

unite,  but we should never force them  to  unite.

If,  by chance, because of disagreement as to  the

destination workers in the same occupation want to

go  into  two different buses, I think it is  only

proper that they should be allowed to go into  two

different buses until they decide on going in  the

same  direction  or towards the same  destination.

But  to compel all workers to go into the same bus

heading for the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



direction  or  destination, just because  one  old

lord says it must be done, is not democratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing some workers feel that they do not

want   to  become  trade  union  members  at  this

particular  juncture, will they be  penalised?  In

the  May  Day rally, speeches were made indicating

that every worker must be unionised; otherwise, he

might  be  wiped  out. In regard to  a  particular

union, the second question arises. Will this union

be compelled to join one particular association of

trade unions? Sir, under clause 59 of this Bill, I

see  it  is  quite possible for the Government  to

approve more than one association of trade unions.

But  in  practice,  will  the  Minister  give   an

assurance  that  it will be done,  or  is  it  the

intention  to  give a monopoly to  one  particular

association of trade unions? What happened  a  few

weeks ago, Sir, the creation of the ten tall  men

in trade union circles has caused some misgivings,

because  if  it is the intention to be democratic,

then surely before the ten tall men are elected or

appointed, others should be given a chance to come

in.  Then they can elect the ten tall men. But now

the ten tall men have been elected for five years.

If  there is going to be one association of  trade

unions,  with  all the top men already  appointed,

what  inducement is there for others who  are  not

already in the bus to come in?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They missed it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, several trade unions

have  sent  in  representations  complaining  that

although  they have got a membership of more  than

250  (one  has  got a membership of  over  1,500),

their  registration has been cancelled or has  not

yet  been approved. Sir, I would like to  ask  the

Minister  for Labour and Law - I hope  he  will

forgive   me   for   asking   questions   like   a

student - whether  the  principles  of   this   Bill

contravene  certain  human rights  listed  in  the

United  Nations  Universal  Declaration  of  Human

Rights. If these are the fundamental human rights,

I  am  sure  this Government, which is  now  self-governing,  should  respect  these  rights.  Under

Article  20  (1),  "every one  has  the  right  of

freedom, of peaceful assembly and association."  I

take it that one has got



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



the right to join any union that he likes. "(2) No

one may be compelled to belong to an association."

And  Article 23 (4) says, "Every one has the right

to   form  and  to  join  trade  unions  for   the

protection of his interests." If he feels that his

interests  are not being protected by a particular

trade  union  and he wants to join  another  trade

union or another association of trade unions, does

this Bill say that he cannot do that?

<br><br>6.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am of the opinion

that  very  little that was said by the Opposition

side  really  requires  any  answer  at  all.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has quite a

long record of activity in trade unionism. He  has

claimed to have made a study of this Bill. He  has

told  this House, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this Bill

is  founded on the present Trade Unions  Ordinance

as  well  as the Trade Unions Ordinance, 1959,  of

the Federation of Malaya. He has indicated to this

House that this Bill departs only in two ways from

the   present  law  and  from  the  law   of   the

Federation.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  not   my

function  to  educate him in trade union  matters.

But  I would draw his attention to the Comparative

Table which has been published together with  this

Bill. He will find there that this Bill departs in

17  ways  from the present Trade Unions  Ordinance

and  from the Trade Unions Ordinance, 1959, of the

Federation  of Malaya. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  he  has

stated  that  the membership of the executive  and

the  officers of trade unions should be restricted

to Singapore citizens. Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, he -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Could I suggest to the

Committee,  as  there is a definite  amendment  on

that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will deal with

this  point in Committee. The Member for Cairnhill

has  also  dealt with clause 59 of the  Bill,  and

that matter could also be dealt with in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause it stand part of

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  touch on paragraph (c) of sub-clause  (1)  of

this  particular clause. Sir, under this  clause,

before  a trade union can be registered, it  must

comply  with  certain facts in order  to  satisfy

the  Registrar. Paragraph (c) says that  a  trade

union must, first of all, be affiliated with  the

T.U.C.  I  said during the debate on  the  Second

Reading  of  this Bill that while it  is  a  good

thing that trade unions should be asked -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the clause

itself specifically says that a trade union  must

be  affiliated  with  the  T.U.C.  Paragraph  (c)

reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...is affiliated to an association of trade

unions exempted by the Minister...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir, but it has been

pointed out by the Minister in his speech  as  to

what   it  means.  If  we  leave  it  at  "... an

association  of  trade  unions  exempted  by  the

Minister ...", it means that a trade union must

seek  affiliation with the T.U.C. even before  it

is  registered. It has to become an affiliate  of

the T.U.C. before qualifying for registration.  I

think  it should not be so. If it is the genuine

desire of the Government to promote a unified and

a united trade union movement, so long as a trade

union  qualifies  to  be  registered  under   the

various  paragraphs of sub-clause  (1)  and  that

union  must  seek affiliation with an association

of trade unions exempted by the Minister, then it

should  be  incumbent  upon that  association  of

trade  unions  to  approve  the  application  for

registration of that trade union. That should  be

the right way to go about it. Otherwise, it would

mean that the administration of the Department of

the  Registrar of Trade Unions is dependent  upon

the  whims  and  fancies of the  leaders  of  the

association  of  trade  unions  exempted  by  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge upon the Minister that it would be

more  desirable and less reprehensible if  it  is

laid down that so long as a trade union qualifies

to  be  registered  by  the Registrar  under  the

provisions  of all the other paragraphs  of  sub-clause  (1), the first step to be taken  by  that

union on registration is to seek affiliation with

the  T.U.C. and then the; association  of  trade

unions exempted by the Minister must approve  the

affiliation.  Otherwise, the work of  registering

that  union  is  just left in the  hands  of  the

association  of  trade  unions  exempted  by  the

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have had

considerable  experience of what went  on  before

and  we are determined to see that that situation

is  not  reproduced in the future. We  say  right

here  and now regarding the proposal in the  Bill

that  a  trade  union  will  first  have  to   be

affiliated  to  the association of  trade  unions

exempted under the provisions of clause 59 before

it  ever appears on the register, that this  what

we want.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



We cannot accept the position that a union should

be   registered   first  if  it   qualifies   for

registration  and then it is to seek affiliation.

That  accounted for all the industrial unrest  we

have had in the past. If the unions could do this

sort   of   thing,  we  would  get  the  position

developing again where the association  of  trade

unions  would just become one out of 225  unions.

We  will  never allow that situation  to  develop

again.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Minister

missed my point. Even before a trade union  could

be  considered for registration by the  Registrar

of  Trade  Unions,  it  would  have  to  get  the

blessing of the T.U.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Correct.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Even if the association of

trade  unions  exempted by the Minister  were  to

feel  that  the trade union seeking  registration

does  not contravene the other paragraphs of sub-

clause  (1), yet it could still say `No', because

it  happens  that the person or persons  who  are

organising  that  trade union do  not  happen  to

share  the same political beliefs as the  leaders

of  the present association of trade unions  that

will  be  exempted by the Minister.  It  is  more

proper that the Government should do its job.  It

should register a trade union if it feels that it

is  the right thing to do and not place all sorts

of obstacles before its registration is approved.

And  once registration is approved, it should  be

incumbent  upon this registered trade  union  and

upon the association of trade unions exempted  by

the   Minister  that  they  should  be  together,

instead  of  leaving the whole administration  of

the  registration  of a new trade  union  in  the

hands   of  the  association  of  trade   unions;

exempted by the Minister, unless, of course,  the

Minister is now going to say that the association

of trade unions to be exempted by the Minister is

going to be an organisation of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all these specious

reasons  are well known to us. We are quite  used

to all these antics



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in clause 59 - we do not even

mention the T.U.C. as you have pointed out - we only

state  that associations of trade unions can apply

for exemption from any or all of the provisions of

this  Bill.  We  leave  the trade  union  movement

absolutely  free, as a whole, to  form  their  own

association,  and  when they have  done  so,  they

apply  for exemption under clause 59. Their  rules

are looked into by the Minister, and if he has  no

objection  to these rules, then they are  exempted

from registration. Once this body is exempted from

registration,  it cannot change its rules  without

the   approval  of  the  Minister.  That  is   the

situation  we  want. We have set  up  the  various

categories  of  unions. We have  left  the  unions

completely   free.   Those  who   want   to   form

federations within these categories could do so if

they please. We say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if  we

fall  into the trap of agreeing to what the Member

for  Cairnhill  is now trying to suggest  to  this

House, we will be in exactly the same position  as

we were, and that is what we will never agree to.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I really fail to

understand what the Minister is trying to say.  He

says in this House that he has made no mention  of

the T.U.C. whatsoever and that any association of

trade   unions   can  apply  for  exemption   from

registration  under clause 59. But,  Sir,  it  was

only  on  May Day that the Minister said, "In  due

course,  every trade union must be affiliated  to

the T.U.C." Come, come! I hope the Minister is not

going to treat us like children to the extent that

we  do not know what the Minister has said outside

and inside this Assembly. He should be bold enough

to say, "This is the T.U.C. that I want. This is the organisation that I want to make use

of, because it is at present under the control  of

members of my Party." Why not come out boldly  and

say  it  blatantly? Do not treat us like children.

How can it ever be possible to say that if we were

to  take out paragraph (c) we would be coming back

to  the same position as before? If a trade  union

complies  with  all  the  provisions  set  out  in

paragraphs (a) to (f), it com-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



plies with all that the Government requires. Where

then  is the trap? We take exception only when  it

is   said,   "It  must  be  affiliated  with   the

association  of  trade  unions  exempted  by  the

Minister first." I suggest, Sir, that when a trade

union is registered, then that is the time to seek

affiliation,   and  that  even   when   it   seeks

affiliation the T.U.C. must, under its rules to be

approved   by   the  Minister, allow   for   its

application   for  affiliation.  It  has   already

happened,  Sir. A registered trade  union  applied

for affiliation to the T.U.C. one month ago and no

approval has so far been given. Is the running of

the Department of the Registrar of Trade Union  to

be  left  in the hands of the T.U.C.,  or  is  the

Government now going to say that the T.U.C. is  a

branch of the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody has ever

said that the T.U.C. is a branch or an arm of  the

Government. All this is complete nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are realists. We know what

went  on before and we are determined to see  that

the  people who played this dirty game will never

be  allowed  to  play it again. We are  determined

that  before any trade union is registered in  our

Ministry it has a clean name, and it can get  that

clean  name  only  when it  is  affiliated  to  an

association of trade unions that is exempted  from

the  provisions of this Bill. Otherwise, what will

happen  is  this.  These unions  will  be  on  the

register  and they will seek affiliation.  And  if

they  cannot get affiliation, they will carry  on.

You  will then get a split leadership in the trade

union  movement.  That is the sort  of  thing  the

Member for Cairnhill delights in.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Surely, Sir, the Minister is

capable  enough  to  put  on  the  certificate  of

registration a condition that the trade union must

seek  affiliation  to  the  association  of  trade

unions  to  be exempted by the Minister  within  a

period  of  three  months. Or, shall  we  say,  an

approval could just be given in writing  to  that

effect  and  when the affiliation  actually  takes

place, then the certificate of registration may be

issued. Can it not be done in that way?

of  pains to cleanse the trade union movement  and

get  dirty  again. We say that a trade union  will

first have to seek affiliation to the association

of   trade  unions  that  is  exempted  under  the

provisions  of this Bill, and that only  after  it

seeks  and gets the affiliation will it then  come

on to our register.

collect"  and insert "provide for the levying  or

collection of".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the words stand in the

clause, the provisions are unduly restrictive,

because the leadership of a trade union may get

into trouble for neglecting to levy or collect

subscriptions. Whenever any subscription is in

arrears, they would be offending against that

provision. For that reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have got to make this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

draw   the  attention  of  the  Minister  to  sub-

paragraph (ix) of paragraph (b) of this clause, at

page 8 of the Bill. This sub-paragraph means, Sir,

that   if   any  trade  union,  which  is  already

affiliated  to  an  association  of  trade  unions

exempted  by the Minister, is suspended or  kicked

out  by this association, then ipso facto it shall

lose its registration. I would not like to go  all

ever  the  ground again, but as I have  said  just

now,  I would urge upon the Minister to see to  it

that  the rules of the association of trade unions

that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



to be exempted by him should be quite stringent in

so far as the expulsion of an affiliated member is

concerned. It should not be so easy and  free  for

this  association to say, "I do not happen to like

your face; I do not happen to like the way you  do

things. It is not a question of principles, it  is

a  question of personal dislikes. Out you go,  and

you are no longer a registered trade union." I  am

sure the Minister would like to give his assurance

that   in   going  through  the  rules   of   this

association before he exempts it, he will  see  to

it  that the rules are stringent enough in so  far

as  the  expulsion  of the affiliated  members  is

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to seek clarification from the Minister as to what

the  proviso at page 12 of the Bill means.  It  is

clearly  stated,  Sir, at the  beginning  of  the

clause  at  page 11, that only a person under  the

age  of 21 years but above the age of 16 years can

become  a  member of a trade union.  And  yet  the

proviso  says, "unless provision be  made  in  the

rules thereof to the contrary". Does it mean  that

in  some  unions membership may be open to  people

under 16 years?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I call upon the Minister,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed by the Minister does not

go   far  enough  to  the  point  where  I   had

originally tabled my amendment. I feel  that  not

only  the officers of a trade union but also  the

members  of  the executive should be  limited  to

citizens of Singapore only. The amendment of the

Minister says that any person, before he  can  be

an  officer  of a trade union, must either  be  a

citizen  of  Singapore or a person  born  in  the

Federation of Malaya. I have said just  now  that

if  it  is really the intention of Government  to

see  that  only citizens of Singapore  are  given

every opportunity to help in the welfare of  this

country, surely it is important that in the trade

union  movement officials and members of a  trade

union  should be citizens of Singapore. Later  on

at this sitting, or maybe at the next sitting, we

will   be  debating  the  Singapore  Citizenship

(Amendment)   Bill  whereby  the  Government   is

proposing to make it more difficult for a  person

to  become a citizen of this State. Therefore,  I

say  to the Government: if we really want to  see

to  it  that  we  give  a  meaning  to  Singapore

citizenship,  let  us  confine  the  members  and

officers  of  the executive of a trade  union  to

citizens of Singapore only.

<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have always been

accused  of being undemocratic in all the  things

we  do. The Member for Tanglin has said just  now

that  there are some workers who want to go about

their business in 20 different buses and that  we

want  to  put everybody into one bus. The  Member

for Cairnhill has said that we are trying to turn

the  T.U.C. into another arm of the  P.A.P.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in the case here, we  have  shown

that we are liberal-minded, but nevertheless,  we

are  still  accused. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we  have

repeatedly  shown  in  this  House  that  we  are

realists. We look at the situation as we know  it

today. Who are in the trade union movement? There

are  people  who  are aliens. As  my  friend  and

colleague,  the  Member for  Kampong  Kapor,  has

said, there are many people who are aliens in the

trade union movement. They may be aliens - some  of

them  do  not  owe any loyalty to the country - but

they  are  nevertheless in the movement.  Now  we

have  been very rational in our approach to  this

problem.  We  make  a  distinction  between   the

officers   of   the  union  and   the   executive

committee. We say that it is very necessary  that

people  with  their roots in this country  should

qualify to become officers in any trade union.  A

person  who is born in the Federation  of  Malaya

may   not   be   a  citizen  of  Singapore,   but

nevertheless  he  has his roots  firmly  in  this

country. We say that he should qualify to  be  an

officer in a trade union equally with the citizen

of  Singapore. We have given a definition to  the

term  "officer". It means the main  officials  of

any executive committee, such as the president or

chairman,  the  vice-president or  vice-chairman,

the   treasurer,  the  secretary,  the  assistant

treasurer,  the  assistant  secretary,  the  paid

officials  in  those  categories  such  as   paid

secretaries   or   assistant  secretaries,   paid

treasurers or assistant treasurers. Those are the

people who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



qualify  to  be  officers. Now  in  the  executive

committee  itself, there might be people  who  are

aliens  who  are  not citizens of Singapore.  They

could serve on the executive committee. We are not

unreasonable and say, "Get out of it now. We  want

everybody  who is a citizen to be on the executive

committee  of  the  union." That  is  being  very

unfair.  We desire the same thing that the  Member

for  Cairnhill  desires. We want to  arrive  at  a

position where every member of the executive is  a

citizen  of Singapore. But we approach the problem

in a practical way. We do it step by step. When we

want to do things step by step, we are accused  of

being   undemocratic.  The  whole  thing   becomes

complete nonsense when you argue on that basis.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, when the new citizenship

law  came into force in 1957, 327,000 people became

citizens of Singapore. People who are born  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya  could  become  citizens  of

Singapore   with  just  a  period  of  two   years'

residence   here.  People  who  are  born   outside

Commonwealth countries will have to have  a  longer

residential  qualification. But most of  them  have

already  become  citizens of Singapore.  Those  who

have  not become Singapore citizens are only a very

few.  They  have  not  `become  Singapore  citizens

because  they do not wish to, or because they  have

not  got  their residential qualification to  apply

for citizenship. Surely, Sir, if we really want  to

give  a  meaning  to Singapore citizenship,  if  we

really  want to see to it that the running of  this

country  is  left in the hands of  people  who  are

citizens of Singapore, then let us face facts.  Let

us  say - it should be so - that before you can become

an  officer or a member of the executive of a trade

union, you must be a citizen of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that it is open to people who are

born  in  the  Federation who have not  yet  become

citizens  of Singapore would make one come  to  the

conclusion that because some of the ten tall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



men in the T.U.C. are not yet citizens of

Singapore, this provision in the Bill is therefore

made just for them and for the Government of the

day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I have just heard a

submission from an irresponsible person that Bills

are  drafted  to  fit in with  the  desires  of  a

political party We are responsible people here. We

are trying to do the right thing by the people  of

Singapore. And I have heard it said just now  that

what  we  are  trying  to do is  being  done  with

ulterior  motives, Sir. We are not concerned  here

with  ten  tall  men.  We are concerned  with  the

merits of this Bill, and the merits of what we are

trying  to  do.  I  think it is quite  unfair  and

improper   for   anybody  without   any   evidence

whatsoever to cast doubts on our motives.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has called me irresponsible and unfair and that I

have  no evidence. If the Minister would be  good

enough  to  say  that the ten tall  men  are  all

citizens of Singapore, I stand corrected,  and  I

will extend my sincerest apologies to him.

reference  be made to paragraph (b) of  subsection

(1)  of  section  11?  That  particular  paragraph

refers  to  a  trade  union of employees.  It  has

nothing  to do with a trade union of employers  at

all. So why say that this trade union of employers

should  not be affected by a paragraph that refers

to  a  trade  union  of employees?  It  is  making

confusion and I am confounded.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This amendment, Sir, is

proposed  to  make  it easy for  trade  unions  of

employers,  so  that  they will  not  have  to  go

through  the  process  of  re-registering.  It  is

difficult to insist that officers of a trade union

of  employers  should be citizens of Singapore  or

persons  born in the Federation. That I  agree.  I

agree to this amendment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



but  I give notice that I will be speaking on  the

other two parts of this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 30, as amended,

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have given notice that I

will  speak  against paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of

clause 30.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 and 29 lay down very clearly that a

person should not be a member of a trade union  if

he  is  this, that and the other. And there  is  a

proviso  in clause 29 giving power to the Minister

to allow a person to become an employee of a trade

union.  After having laid down in black and  white

certain conditions which must be observed before a

person can become an officer of a trade union, or

a  member  of the executive, or an employee  of  a

trade  union,  why should the Minister  now  want

power to say that, if it is found that there is  a

man who is good enough to be an officer of a trade

union  even  though he may not  be  a  citizen  of

Singapore, even though he may not be born  in  the

Federation of Malaya, he can become an officer  of

a trade union. This takes it far afield. There is

no  restriction. It is left to the Minister to say

"Yes,  you can, because I think you are quite  all

right."



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have proved my

point,  but  after a waste of a lot of  time.  The

Opposition Member never took the trouble to  read

the  Bill.  If he had, he would have  found  that

this  clause  has been taken from  the  Federation

Ordinance. There are occasions, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

where  the  Minister can make  an  order  granting

exceptions from the provisions of clauses  28  and

29.  Under the provisions of this clause, all that

it seeks to do is this.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite possible for instance for the case

of  an  employee  who  has  been  convicted  of  a

criminal   offence   to  be  considered   by   the

Registrar. The Registrar might say that he  should

not  be  employed  because  of  his  previous  bad

record.  He  has  power under  the  provisions  of

clause  29  to appeal to the Minister.  But  over-riding  all that, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this  power

of  exemption that is given in clause  30  to  the

Minister,   and   that  is  identical   with   the

provisions of the Federation Ordinance, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when it

suits  the Minister he makes reference to the  law

of  the Federation, but when it does not suit him,

he   does  not  do  so.  In  the  Federation,  the

restriction  is to citizens of the  Federation  of

Malaya. It is not as what we have in clause 28.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 39 stand part of

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I seek clarification from

the Minister. Two or three registered trade unions

can  amalgamate  and become an  amalgamated  trade

union,  and  these two or three trade  unions  can

still function as autonomous trade unions. That is

how  I  read it. The amalgamated union, formed  by

the amalgamation of these two or three undissolved

trade unions, will have to seek registration as  a

trade union. That is in the last two sentences  of

sub-clause  (4) of this clause. That  is  to  say,

before   this  amalgamated  trade  union  can   be

registered, it has to affiliate to the association

of trade unions to be exempted





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



by  the Minister. If such a state of affairs is to

arise,  does it not mean duplication?  The  member

unions  of  this  amalgamated  union  are  already

affiliates  of  the T.U.C., and because  they  are

amalgamated,  they are a second affiliate  of  the

T.U.C.  How much money have they to pay? How  much

voting  are they allowed? Would it not mean  that,

for  the  purpose of registration, it is  a  trade

union, and therefore as a trade union under clause

11, it has to be affiliated to the T.U.C.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all this is being

done  deliberately  to  waste  as  much  time   as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Minister

should   take  that  attitude.  That  is   perhaps

alleging an improper motive. Let us deal with this

calmly and quietly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the intention of

this  clause  is  quite clear.  Any  two  or  more

registered  trade  unions can  amalgamate  as  one

trade  union. The word is "one" trade union.  When

the  trade unions decide to amalgamate, they  will

form one trade union, and the next move is to  get

affiliated -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No. It is not so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - to the association that is exempted

under the provisions of clause 59. Then they  come

on to the register. What is the difficulty?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am afraid I do not

understand,  Sir. These two unions can  amalgamate

even  without  dissolution.  Therefore,  the   two

unions still exist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

provisions  in this Bill dealing with amalgamation

and  there are provisions dealing with federation.

In  Part  VIII  of the Bill you  will  see  how  a

federation  is formed. In clause 39 you  will  see

how  an  amalgamation is formed.  When  the  trade

unions amalgamate, Mr Speaker, Sir, they cease to

be  separate unions. They are separate  components

before  they are amalgamated. But once  they  have

amalgamated,  they  become one  trade  union.  The

position is quite unlike that of a federation.  If

the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



Cairnhill  will only take the trouble to  look  at

paragraph 3 (o) of the Fifth Schedule in page  41,

that  clearly  shows  what a  federation  is.  The

components  of  a federation keep  their  separate

identities.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if the Hon. Minister will

take the trouble to look at line 8 on page 18,  he

will  not  have to make such a lengthy  speech  in

reply  to  the  simple question 1 asked.  On  this

particular line it is said that two or more unions

can  amalgamate without dissolution. If the unions

are  not dissolved, therefore the unions are still

there. Is that not so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Member

for  Cairnhill jumped to the conclusion that I was

quite  wrong when I referred to clause 11 (1)  (b)

and  he said that it only refers to employees  and

there  is no mention of employers in it.  When  he

took  a  second look, he saw how right I was.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, here also he has jumped to the wrong

conclusion.  The words used here are that  two  or

more  unions can amalgamate and become  one  trade

union  with or without dissolution or division  of

the  funds  of  such trade unions.  That  is  very

clear, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

surely the two things are separate - with or without

dissolution of the unions and the division of the

funds   of  the  unions.  What  the  Minister   is

attempting  to  do  is  to  read  "dissolution  or

division  of  the  funds"  as  one,  which   makes

complete nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very clear.

The  words  used are, "Any two or more  registered

trade  unions within one of the categories .  .  .

may  become  amalgamated as one trade  union".  If

they  are  amalgamated as one  trade  union,  they

cannot  keep  their own identities. How  can  they

keep  their  own identities? How do  you  get  one

trade  union if there are in fact two?  It  is  as

simple  as all that, Mr Speaker. "With or without

dissolution or division" relates to the  funds  of

the  unions  and  not  to the  identities  of  the

unions, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the only course I can suggest to

the Minister, if he is going to dissolve the

funds, is to put it in nitric acid or burn it up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If that is what you want, you can

have it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

executive  and officers of the federation  and  of

every member of a committee provision for which is

made in the rules of the federation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment is similar to

the amendment that I have already moved to clause

10 (2) (d) on page 5, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 54, as amended, ordered to stand part of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is necessary, Mr Speaker, Sir,

because of the Mutual Benefit Organisations Bill,

which will soon be enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 58, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 59-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 59 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I find that

under  this  clause the Minister  may  exempt  any

association of trade unions from any or all of the

provisions  of the Bill, but I do not  find  there

any  power  to  withdraw the exemption.  In  other

words, once you have exempted an association,  the

exemption  holds good till eternity, unless  there

is amending legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in sub-clause (3) of this particular

clause, it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any trade union or federation of trade unions

may by resolution of its executive affiliate...".



<br><br>Why  not come out with the truth that trade unions

must  affiliate? There is no more discretion  left

to  a  trade  union or federation of trade  unions

whether   or  not  to  affiliate.  They  have   to

affiliate.  So  why say "may" and  make  it  sound

better? They must and they have to affiliate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I do not propose to go over the

ground I have already covered. Mr Speaker, Sir. I

only  wish  to  point out that the association  of

trade unions must first apply to the Minister  for

exemption   from  registration.   After   he   has

considered  the rules and is satisfied with  them,

he  grants  the exemption under the provisions  of

this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in sub-clause (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An association of trade unions which is

exempted by the Minister under subsection (1) ...

shall not change its rules without the written

permission of the Minister"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With due respect, Sir, I think the

Minister  has not answered the question raised  by

the Member for Cairnhill whether, in the event  of

the  Minister  having exempted an  association  of

trade  unions and he subsequently feels that  they

are not doing the right thing either by him or  by

the country, its registration should be withdrawn.

The question is whether under the Bill that can be

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question which I myself would like to

ask  is whether the Minister would grant exemption

if  there were more than one association of  trade

unions seeking exemption under sub-clause (2)?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is by

implication that if an association of trade unions

changes  its rules without the permission  of  the

Minister,  it is no longer exempted. The exemption

is subject to those conditions. It ceases to be an

exempted association of trade unions if it changes

its rules without permission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, Sir, I would say quite

firmly here that it is the intention of Government

to  exempt  only one association of  trade  unions

from registration.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

is  saying  that he has no power to  withdraw  the

exemption  so  long  as the association  of  trade

unions  does  not  amend  its  rules  without  his

sanction. This is a rather dangerous exemption. If

exemption  is  given  to an association  of  trade

unions  and  future  events  prove  that  such  an

association is not working in the interest of  the

country  as  a  whole, surely the Minister  should

have  the power to withdraw that exemption. If  he

has  no  such  power, then we will be having  this

Frankenstein in our midst.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have considered

all   this   ad   nauseam.  In   the   Federation,

associations of trade unions are registered  under

the Societies Ordinance. Under our present law, we

require  associations of trade unions to  register

under the Trade Unions Ordinance. In this case, we

do not require any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



registration.   We  exempt  on   application   for

exemption.  The  exemption is granted  on  certain

conditions,  but the associations of trade  unions

cannot change its rules without the permission  of

the Minister. If it breaches those conditions,  it

is no longer exempted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 59 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 60 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 61-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 61 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, under clause 61, there is

no  mention made of gazetting any formation  of  a

federation  of trade unions. Surely the  formation

of  a  federation of trade unions is an  important

event and the workers of Singapore should be  made

aware of the registration of such a federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my Second

Reading speech on this Bill, I pointed out to this

Assembly that a federation of trade unions is  not

a  trade union for the purposes of this Bill.  The

trade   unions  will  be  registered   and   their

registration gazetted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
