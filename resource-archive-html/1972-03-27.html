<div align="center"><b>CENTRE PROJECT (CEPTA TV)</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Functions and financial commitments)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Culture what percentage of the total expenses  of

the  Adult  Education TV Production and  Training

Centre   Project   does  his   Ministry's   share

represent;  what  kind  of  programmes  will   be

produced, for what audience and where;  and  what

kind of personnel will be trained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is not possible at this  initial

stage  to  say precisely what percentage  of  the

total   expenses  of  the  Adult   Education   TV

Production and Training Centre Project (known  as

CEPTA TV) my Ministry's share represents. This is

because the project will take three to four years

before it becomes fully operational.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, an idea can be gauged from its

financial commitment which is as follows :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Government will provide suitable building

accommodation  for  CEPTA TV  to  house  offices,

equipment, service and other technical areas. The

building is estimated to cost in the region of $1

million;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Government will also provide 50 per cent of

the  annually recurrent operating costs  of  CEPTA

TV, subject to a maximum of $900,000 per year;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Friedrich Ebert Stiftung of the

Federal  Republic of Germany will supply equipment

and   supporting  facilities  estimated  at   $6.5

million for CEPTA TV's operation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The Stiftung will also pay 50 per cent of

the annually recurrent operating costs of CEPTA TV

up  to  $900,000, plus anything in excess  of  the

joint limit of $1.8 million.



The  amount  of $500,000 provided under  Head  51,

subhead  103, of the 1972-73 Development Estimates

is intended to meet the capital expenditure on the

first stage of the building construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEPTA TV's activities will be carried out on a

regional  basis and the Centre will produce  adult

education  programmes which  will  provide  useful

audio-visual support for national institutions  in

Asia  engaged in the promotion of adult  education

through  television and other audio-visual  means.

The  programmes will be produced in Singapore, for

use  not  only  in Singapore, but  also  in  other

countries  in  Asia  which  participate   in   the

project.  The  audiences, therefore,  will  be  in

Singapore   and   in  the  Asian  countries   that

participate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personnel who will be trained include

television  programmers,  engineers,   and   other

personnel  in  the  adult  education  field.   The

training   of  personnel  in  specific  areas   of

television  production  will  be  carried  Out  in

conjunction with the Centre's programme production

activities. Much of the training will be given  on

an on-the-job basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 78 -



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item 001 of subhead

101*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said in this Parliament a week ago

that all the roads in the eastern sector have been

made  up  under  the Local Government  Integration

Act,   except  the  roads  in  Kampong   Pachitan,

Lengkong  Tiga and Kampong Eunos. Kampong Pachitan

is  private property, and the land is let  out  to

the  residents who are now occupying it. The roads

there are mainly earth roads. When it rains,  they

become  impassable because the  mud  turns  soggy.

Therefore,  I  would like to request the  Minister

concerned   to  make  up  the  roads  to   kampong

standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Eunos is a reserve road. A community

centre  has been built by the residents themselves

at  the  cost  of $110,000, and it is operational.

But because the existing roads are not constructed

in  accordance  with the road reserve,  therefore,

Sir, I hope the authorities concerned can make  up

Kampong  Eunos road under section 19 of the  Local

Government   Integration   Act.   Otherwise    the

authorities  have  to divert the existing  Kampong

Eunos  road, in accordance with the reserve  road,

so  that  the  centre  area can  be  extended  and

development work there can be carried out early.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I refer to the kampong roads in

Alsagoff Estate in Kampong Kembangan constituency.

Only  certain roads in that estate have been  made

up  to kampong standards. A greater number has yet

to  be  made  up,  and up to now  they  are  still

nothing  but  earth roads. So when it  rains,  the

drain  becomes  clogged and overflows  on  to  the

roads,  making the roads muddy. Sir, I would  like

to know why these roads have not been made up when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



applications  have already been submitted  to  the

Urban and Rural Services Committee many years ago,

and  when can they be made up according to kampong

standards?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, applications for roads to be built have not

been  considered and applications to fill up  pot-holes  in the roads have not been entertained.  It

is   strange   but   true,  Sir,   that   although

applications  have been made to  the  U.R.S.C, to

repair  Jalan  Ladang, including roadside  drains,

the  sum  approved to repair the road is up  to  a

limit  of $700 only. Despite the fact that  repair

work  has commenced, the badly damaged roads  have

not  been repaired. Instead the other roads  which

only require minor repairs have been attended  to.

I  wish  to know how this state of affairs can  be

allowed  to  go  on, and whether  applications  to

metal  roads in Alsagoff Estate, Kampong  Ubi  and

Kampong  Kembangan constituencies can be  approved

this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first

of  all,  with  your permission, I would  like  to

range  my remarks over amendments* numbers (2)  to

(7)  under this Head, so that I need not  have  to

move them again.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendments, standing in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting, read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to he allocated for Head 78 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item 010 of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item 012 of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 78 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the total sum to be allocated for Head 78 be

reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, may I first congratulate the

Urban and Rural Services Committee, headed by  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Law

and  National  Development, for providing  various

amenities in the rural areas, such as making up of

kampong  roads,  water  and electricity  supplies,

street lighting, etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the apportionment of this fund

for     the    various    constituencies    varies

considerably. Though much has been  done  in  this

respect,  for  which  my constituents  and  I  are

indeed  grateful, Sir,  there is,  however,  still

plenty  of  room for improvement. For example,  in

the  Trafalgar Estate, which formerly  housed  the

Trafalgar  Receiving  Station,  there  are  a  few

hundred families, most of whom are farmers.  There

is  no  water  supply  there,  though  electricity

supplies are available presently. Also in Track 6,

off Punggol Road, the residents have requested for

water  supplies  for  a  long  time.  I  hope  the

Minister    concerned,   or   his    Parliamentary

Secretary, will favourably consider my requests in

this  respect. There are other requests  too,  for

example,  electricity supplies, but  I  would  not

like  to bother this House with details except  to

say that I hope such requests can be acceded to as

soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Public Utilities Board

has   been   implementing  rural   electrification

schemes  costing about $2.65 million per annum.  I

wonder  whether  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  is

actually    taking   steps   to    expedite    the

implementation of such schemes. I say this because

now  and again we receive progress reports of such

schemes being carried out, and it is noticed  that

in  some  of my areas implementation will  not  be

carried out until a year or two later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect that I wish to bring to the

attention  of  the  Minister concerned  is  street

lighting in the rural areas. First of all, most of

the  street lights that have been put up  are  not

bright enough, probably due to low



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



wattage, and they get out of order every  now  and

then.  In  this respect, I would urge the Minister

concerned   to   look  into  the  possibility   of

installing brighter and more durable lights.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect I would like to touch on is

the  state of agricultural and kampong roads. Many

agricultural   and   kampong   roads   have   been

constructed in the past few years, but I am afraid

that  by  now most of them are in urgent  need  of

repair.  Therefore, may I once again  request  the

Minister concerned to look into this matter. It is

gratifying  to note that this year's provision  is

$3.25  million.  It shows a marked  increase  over

last  year's provision. I hope that the Urban  and

Rural  Services Committee would be generous enough

to   entertain   the   requests   of   the   rural

constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not know whether or not it is proper for me to

raise one question. Sir, before an overhead bridge

is  erected, the Citizens' Consultative  Committee

or  the  Member of Parliament of that constituency

should  be consulted. There is one overhead bridge

in  my  constituency. It is near the Gan Eng  Seng

School. The children going to and from the  school

do  not use this overhead bridge because they have

to  cross  two  other roads where  there  is  more

traffic,  before  they can come to  this  overhead

bridge.  But  there  are no overhead  bridges  for

these  two other roads where the traffic  is  very

heavy. Therefore, the school children do not  wish

to  utilise the overhead bridge near their school.

I  do not know whether or not the other Members of

Parliament were consulted when an overhead  bridge

was  built  in their constituencies. But  in  this

case,  neither my Citizens' Consultative Committee

nor  myself  was  consulted. Last Sunday  I  drove

through my constituency -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr P. Govindaswamy, I am

afraid we have crossed the bridge many days ago!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, a lot of money is being

spent  on overhead bridges. Therefore they  should

be  fully  utilised  by the people.  We  would  be

spending money unnecessarily if nobody is going to

use   the  overhead  bridges.  Therefore,   proper

arrangements  should  be  made  to  see  that  the

overhead  bridge near the Gan Eng Seng  School  is

fully   utilised.   Will  the  Minister   or   his

Parliamentary Secretary look into this matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, approval was given last year to put up

lights  in  Palmer  Road,  which  is  also  in  my

constituency.  I  was promised that  it  would  be

completed last September. However, six months have

passed-and it is now March 1972- and yet no lights

have  been  put  up. I hope the  Minister  or  his

Parliamentary Secretary concerned will  look  into

this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  since the Member for  Punggol  has

been  allowed to range over his other  amendments,

one  of which stands in my name*, I wish to  speak now so that I need not move

my amendment later.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment, standing in the names of

Messrs Ho Kah Leong, Ng Kah Ting, Teong Eng Siong

and Sim Boon Woo, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)That the sum to be allocated for Head 78

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in full agreement with what the Member

for  Punggol  has  said. The provision  for  rural

services  is $3.25 million, and although  this  is

more  than last year's provision, it is still  not

sufficient.   If  this  provision   were   to   be

distributed  to  the various constituencies,  each

constituency will only get $10,000 or  less.  This

amount Xs not even enough to metal a road. I think

a  provision of two or three times more  than  the

present  provision  of  $3.25  million  should  he

allocated.  Since we are making rapid progress  in

our economic development, more provision should be

made  so that the living conditions of the  people

in the rural areas can be improved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter of fact, the

requests made by the people in the rural areas are

basically  very  simple. They want roads  properly

surfaced,  drains  to  flow smoothly,  and  public

utility  services  like  water,  electricity   and

street lighting. Water is their most urgent  need.

In  the last few years the Government has extended

the  water  mains  to the various  constituencies.

However, there are many areas, especially  in  the

more  remote parts, which still do not have  water

supply.  In  these areas, the people have  to  dig

wells  for their water. Whether or not these wells

are  hygienic  is  another matter.  In  any  case,

during  the dry spells the wells will dry  up  and

they  have to depend on Government delivery trucks

which give only a limited supply of water. This is

a  great  inconvenience to them. I know that  many

constituencies  have requested for water  supplies

but their applications have not been approved. The

authorities  concerned have  replied  that  it  is

uneconomic  to  extend the water  mains  to  these

remote  areas.  I  hope  they  will  not  be   too

calculating in the analysis of cost and profit.  I

hope the people in these more remote areas will be

provided with adequate water supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people in the rural areas

also want better roads. They would like to see all

the present mud tracks properly metalled with tar.

These  mud tracks, which are used by the villagers

every  day, are uneven, and they hold many puddles

of  water.  This is a great inconvenience  to  the

villagers. The mud tracks in the villages can only

last  for  a  short time. In the case of  laterite

tracks, after a year or two of use, there will  be

many  pot-holes which have to be repaired.  During

the  dry  season, the laterite tracks become  very

dusty, and when it rains they are very muddy. This

has  caused  a lot of hardship especially  to  the

primary school children, because their clean white

shoes  become dirty with red mud after walking  on

these  laterite  tracks. Moreover, these  laterite

tracks  are not durable. Every two or three  years

they have to be repaired.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



The  repair  will cost a few thousand dollars.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  know that it is  impossible  to

metal  all the tracks within six months or even  a

year.  But I would like to see a greater provision

made so that more laterite roads will be metalled.

However,  I  hope  that  the  provision  of   more

metalled  roads  will not mean a deterioration  in

the  quality  of the roads. In my constituency,  I

notice  that there are many metalled roads with  a

lot of pot-holes. As soon as one part of a road is

repaired, potholes appear in another part. In less

than  two  years the road seems like an old  shirt

with mendings everywhere. What is surprising to me

is that some of these roads have pot-holes in less

than  six months after their construction. I  have

taken  photographs showing the terrible  condition

of  these  roads,  and I have shown  them  to  the

Parliamentary Secretary. I am not an engineer and,

therefore,  I  am not familiar with the  technical

points involved in road construction. But the fact

that these roads are easily damaged shows that the

foundation  of the road is not strong. Why  cannot

the  relevant department first assess the  maximum

weight  the  road can support and  then  make  the

foundation  accordingly. If this is not  done,  as

soon as a road is constructed, repairs have to  be

carried  out every now and again. This will  be  a

waste of public funds. Moreover, some of these pot-holes   are  not  mended  in  time.  I  hope   the

Parliamentary Secretary will look into this matter

and  provide  better roads for the people  in  the

rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, people in the rural areas also

want  the drains to flow smoothly. When the drains

are  clogged  up,  they are not  only  a  breeding

ground  for mosquitoes, but they also give  out  a

terrible   stench.   This  is   very   unhygienic.

Moreover,  excessive water from the  silted  drain

will  erode  the surface of the road. I  hope  the

department  concerned  will  organise   teams   of

workmen  to clear the major drains in every  rural

constituency at least once a year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the rural areas also require

electricity supply. The Public Utilities Board has

said  that  it  will provide rural electrification

within  one  or two years. I hope the  Board  will

keep   its   word.  The  people   in   the   rural

constituencies  also want street lighting.  Street

lighting will make the road users feel much  safer

and  thus more conducive to the maintenance of law

and  order.  I  hope all the rural areas  will  be

provided with street lighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are not many rural constituencies

in  Singapore, their total areas are quite big. We

do need a greater provision for rural services.  I

hope  that  in  the next Budget the  Parliamentary

Secretary will request a bigger provision from the

Minister for Finance for the development of  these

rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I fully agree with my colleagues who

have   spoken   on   rural  services.   They   are

representatives  of  the  people  from  the  rural

areas.  This year a provision of $3.25 million  is

made   for  urban  and  rural  services,   and   I

appreciate that the Government has made  a  bigger

provision  than  for last year. However,  I  agree

with  the Member for Jurong when he said that this

increased  provision is still not  sufficient  for

many  of  the  projects in the  rural  areas.  For

example,  there is a very urgent need  to  provide

for  more  rural roads. Although many applications

have   been   made,  not  many  roads  have   been

constructed. The excuse given is that there is not

enough  provision. This shows that more  provision

is  needed  for the construction of roads  in  the

rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise two points. First, the

provision  for the construction of roads  is  only

$750,000.  It  seems to me that this  sum  is  too

small.  There  are many roads in  my  constituency

which  are yet to be constructed. Of course, there

are also other areas like Jurong, Punggol and Chua

Chu   Kang  (which  is  the  constituency  of  the

Minister of State for Finance), Nee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



Soon,  Changi, Bukit Panjang, Jalan Kayu, etc.  If

we  were  to distribute the provision among  these

various  constituencies, then  the  sum  for  each

constituency will be very small and it will not be

sufficient.  Since we have a surplus  budget  this

year, I think we can well afford to provide a  few

million dollars more for rural development.  So  I

would  ask  the  Minister  concerned  to  consider

increasing this provision.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to the supply of water,

which is a very important matter. In the past,  we

had many public standpipes. But the Government has

been encouraging people to install their own water-pipes  and there has been a decrease in the number

of   public  standpipes.  The  provision  of  $1.5

million  for  the  extension of  water  supply  is

insufficient  and  I hope that the  Minister  will

consider  increasing  this amount.  During  a  dry

spell,  perhaps the Minister of State for  Finance

may  remember, the Government had to  arrange  for

water  wagons and lorries to supply water  to  the

people   in   Chua  Chu  Kang  and   other   rural

constituencies.  But in Sembawang,  we  are  lucky

because  we can dig wells and the area is not  too

dry. So we are more fortunate. I hope the Minister

will  consider  increasing the provision  for  the

extension of water supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, last

year, under this subhead. I raised the question of

insufficiency of funds allocated to the Urban  and

Rural    Services   Committee   for   making    up

agricultural and kampong roads. For 1972-73, there

is  an  increase of $300,000, and I would like  to

thank   the   Minister  for   Law   and   National

Development for giving full consideration  to  our

plea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next financial year the provision for

item  013 - Jetties - has been reduced by $25,000.

I  believe that this meagre sum of $50,000 is  for

the  repair of jetties in the Southern  Islands  -

Pulau  Ubin. Pulau Tekong - and also other jetties

on our main island.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  Members representing the constituencies  such

as Jurong, Telok Blangah and Pasir Panjang have got

surrounding  islands  to look after.  Therefore,  I

think you will agree with me that $50,000 will  not

be  enough to repair the very bad condition of  the

jetty  at Pulau Ubin. Sir, this year, I would  like

to  plead  again  with  the  Minister  to  consider

increasing the provision for this item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  support  the   various

Parliament    representatives    of    the    rural

constituencies in regard to the provision of  rural

services.  I have two questions to raise  with  the

Minister.  The first question relates to drains  in

rural  constituencies. Up to this moment,  I  think

there is no comprehensive plan to construct a  good

drainage  system. In our Budget for 1972-73,  there

is  no provision for the construction of drains.  I

would  like to know whether Government is going  to

provide  a  special scheme for the construction  of

drains in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the supply of

electricity. In the last few years, the authorities

concerned have done very well in this respect.  Not

only  have  they spent their own time visiting  the

rural  areas,  but  they have  also  contacted  the

various  Members of Parliament in  order  to  do  a

better   job, and  I  would  like  to  thank   the

authorities  concerned  on this  matter.  But  some

Members  just now mentioned that there are  schemes

for  rural electrification which have not yet  been

carried  out.  I think this is not  a  question  of

inefficiency.  It  is  more a question  of  getting

enough  contractors to carry out  the  projects  so

that  the electrification of the rural areas  could

be carried out more efficiently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

reply to the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



for  Kampong  Kembangan  regarding  Kampong  Eunos,

there  is  no  plan at the moment to  make  up  the

stretch of road from Kampong Eunos to Jalan  Yasin,

as  the area is heavily squattered. Improvement  to

the  existing track may be considered if a  request

is  made  to the Urban and Rural Services Committee

by the Citizens' Consultative Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Alsagoff Estate, in fact, we have

carried  out  quite  a lot of improvements  in  the

Kampong  Kembangan, Kampong Ubi and  Geylang  Serai

areas.  For instance, we have extended Sims  Avenue

to  Jalan  Eunos,  and constructed  the  Pan-Island

Expressway from Paya Lebar Road to Jalan Eunos.  We

have  also widened and improved Jalan Ubi and Jalan

Eunos.  With the two new major roads and the  other

two  improved roads just mentioned, the improvement

in  the  street  lighting, drainage and  foot-paths

have contributed considerably to the convenience of

the  people living in the area. As Alsagoff  Estate

will  eventually  become a housing  and  industrial

estate, it is unwise at this stage to make  up  all

the  side tracks in the area as this will in course

of  time  be broken up, and it will be a  waste  of

public funds. However, if it is necessary to  carry

out minor repairs, we will always meet the requests

when they are received from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department has no immediate

plans  to  make  up the portion of Jalan  Ubi  from

Jalan  Lada  to  Airport Road,  as  this  would  be

affected by Housing Board development of this  area

which is still in the planning stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Punggol, the Public

Utilities  Board has taken action  to  improve  the

servicing  of  street lamps in public  and  kampong

roads,  and the quality of lamps used will also  be

improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Punggol, three water-main laying schemes

for  the  Trafalgar  Estate in  Punggol  have  been

approved  recently, and work will  commence  within

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



next three months. They are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Lorong Renjong from Lorong Buang Kok to

Trafalgar Estate. The cost is $21,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Tracks in Trafalgar Estate. The cost is

$55,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Tracks adjoining Trafalgar Estate. The cost

is $12,500. The total cost will be $88,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scheme for Track 6, Punggol Road, and

many  more  water-main laying schemes for  Punggol

and  for  areas in other constituencies have  been

approved  recently and work will  be  carried  out

soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the rural electrification schemes,

Sir,  this provision of $50,000 is for the  supply

of  electricity  by generators  to  the  off-shore

islands,  which cannot be reached  by  the  Public

Utilities Board's supply. Electrification  schemes

for  the  mainland are met from P.U.B, funds.  For

this  year, the provision is $2.6 million. It  was

unfortunate that the Electricity Department of the

P.U.B., due to factors beyond their control, could

not  implement  approved  electrification  schemes

within  the  time specified in the programme.  For

example,  last  year,  owing  to  the  floods   in

Calcutta, the factories under contract were unable

to   supply  overhead  materials.  The  floods  in

Malaysia  also  resulted in a shortage  of  wooden

poles. Nevertheless, even with these setbacks, the

P.U.B, carried  out  and  completed   35   rural

electrification schemes between April,  1971, and

22nd March, 1972, benefiting about 2,000 houses at

a  cost of $660,000 while 23 other schemes  as  at

22nd  March,  1972, benefiting  about  3,000  more

houses  and  costing  $1  million,  are  still  in

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, both the Members for Jurong and

Sembawang have asked for more money to be provided

for  the repair of agricultural and kampong roads.

In  fact,  Jurong constituency, for instance,  was

allocated  $77,000 for 1971-72,  but  $88,000  was

committed.   So   for  Jurong  constituency,   the

provision was over-committed by $11,000. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



provision for Sembawang constituency was  $15,000,

but  $66,000  was committed. Similarly,  Sembawang

constituency  was over-committed by $51,000.  Sir,

from  a  comparison of these figures, we have,  in

fact,    spent   more   money   in    the    rural

constituencies.  For 1972-73,  the  provision  for

roads and other services has been increased by one-third  over the previous year's provision. Whether

or  not  more funds will be provided in the coming

years  will  depend on the number of requests  for

services  and  the amounts involved. However,  the

Members  from  the  rural  constituencies  can  be

assured  that  if  there is  a  balance  of  funds

uncommitted in the other constituencies,  it  will

ultimately    be    utilised   for    the    rural

constituencies.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last 11 years about $10

million  out of a total expenditure of $37 million

was  spent  on improvement of roads in  the  rural

constituencies.   Most   of   these   roads   have

considerably  improved.  The  Government  has  the

immediate  task of extending piped-water  supplies

to  households in the rural areas. In the next few

years we will step up the laying of water-mains in

areas where the people are still dependent on well-water. In areas where the people are dependent  on

public   standpipes,  these  standpipes  will   be

removed when water-mains are laid. The areas which

need  water-mains are Bukit Panjang, Bukit  Timah,

Changi, Chua Chu Kang, Jalan Kayu, Jurong, Kampong

Chai  Chee, Nee Soon, Punggol, Tampines,  and,  of

course,  Sembawang.  It is  hoped  that  with  the

stepping up of this scheme, every household in the

outlying  areas would, in the next three  or  four

years, be able to enjoy piped-water facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Changi, there is no

proposal for the construction of new jetties.  The

provision  of  $50,000 for  this  year  should  be

sufficient   for  the  maintenance   of   existing

jetties.  However, if there is a need to construct

new  jetties, the U.R.S.C, will make a request  to

the Finance Ministry for more funds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank   the

Parliamentary  Secretary for  doing  his  part  in

looking after the people in the rural areas. As he

is  the  chairman of the Urban and Rural  Services

Committee,  I am sure he appreciates  the  various

requests made by the people in the rural areas.  I

hope  this year, as in past years, he will do  his

utmost  for the benefit of the people. I  am  sure

the people will thank him for this.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my question regarding the making up  of  the

road  in  Kampong Pachitan up to kampong  standard

has  not  been replied to. I do not deny that  the

construction  of  two roads under  the  Pan-Island

Expressway scheme and the extension of Sims Avenue

are good efforts. But what I am concerned with  is

the  small earth-roads in Alsagoff Estate. It will

not  be appropriate if the Parliamentary Secretary

should  say that it is not proper for the  Housing

and  Development Board to do these roads. If  they

were to wait for the Housing and Development Board

to  develop the area, it will not take place until

the  next  few  years, because the development  is

still  in the planning stage. Therefore,  are  the

residents in the affected areas forced to continue

to   face  the  problems  which  they  have   been

experiencing  all  this while, such  as  mosquito-breeding,   and  flooding  until  this   area   is

developed?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sr. I have not

yet   heard   any  reply  from  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  regarding the overhead bridge  and  the

street lights in Palmer Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, regarding the road in

Kampong  Pachitan, I am not aware of this request,

but  I  presume  the reason for not approving  the

request could be due to a lack of funds last year.

Perhaps I might just give a rough idea of how much

was  spent on Kampong Kembangan. Out of an  actual

provision of $12,000 for last year, we only  spent

$8,300.  The vote was under-spent by approximately

$4,000.  But the whole project may cost more  than

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



amount. However, I would suggest to the Member  to

resubmit  his  application  to  the  U.R.S.C, for

consideration next month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken note of the complaint raised by the

Member  for Anson. He has brought up the  question

of  overhead bridges and street lighting, which  I

will certainly look into.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the

allocation  of  $12,000 for Kampong Kembangan  was

just  a small sum compared to the amount allocated

for  Sembawang.  Therefore, I  hope  that  when  I

submit  the  application for  the  improvement  of

Kampong  Pachitan, the vote for Kampong  Kembangan

would be equal to, if not, at least half or three-quarters of last year's vote for Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, surely I cannot promise

to  allocate  more funds for Kampong Kembangan  or

any  other constituencies. Basically the principle

of  the allocation of funds is based on population

and  the size of the constituency. In any case the

decision   for  the  allocation  rests  with   the

Ministry of Finance. There is nothing much we  can

do  for  the Member for Kampong Kembangan in  this

respect.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, although

the assurance is not convincing enough to satisfy

me, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,250,000 for Head 78 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to

raise one small point. It appears to me that last

year nothing was spent on this item, and the

provision of $10,000 for 1971-72 has been revoted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



for the next financial year. I hope this does not

mean  that  rehabilitation  activities  for   the

hemiplegics and paraplegics at Mandalay Road, Tan

Tock  Seng  Hospital, have come to a rest.  Would

the  Minister for Health care to comment  on  the

matter raised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, there has been some misunderstanding on the

part  of  the Member for Punggol with  regard  to

this  vote.  As  a matter of fact,  the  original

submission  by  the Ministry of Health  for  this

item was an estimate of $42,000 for furniture and

equipment required for the rehabilitation  centre

at  Mandalay Road. This request was made in 1970,

and   Treasury  had  approved  the  project,   in

principle, by entering this request in the  1971-72 Development Estimates. However, a provision of

only $10,000 was shown in the 1971-72 Development

Estimates,  as Treasury was of the view  that  we

were unlikely to spend more than this sum in that

financial  year  1971-72. However,  Treasury  was

requested  to make the full provision of  $42,000

for   furniture  and  equipment  in  the  1972-73

Development Estimates. They have agreed, and this

accounts for the present figure. Therefore, there

is  actually no increase in the cost of furniture

or  equipment.  It has remained  unchanged  since

1970  at  a  total  figure of $42,000  which  was

approved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In view of the clarification by

the  Minister for Health, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 603.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope this time I would not be corrected

again. There was a provision of $1.5 million  for

last  year  to purchase some 37 refuse collection

vehicles so as to step up public cleansing in the

Republic.  It is bad to note that only  $600  has

been  spent, because there is still a  revote  of

$1,499,400.  Sir,  I  would  have  expected  that

because the provision was made, every opportunity

would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



taken to buy these vehicles as early as possible.

However, apparently this has not been the case. I

would  like to know why these vehicles  were  not

purchased,  particularly  when  there  have  been

complaints  over the inadequacy of such  vehicles

to  cope  up with the ever-increasing  volume  of

refuse.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

explanation lies as follows. The release of funds

under  this  vote  is subject to the  Development

Planning Committee sanction. In this case,  there

have been some protracted negotiations between my

Ministry and the Ministry of Finance with respect

to  the  number  and  type of  refuse  collection

vehicles  required.  When  approval  was  finally

obtained,  it was unfortunately too late  in  the

year to place orders and to pay for the vehicles.

These  special refuse collection vehicles  cannot

be  bought off the shelf so to speak, like sundry

goods.  The delivery period is about  six  to  12

months.   The  funds  were  accordingly  revoted.

Tenders for the supply of these refuse collection

vehicles  have already been finalised and  orders

are  being  placed. I can assure the  Member  for

Punggol that this money will be spent this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In the light of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of

Messrs Ng Yeow Chong and Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 605.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> I am not moving,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 605.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a token provision of $10 for

Refuse Treatment and Disposal Plants in the  last

financial year. This year there is a provision of

$750,000.  Hence, I think there must be something

in the offing, and there must also be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



shortage of land for dumping to warrant this vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to know from the Minister for Health

what  progress has been made with respect  to  the

provision of Refuse Treatment and Disposal Plants.

As stated by the Minister for Health in this House

on  the  26th  of  March last year,  and  I  quote

Hansard, Volume 30, col. 1420:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...there is a firm of consulting engineers who are

doing  a  survey  to ascertain the  most  suitable

method   or  combination  of  methods  for  refuse

disposal in Singapore. Their report is expected to

be submitted on the 10th of April.'



<br>Sir,  can the Minister inform this House what will

be done with this provision for 1972-73?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has

been  progress since then. The report by that firm

of  consulting engineers has already been received

and  has been considered. In fact, the report  has

recommended that a huge incinerator together  with

one or two compaction plants be built to take care

of the refuse disposal for the whole of Singapore.

The  matter is in the hands of Treasury,  who  now

has the task of raising enormous sums of money  to

purchase this huge incinerator, which incidentally

will  cost about $50 million, and also to purchase

the  compaction  plant. The specific  proposal  is

that  this compaction plant has a capacity of  400

tons  per  day  and  the  incineration  plant  can

dispose about 1.200 tons per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Punggol that this is

a  matter of urgency, because we are at the moment

running short of swampland to dump our refuse, and

the  amount  of  refuse  collected  every  day  is

increasing very rapidly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in the light of his reply

just  now, may I know from the Minister for Health

where  will the two plants be sited and when  will

they commence operations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As far as siting of the

plants is concerned, there is no definite decision

yet. I hope it is not

going to be in the Punggol constituency. But  with

regard to date as to when they will be set up, let

me  say that this is not a small project. It takes

some  time to process the report and tenders  have

to be called. But before tenders are called, funds

will have to be raised, perhaps through loans from

banks  or  international organisations. Then  only

after   it  has  been  decided  that  a  type   of

incineration  plant is best suited  for  Singapore

will   the  contract  be  awarded  to  build   the

incineration plant. So it seems that it will  take

at   least  another  two  years  before  work  can

commence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of Mr Yeo Choo Kok, the following

amendment, standing in his name, was not proceeded

with -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 he

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that this provision is for the

mechanisation of the Public Cleansing Services.  I

would  like to request the Minister for Health  to

elaborate on this item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, as I have stated quite

recently, there is a shortage of cleansing workers

in  Singapore, and therefore a start has got to be

made  to mechanise our cleansing work. Due to  the

high  rate  of turnover of cleansing  workers  who

resign  to  take  up more lucrative  jobs  in  the

industrial sector, the Public Cleansing Branch  of

the Ministry of Health is at the moment working on

a  field strength of about only 83 per cent. Also,

with the high degree of literacy among our younger

population,  public cleansing work  is  not  their

first  or  second  choice of an  occupation.  That

being  the case, the situation, as far as shortage

of cleansing workers is concerned, is not going to

improve  as  the  years  go  by.  Therefore,   the

solution is to mechanise public cleansing. But, as

I have stated before,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



street  cleansing work is labour-intensive and  to

mechanise it would mean that there will be quite a

number   of   problems   associated   with    such

mechanisation. For example, the mechanical sweeper

will  not be able to sweep drains, scupper  holes,

side-tables,  and so on. Further, with  regard  to

side  lanes where we have hawkers and car  parking

lots, the operation of the mechanical sweeper will

be quite limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as the financial provision for

mechanisation  is  concerned,  we   have   already

ordered  four  mechanical  road  sweepers  with  a

suction device. For the information of the  Member

for  Punggol, they will be arriving in June. First

of  all, we will use them to clean the main  roads

as a pilot scheme. If they prove to be successful,

they will be used to clean other roads as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light of

the reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)That the sum to be allocated for Head 81 he

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Teong Eng Siong)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this provision is a loan to the Jurong Town

Corporation. I would like to take this opportunity

to  raise  a  few questions regarding the  housing

estate  in  Jurong Town. We know  that  in  recent

years  there has been rapid development in  Jurong

Town  and there has been an increase in population

which  number  about 30,000 now.  However,  it  is

regrettable to say that the J.T.C, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



only concerned with the need for housing, and  has

not   paid   enough  attention  to  beautify   the

environment  or  to promote environmental  health.

According   to   complaints  received   from   the

residents there and the observations I have  made,

I  can  summarise a few points. I would  like  the

Minister to note what I am going to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the grass, the lawn and the trees in the

housing  estate  in  Jurong  Town  have  not  been

properly taken care of. Many fields are left  bare

without  grass, and the trees in Jurong  Town  are

not  growing  bigger, although  they  are  growing

older.  Perhaps the soil is not very suitable,  or

it  may  be  due  to other factors,  such  as  air

pollution thus stunting the growth of the trees. I

hope  the  Minister will urge the J.T.C, to  look

into  this. Otherwise the trees will not grow  any

taller, and will be stunted forever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the complaint is that there are

insufficient playing grounds for the children. The

J.T.C, is only concerned with building houses  and

have  neglected the need for playgrounds and other

amenities.   This  is  not  proper,  because   the

children  have no place to go to in the  evenings.

Hence,   the   importance   of   playing   fields.

Therefore,  some  space  should  be  reserved  for

playgrounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the collection of rubbish and refuse. I

have  received  complaints that the collection  of

refuse  and  rubbish  has not  been  regular.  The

result   is  that  a  stench  emanates  from   the

accumulated   refuse  and  rubbish  heaps.   After

investigation, I found that the J.T.C, contracted

out  the  work of disposing the rubbish to private

contractors, but the contractors have bidded a low

tender  and  therefore their service is  not  very

satisfactory.  I would like the Minister  to  note

that  the  J.T.C, should get proper and  efficient

contractors to do this job. Even if they  can  get

contractors to collect and dispose of the  rubbish

at  a  very low cost, it is useless if they cannot

do it properly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the flats put up by the J.T.C.,

especially  those recently built, are concentrated

in  a  small place and in close proximity to  each

other.  The distance between one block and another

is, I think, only about 10 feet. I hope the J.T.C.

will  build flats with liberal empty space between

the blocks so that there is more privacy.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point is the serious problem of air

pollution.  Many residents have complained  to  me

that every morning there is a lot of black soot in

the  air.  This  probably comes from  the  factory

chimneys. I hope the Minister concerned will  take

note of air pollution in Jurong Town.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  let me first pay a tribute to the Government

for  its  brilliant  success in industrialisation.

Before  industrialisation was embarked  upon,  our

country  was  faced with a very grave unemployment

problem.   However,   as   a   result   of   rapid

industrialisation in this country  over  the  past

five or six years, we have been able to solve  our

unemployment problem. The number of people working

in the factories is now more than 100,000. This is

a  great success by any standard, and I would like

to  express  my  admiration  to  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation.  Jurong  is not  only  an  industrial

estate,  but  is  also a place with  many  tourist

attractions. For example, there is the Jurong Bird

Park  with  beautiful gardens  and  various  other

tourist  attractions. There are  also  playgrounds

and recreational parks for our local citizens. The

Member  for  Jurong will observe  that  there  are

certain areas which could be developed. He  should

bring  them  to  the attention of the  Government,

because he is the Member for Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to tell this

House  how is it that this provision will be  used

for  industrialisation? What projects are  in  the

offing  to  promote  further industrialisation  in

Jurong?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  first, I would like  to  give  the

Member   some   information  on  the   Development

Expenditure of Jurong Town Corporation  for  1972-73.  The  total amount to be spent will be  $120.5

million,   made  up  of  $50  million   for   land

acquisition and resettlement and $70.5 million for

development   projects.   The   details   of   the

Development Expenditure have been published in the

Government  Gazette of 17th December,  last  year.

However,  perhaps I may summarise the  details  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation will spend $50 million on land

acquisition and resettlement this year.  The  main

items  are $24.9 million for 1,197 acres in Jurong

Town; $17.4 million for 64 acres in Kallang Basin,

and  $7.2  million for 311 acres for  resettlement

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation will spend $70.5 million on

development projects this year. The details are as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is expected to finance from its

own  resources an estimated $40.5 million  of  the

total  development expenditure of $120.5  million.

The   balance  of  $80  million  required  by  the

Corporation to finance its development expenditure

would,   therefore,  have  to   be   provided   by

Government in the form of loans, and this  is  the

provision  which has been entered under  Head  91,

subhead 001, of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Jurong's questions,

the  amounts which have been provided for  Jurong

Park  $4.3  million; .Jurong pier and  restaurant

$80,000,  improvements to social  amenities  $4.2

million,  will be sufficient proof that  we  have

provided  considerable sums  for  improvement  of

environmental conditions. The allocation of funds

is  always a matter of judgment. However, I would

say that as the Minister for Finance -this is not

necessarily  the attitude I took when  I  was  in

charge of Jurong development - the amounts  which

have been provided for sports complexes, swimming

pools, playgrounds, parks, Jurong Bird Park,  and

so  on, are more than adequate for the purposes.

In  fact, I am not quite sure whether the amounts

provided,  in  relation to other  constituencies,

are  not excessive. Having listened to the recent

debate on the provision for overhead bridges  and

other amenities for Sembawang, I think that  $4.3

million for Jurong Park is certainly ample.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also taken note of the comment of the

Member for Jurong on the health of the trees  and

grasses. I am not responsible for this and  other

details    of    Jurong   housekeeping    -    my

responsibility   being   confined    to    giving

directions  to  the  Jurong Town  Corporation  on

matters  affecting policy. I am sure he  is  more

keenly interested and, therefore, he would have a

greater  knowledge  of  the  details  of   Jurong

development. However. I am prepared  to  pass  on

his  comments to the Jurong Town Corporation  for

their   consideration.  1  have  been  given   to

understand,  however, that some of  his  comments

are   not  necessarily  correct.  The  Parks  and

Recreation Unit of the Jurong Town Corporation is

continuing  to  provide from its  nursery  enough

trees  for  planting especially  in  the  housing

areas  and  in  open spaces, in addition  to  the

roadside  planting carried out by the  Trees  and

Parks  Unit  of  the Public Works Department.  In

1971  the  number of trees planted by the  Jurong

Town  Corporation is 14,800, and  the  number  of

shrubs   74,900.   This  is  considerably   heavy

planting. As for the statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



that  the trees are growing older but not bigger,

I  think this is merely an impression. Some trees

are  slow-growing  and, therefore,  the  Member's

impression  that  they are not  thriving  is  not

correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to refuse from the residential flats

in  Jurong  Town,  I understand  that  refuse  is

collected   by   the   Jurong  Town   conservancy

contractor every day and deposited in the various

bin centres set up by the Ministry of Health.  As

far  as  I know, the Public Health Department  of

the  Ministry of Health regularly clear the  bins

every  day.  They have checked on  this.  Perhaps

sometimes  unusually large amounts of refuse  may

be  accumulated  after the daily  clearing,  arid

this  could  have given the impression  that  the

refuse is not collected daily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about the design of

the  flats and that the blocks of flats  are  too

close to one another, the position is as follows.

The  distance between each 10-storey block is  90

feet  and between each 5-storey block is 50 feet,

when the flats are facing one another. This ratio

is  the  same  as for Queenstown  and  Toa  Payoh

housing  estates. In the design  of  the  special

type  of  staggered-blocks of 4-room  flats, the

.Jurong Town Corporation thought that the hack of

the  block of flats should face the back  of  the

other block of fiats and, therefore, you have the

kitchens  of  one block facing those  of  another

block.  But  the  front of each block  of  flats.

which  face the opposite direction, would have  a

vast  open area so that the sitting room and  the

main bedroom will not face those of another flat,

thus  affording greater privacy for the  tenants.

The distance between the kitchens in the rear  of

two  blocks  of  flats in the first  experimental

stage  is 22� feet. This was necessitated by  the

small site available and the necessity to provide

ample  open space for car parking areas. But  the

distance  between the kitchens of two  blocks  of

such  flats  now under construction  will  be  35

feet, which should be considered as standard.  A

distance  of more than 35 feet will, I think  add

to the cost of construction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   will  the  Minister  for  Finance  consider

lowering the rate of interest which is charged  on

that  portion  of  the loan  to  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  used for the building of  social  and

recreational  facilities?  I  am  told  that   the

admission  fees for the Bird Park are as  high  as

they  are  because  of  the  exorbitant  rate   of

interest,  which is about 7X per cent, charged  by

the  Ministry of Finance for their loan. If we add

the  fact  that  property tax is  payable  on  the

properties, then the charges to the public for the

use of such facilities must necessarily be high.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the interest

rates  for  the various loans to the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  have been carefully  negotiated  with

them.  I am sure they are capable of looking after

their own interests. In so far as the Ministry  of

Finance is concerned, the question of the  use  of

these  loans has been considered. But in the  case

of  the Jurong Bird Park, which is supposed to  he

run  like any other private company, the terms  on

which  the Jurong Bird Park gets its finance  will

he  on  commercial terms. Whether or not the  Bird

Park  will  be  able  to pay its  way  is  another

matter.  But  for  accounting  purposes,   it   is

necessary to make quite sure that if the Bird Park

is intended to be run like a limited company, then

they should not be given any hidden subsidy.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister for Finance has explained  just  now

that   a   certain  sum  has  been  allotted   for

recreational  and other purposes in Jurong,  e.g..

the   expenditure  on  the  Bird  Park  and  other

recreational  amenities.  I  would  like  to  know

whether  a  concessionary rate will  be  given  to

residents   of   Jurong  Town   to   enjoy   these

recreational amenities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I have already stated in my

reply to the debate on the annual Budget Statement

that I would pass on the request for lower charges

to the Jurong Bird Park (Private)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



Limited,  which is a private company.  The  Member

for   Whampoa  has  suggested  the  reduction   of

admission fees by charging lower interest rates on

the loans. I have rejected this. I am sure that if

the  fees are lowered, it may then be a matter  of

calculating  whether or not the reduction  in  the

charges would result in more visitors going to the

Jurong Bird Park. And if such calculation promises

a  greater number of visitors resulting in  higher

gate  receipts.  I  am sure the Jurong  Bird  Park

(Private) Limited will be only too happy to  adopt

the suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I spoke

to the Chairman of the Jurong Town Corporation, he

told  me  that he was just trying to cover  costs.

But when I asked the Minister for Finance, he said

it  is a commercial venture. I do not know exactly

where we stand. I appreciate the reason that maybe

we  should not subsidise by reducing the  rate  of

interest  to, say, four or five per  cent  on  the

loans  to the Company. But I would think that  six

per  cent,  which  is the rate  of  interest  that

people  normally get on fixed deposits, would  be

the  rate  to  charge, for then we  would  not  be

subsidising nor would we be making any profit. But

by  charging 7- per cent commercial rate,  as  the

Minister  rightly acknowledged, he is passing  the

buck over to the private company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have got to make the decision whether

the  Bird  Park  should be  run  as  a  commercial

proposition  or whether it is to be considered  as

an  amenity  for  the people to  enjoy,  and  then

determine the rate accordingly. I do not think  we

should  keep  on  passing the  ball  to  and  fro,

especially  in new social amenities like  swimming

pools which are going to be provided by the Jurong

Town  Corporation. They have got to  pass  on  the

rate  of interest which they have to pay, even  if

it is just simply to cover their cost of operation

and not to make a profit at their end. It does not

mean  that the Minister for Finance should make  a

profit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the question of covering

costs  and of perhaps making something above  that

is not inconsistent. First of all, they should try

to cover their costs. If they cannot, then perhaps

there  would be a question of a subsidy, in  which

case,  of  course, it would be properly  accounted

for   as   a   subsidy  under  Contributions   and

Charitable Allowances. As far as the Bird Park  is

concerned, we are trying to run it as a commercial

proposition. There are zoos and other  bird  parks

run  on this basis. If the Jurong Town Corporation

can succeed, so much the better for them, and this

will  be  a feather in the cap of the Chairman  of

the Jurong Bird Park (Private) Limited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that this is a loan of $25 million

to  the Public Utilities Board. I do not know what

the  P.U.B, is going to do with the $25  million.

Anyway,  I wish to raise some queries. I  wish  to

query  the P.U.B, on the manner in which it  deals

with  the  public as far as deposit  accounts  are

concerned.  Let me point out an example.  A  widow

who wanted to transfer the account of her husband,

who  was  the sole breadwinner in the family,  was

asked  to  pay  another deposit and  start  a  new

account.  I  want to know why the deposit  already

paid  by the husband cannot be used. She was  told

that  the  original deposit will be refunded  only

later on and subject to a claim for it. May I  ask

why  is the P.U.B, so heartless, especially to the

lower-income group? The P.U.B, seems to  give  the

impression to the public that it is doing  a  very

big favour for a very small service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a further example of how the P.U.B.

metes out a shabby form of treatment to the lower-income  group.  The  rich  who  can  afford   air-

conditioners  in their homes are charged  a  lower

rate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



for  their  electricity supply. While  unfortunate

people  who only want better ventilation by  using

fans  are  charged a higher rate because fans  can

only be connected to the lighting points. This  is

a  terrible injustice on the part of P.U.B. It  is

high  time that this unjust form of charges should

be brought in line with the socialist practice. It

is  also  hoped that when the P.U.B, introduces  a

uniform  rate  of  charges  for  both  power   and

lighting in the near future its officers will take

into  consideration the plight of the lower-income

group.  To  charge a uniform rate  for  power  and

lighting  is  a  good  idea.  But  it  must  be  a

reasonable charge for the lower-income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that the P.U.B, is

using naphtha as feedstock in order to reduce  air

pollution.  Is the P.U.B, aware that  Singaporeans

are  finding  it cheaper to use the commercialised

bottled  gas, and has the P.U.B, any intention  of

reducing the charge for their domestic gas  so  as

to  compete  at par with commercial  suppliers  of

bottled gas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision

of  $25 million to the P.U.B, is for any shortfall

in financing which may be experienced by them. The

P.U.B, gets  most  of  its  money  from  external

sources,  the  Asian  Development  Bank   or   the

International   Bank   for   Reconstruction    and

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On matters of detail which the Member has

brought  up, I am given to understand that,  under

the  Board's existing procedure, when  a  consumer

transfers his account to another person,  the  new

consumer  must be prepared to pay the  liabilities

of  the old consumer. It is either that or he pays

a  new  deposit  until the old  account  has  been

settled.  Where  the  new consumer  pays  his  own

deposit, the old consumer's deposit will  then  be

used  to settle any of the outstanding charges  on

the  closing  of the account and the  balance, of

course,  will  then  be  refunded  to  whoever  is

entitled  to  it or to the administrators  of  the

estate.  This is perhaps a matter of detail  which

could be pursued with the P.U.B, direct.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electricity charges, I have given an

explanation to the Member for Telok Blangah in the

debate  on  the  Budget Statement.  The  Board  is

preparing  to  introduce a  new  single  meter  of

domestic  tariff  for  both  lighting  and   power

consumption,  so  that the discrimination  between

the  two kinds of electricity - one for power  and

another   for  lighting  -  would  be   eliminated

shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the use of bottled gas, this is a matter

which  every  consumer  must  decide  for  himself

whether  bottled  gas is cheaper  or  whether  the

P.U.B, gas  supply is cheaper  as  well  as  more

convenient. It would appear, however,  that  there

are   enough  consumers  who  consider  PUB, gas

competitive with other methods of heating, and the

P.U.B, has been extending its gas supply to  ever

larger areas. The P.U.B, considers the price to be

both reasonable and competitive.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am aware of the reply

given  by the Minister for Finance to the question

asked by the Member for Telok Blangah. What I want

to  know is whether the Minister for Finance  will

direct  the P.U.B, to take into consideration  the

plight  of the lower-income group when fixing  the

single rate for power and lighting. The main point

of  my question is that the rates for lower-income

group should be slightly lower than the rates  for

the other income groups.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, this is a matter of policy

and I have no doubt that due consideration will be

given  to the lower-income group, as suggested  by

the Member. In fact, that is the case now. But as

I  understood the Member when he was speaking,  he

was  complaining  of  the  discrimination  between

those  who  get their cooling done  by  the  power

system and the others; i.e, the lower-income group

-  or  even the higher-income group, because  even

the  higher-income  group have fans  connected  to

lighting points - who have to pay the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



higher lighting rate for their electric fans. As I

have  said, that discrimination will be eliminated

when the new single tariff system is introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 003*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Teong Eng Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for 1971-72 the amount loaned to the Housing

and  Development Board totalled $100 million,  and

for  1972-73  a  loan  of $180  million  has  been

provided,  which  is an increase of  $80  million.

Last   week,   the  Minister  for   Health,   when

discussing  the allocation for the  Public  Health

Division,  said  that Alsagoff Estate  has  to  be

redeveloped before public health measures  can  be

carried  out.  Therefore, I wish to  know  whether

this  loan  to  the Housing and Development  Board

includes  development to be  carried  out  by  the

Housing  and  Development Board  in  the  Alsagoff

Estate.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to put forward a few questions to the

Minister  in  charge. Firstly,  can  the  Minister

explain to this House whether Alsagoff Estate  has

been  bought  over by the Housing and  Development

Board?  The reason for my question is that when  I

submitted  an  application for  amenities  to  the

Urban  and Rural Services Committee, they  replied

that permission is required from the landlord. And

when  the secretary of my C.C.C, sought permission

from  the Alsagoff Estate, the administrators said

that  they  no  longer  had powers  to  give  such

permission  because the land has been bought  over

by   the  Government.  However,  they  are   still

collecting  ground  rent  from  the  occupiers  of

Alsagoff  Estate every month. Secondly,  what  are

the development plans for this area, and when will

such   plans  be  implemented?  Thirdly,  in   the

implementation   of  the  development   plans   in

Alsagoff Estate,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



would  the  evicted families be given priority  of

employment in the factories in the area when  they

are   built,   as  has  been  mentioned   by   the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Law

and National Development, who is also the Chairman

of the U.R.S.C.? He has said so a little while ago

in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final question is when will the development

projects be started?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under

this  subhead we can see that the vote is for  the

Housing  and  Development  Board.  The  Board  has

undeniably contributed much and has achieved  very

good  results  in public housing.  At  the  moment

there  are  half a million people staying  in  the

flats  built by the Housing and Development Board.

Because of this we have successfully resolved  the

problem of housing shortage. On the other hand,  a

few  years  ago,  we  started  the  home-ownership

scheme under which we sold the flats to people  of

the  lower and middle income groups to enable them

to  possess  their own houses. This is a  laudable

project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise three questions which I

hope to get a reply from the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Where will the project be sited? I-low is

the  amount allocated under this vote going to  be

used and in what areas? Other than the building of

housing  estates, will the Housing and Development

Board  also  be  interested in  building  shopping

complexes and hawker centres?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I have received certain complaints from shop

tenants that the rentals are too high. They  would

like to request the Government to consider selling

the  shop premises to the present tenants on hire-purchase  terms. At the moment we have  the  home-

ownership  scheme for the dwellers,  and  I  think

perhaps we can also consider extending this scheme

to  tenants  of Housing Board shop premises.  This

will help to resolve their problem of high rentals

and  also help them to maintain their business.  I

remember I raised this question last year in  this

House,  and  the Minister replied  that  he  would

convey my suggestion to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



the  Housing and Development Board to carry out  a

survey  to  find  out  the response  of  the  shop

tenants. I would like to ask the Minister now what

was  the result of the survey and how good was the

response.  Are these shop tenants willing  to  buy

over  the shop premises constructed by the Housing

and Development Board?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Now that we are engaged in the Second Five-Year Development Plan, 20,000 units of flats will

be  built this year. There are many people on  the

waiting  list  for  flats,  and  they  are  rather

worried  because fewer and fewer flats  are  being

released  for rental. If they want to  buy  flats,

they must have some money in the Central Provident

Fund before they can register. And since the lower

income   group  do  not  have  sufficient   C.P.F.

deposits  at  their disposal, they are  not  in  a

position  to buy. So we should consider continuing

renting  out  flats to people in the lower  income

group.  I would like the Minister to give  serious

consideration to these suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, the sum of $180 million is

provided  in  the  1972-73  Development  Estimates

under   this   subhead,  "Loan  to   Housing   and

Development Board", for its programme for the year

1972-73.   Government  loans  to  the  Board   are

determined  on  the  basis of  their  own  overall

building programme. The target this year is 20,000

units  of flats, and the loan is to meet the total

financial needs for the year. As such, the loan is

not  specifically  tied to any particular  housing

project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Alsagoff Estate is concerned, the

Government will, of course, provide the  necessary

loans to the Housing and Development Board, but as

I have pointed out before, any overall development

of  this  low-lying area will first require  major

road  and  drainage improvement schemes. The  Sims

Avenue extension was completed last year. The Pan-Island  Expressway from Paya Lebar Road  to  Jalan

Eunos  will  be  completed soon; I believe,  in  a

month  or two. Further, both Jalan Eunos and Jalan

Ubi,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



as  the Member for Kampong Kembangan is aware, are

being widened and improved and brighter lights are

being installed along these two roads. I think the

Member     appreciates    that    the    necessary

infrastructure  has to be laid for pre-development

of  the whole area which also has to be taken into

consideration   extensions  to  the   Paya   Lebar

Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for acquisition, the land north of the Pan-Island Expressway was gazetted for acquisition on

the 2nd February last year, and the land south  of

the Expressway on the 20th September last year.  A

survey of the population in the area has not  been

completed  and  possession of  the  land  not  yet

taken,  so that some projects by the U.R.S.C, may

still  need  the  consent of the trustees  of  the

estate  concerned.  But  the  stumbling  block  to

redevelopment is, of course, resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the two new roads which I have

mentioned,    there   were   1,200    cases    for

resettlement, involving about 4,000 persons. On  a

rough  estimate, there would be more  than  15,000

cases  of  resettlement  involving  about  100,000

people  for the whole area. They cannot be evicted

or  resettled until new homes are built.  This  is

being  done in housing estates in Kallang, Geylang

East, Kampong Chai Chee, and the Bedok new town on

the  cut  side between Changi Road and Upper  East

Coast Road. I assure the Member that steps will be

taken to provide low-cost housing within the  area

itself  together with light industrial  facilities

to  cater for the needs of the residents. A  large

part  of  the estate lies in the way  of  the  air

route  which  aeroplanes take  when  departing  or

arriving  at  Paya  Lebar Airport,  and  buildings

along  this  stretch of land must  necessarily  be

low.  I  would  like to reassure the  Member  that

Geylang  Serai  is  very much in the  Government's

plans,  but  it will take many years  to  complete

plans  for its development. The area north of  the

Pan-Island Expressway will be developed first  and

later  the  area south, but the exact commencement

date for the development will depend on when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



we  can  find alternative homes. But homes  alone

are  not enough. People must not only be given new

homes  to move into but their capacity to  earn  a

living  from  light  industries,  which  could  be

profitably   established  in  the  area,   is   an

important    factor    in    rehabilitation    and

redevelopment.  With  the  co-operation   of   the

residents and the active support of the Member  of

Parliament  for  the  area, I  am  confident  that

Geylang  Serai  can  and will be  turned  into  an

attractive  and  well-planned area with  healthier

conditions for our citizens to live and work in.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Sembawang, he asked

certain  questions, one of which  is:  where  will

these  housing  projects be? I  mentioned  a  few.

There  are  other  projects all over  Singapore  -

Woodlands,  Toa  Payoh, Queenstown,  Farrer  Road,

Redhill,  Telok Blangah are some of  the  few.  He

asked:  will there be shopping centres and  hawker

centres? Certainly. But he complained that some of

the rentals of shops are too high, and at the same

time and in the same breath he said they wanted to

buy.  This  is what I do not understand.  If  they

cannot pay the rents, which they say are too high,

how  can  they afford to buy? But on this question

of wanting to buy shops, it is not the same as the

home-ownership  scheme for  tenants  who  live  in

flats. The qualifications are different. Hence  it

is also difficult to sell. You do not have to be a

citizen  of Singapore to tender for a Housing  and

Development Board shop premises, but you  have  to

be  a  citizen of Singapore if you want to  buy  a

Housing Board flat to live in. So are we to extend

this scheme to non-citizens too? If we do sell, we

must  obviously sell to everybody. We cannot  pick

and  choose.  That  is just one  reason.  But  the

Housing  Board has considered this for  some  time

now  and, after the Member's request last year,  I

am afraid the answer is still no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for renting out - this is the third time I am

saying  this, probably the Member has not been  in

the  House - I gave the assurance that 20 per cent

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



the  new two-room and three-room flats will still

be let out, and 80 per cent will be sold. But, of

course, the one-room flats are the ones that  are

in demand, and most of them are being let out.  I

think  there  is  only one per cent  of  one-room

flats that have been sold. In other words, it  is

cheaper to rent them.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I wish

to  assure  the  Minister for  Law  and  National

Development that the problem of resettlement will

not  be  difficult. I believe that  the  Minister

knows  how the Housing and Development Board  had

resettled the families affected by the Pan-Island

Expressway project. Likewise, Sir, if  this  area

is  redeveloped,  I am sure the  residents  there

will  give  their  fullest  co-operation  to  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, the Minister said that the

first   problem   is   resettlement   and    that

development will take place in a few years' time.

Sir,   the  problem  which  will  arise  if  this

development were to take place in a few years  is

that  the residents there will continue  to  live

under  conditions where they will have bad  roads

and   flooded  drains,  including  the   mosquito

menace,   if  the  U.R.S.C, cannot  give   prior

consideration to repair the bad roads and drains.

The  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for

National  Development said just now that  because

these areas are affected by redevelopment, it  is

not  wise to repair the by-roads in the area.  If

this  area  is not going to be developed,  or  it

will  take  a long time to develop it,  it  means

that   the  residents  there  will  continue   to

experience  the  difficulties  which   they   had

experienced  over the past years. In implementing

this  redevelopment, Sir, will the  residents  be

given  facilities and equal, if not more priority

than  the residents who are affected in the other

areas, in matters such as compensation, choice of

alternative accommodation offered by the  Housing

and  Development Board, and whether they will  be

permitted  to  return to their old place  it  and

when the Housing and Development Board flats  are

completed? If these problems can be considered by

the Minister for National Development, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



can  assure  him  the residents  there  will  co-operate whole-heartedly with the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a  while  ago, the Minister  said  that  if

people cannot afford to pay the high rentals  for

Housing  and Development Board shop premises,  he

does  not understand how they can afford  to  buy

them. I would like to tell the Minister that this

is  a long-term investment plan. They can try  to

get  a  larger sum of money as a deposit. If  the

property belongs to them they do not have to  pay

the  high rental. So the instalment payment  will

be  less than the payment for rental of the  shop

premises. Then they will be able to tide over and

continue  to  do  their business on  a  long-term

investment basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the survey, the Minister said that

the  result was "no". I wonder whether  this  was

based  on  the  response  after  the  survey,  or

whether the "no" came direct from him. I hope the

Minister will be able to clarify these points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his mention that there is a problem

between  selling  Housing Board premises  to  our

citizens   and   non-citizens,   some   kind   of

adjustment can be made. Of course, we should look

after  our own citizens first and give  them  the

priority of buying these premises. After the non-citizens  have  got their citizenship,  they  may

then  be  qualified  to buy  Housing  Board  shop

premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, the Minister said that the

Housing  and  Development Board  has  decided  to

allot  20 per cent of flats for rent. I think  it

is  not  enough  because I have information  that

there  are more than 10,000 people on the waiting

list  to rent flats. In other words, 20 per  cent

of  the  new two-room and three-room flats  would

number  about  4,000 units. But if there  are  at

present  more than 10,000 people on  the  waiting

list,  after five years there will be  more  than

100,000  people which means that every  applicant

will  have to wait for more than two years before

he can be allotted a flat for rent. So I hope the

Minister can consider increasing the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



percentage of flats for rent to 40 per cent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if we raise the rate of flats

for  rent  to 40 per cent, there will be  less  to

sell.  I do not want to get into an argument  with

the  Member about either financial or construction

figures of the Housing Board. But the waiting list

to  buy has left the waiting list to rent very far

behind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the survey, the answer "no" did not come

from the survey but from the Housing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can deal with the questions raised by the

Member for Kampong Kembangan, Geylang Serai is,  I

think,  involved in this Alsagoff Estate. I cannot

tell him exactly when development plans will start

except to indicate that the area north of the Pan-Island  Expressway  will be developed  first.  The

Member  said  that  if  we  can  find  alternative

accommodation  for  these 4,000  people  stretched

along   the   two  roads,  surely  we   can   find

accommodation for the others. The answer  is  yes.

But  it takes time. There were 4,000 along the two

roads,  but there are 100,000 in the whole estate.

That  is quite a big number. The Member also asked

whether  some  of the residents affected  will  be

allowed to go back. The answer is yes, but  surely

not  all.  It  is difficult to evict everyone  and

then put them back. But I am sure some of them can

go back if they love the place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for compensation and resettlement rates, they

will be entitled to the current rates. It makes no

difference   whether  they  come  from  Kembangan,

Geylang Serai, Sembawang, or Jurong - everybody is

paid  the same rates. As for priority, of  course,

they  will  be  given priority for  Housing  Board

accommodation.  If  they are not  given  priority,

then  they  are  not resettled  and  there  is  no

redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan also asked

about  priority for employment. I  think  that  is

difficult to give. We cannot force any employer to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



employ  whoever  the  Member  would  like  to   be

employed.  Of  course,  they  will  be  given  the

opportunity to apply for such employment, and this

is  up to the employer. But the whole intention is

to try and set up light industries within the area

so  that  the people not only can live there,  but

can also find employment in the area.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as the Minister has stated, he himself  does

not know how long it will take to develop the area

north  of  the Pan-Island Expressway. He has  just

stated  that this area will be developed first.  I

want  an assurance from the Minister that  in  the

meantime  the drains, roads, and the  by-roads  of

this  area  be  repaired by  the  U.R.S.C, before

commencement of the development projects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am sorry, Sir, that I did not deal

with  that  point. Just because there  will  be  a

little  delay in redevelopment, it does  not  mean

that  the  whole  area will be neglected.  As  the

Member knows, the area has not been neglected.  As

I  pointed  out earlier, two big roads  have  been

built,  one  is the extension of Sims Avenue,  and

the  other  the Pan-Island Expressway  right  from

Paya  Lebar  Road to Jalan Eunos,  which  will  be

completed  in  a  month or two. Lights  have  been

installed  along  these two roads.  Jalan  Ubi  is

being widened and improved. These are major roads,

and  therefore  they are being attended  to.  They

cost millions of dollars. There have been requests

to repair minor roads within the area, but not all

of  them  have been attended to because there  are

also  other roads in other areas, and we  have  to

strike  a  balance between Kampong  Kembangan  and

Chua  Chu  Kang, or between Kampong Kembangan  and

Jurong,   or   between   Kampong   Kembangan   and

Sembawang. However, I can assure the Member  that,

subject  to  priorities,  repairs  to  roads   and

building  of  drains within his  constituency  and

within Geylang Serai will continue.

Minister's  Office. But that part  of  Jalan  Ubi

which   is  in  my  constituency  has  not   been

improved. Nevertheless, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 007.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Telephone Board has been

complaining   for  many  years  about   acts   of

vandalism on public telephones. Can this  act  of

vandalism be prevented by lighting the booths  so

that  such acts can easily be detected? This will

be  a  deterrent  to  those intending  to  damage

public telephones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Telephone Board can increase its

earnings  by installing more coinafons in  coffee

shops.  Many of the public telephone  booths  are

sited  in obscure places. The design of the booth

is  such that the weather has not been taken into

consideration.  Is  there any means  whereby  the

Singapore  Telephone  Board  could  introduce   a

timing  device in public telephone booths whereby

a  caller is limited to only a few minute's  use?

At  present  it  is  common to see  inconsiderate

people  using public telephones for long periods

at  a  time  when  a number of other  people  are

waiting to use them. I would also suggest that  a

burglar alarm be installed, so that when the coin

box  is being broken into, it will sound a  siren

so that the culprit can easily be apprehended. It

is  also noted that certain public telephones are

out  of  order, and it would be some weeks before

they  are  repaired. Will the Singapore Telephone

Board  undertake immediate repairs to telephones

which are out of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully concur with the

concern  expressed by the Member for  Anson  over

the  question of acts of vandalism to our  public

telephones.  However, I am pleased  to  say  that

such  acts  of vandalism have shown a  noticeable

decline in recent years. There were 670 cases  in

1970,  but  the number has gone down  to  237  in

1971, Of particular significance is the number of

incidents  where  coin boxes  were  broken  into.

There were as many as 337 cases in 1970, but  the

number  went  down to only 37 for last  year.  Of

course,  we  must give credit to the  Police  for

having arrested a very persistent culprit late in

1970. The case was reported in the press. I would

like to express my appreciation of the Police, as

conditions have since improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I should like to take this opportunity

to  mention the various measures which have  been

taken  by the Singapore Telephone Board to reduce

acts  of  vandalism. It is unfortunate that  some

people who use public telephones are inclined to

put  match  sticks into the dials, and  therefore

jamming the mechanism. These are minor irritants.

But  when  we  have cases of severe  damage,  for

example,  when  the handsets  are  smashed  -  we

consider  this  a  major damage -  the  Singapore

Telephones Board has been instructed to  contact,

first, the Member of Parliament for that area  to

seek   his  assistance, because  he  knows   his

constituents best. He may know where the bad hats

are  and  where  the troublesome  people  usually

congregate.  Therefore,  through  the  Member  of

Parliament,  we will also be able to  liase  with

the   Citizens'  Consultative  Committee,   whose

members  are at the grass-root level.  They  know

which  streets are "good" and which  streets  are

"not   very  good"  for  the  siting  of   public

telephones. It is through the assistance and  co-operation  of  Members  of  Parliament  and   the

Citizens'  Consultative Committees that  we  have

been  able  to reduce the previous high  rate  of

vandalism and to bring it down to a check.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Singapore Telephone Board also

secures the assistance of the Vigilante Corps. For

instance,   in   the  course  of   their   duties,

especially  at  night, they could pass  by  public

telephones  booths more often than  usual  and  to

keep   an   eye   on  them.  This  assistance   is

particularly   sought  where  there   are   public

telephones in remote areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Singapore Telephone Board has begun

to remove the spring doors of telephone booths. In

the  past we thought that wooden doors would  give

the users some privacy. However, we now think that

this  is  not a good idea. We are going to  remove

the doors so that if anyone tries to prise open  a

coin  box, he can easily be seen by passers-by  or

by the Police patrol cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there will be more frequent visits to

the  telephone  booths by the Singapore  Telephone

Board coin collectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the measures we have taken so far, but

other  measures  are being contemplated.  Firstly,

public  telephones will be located in  conspicuous

places, like community centres. Secondly,  we  are

considering the possibility of installing  burglar

alarms,  as  has been suggested by the Member  for

Anson.  Of  course,  such  devices  can  only   be

installed  if the cost is not too prohibitive.  It

should be reasonably economical. If we install  an

alarm which costs $1,000 in order to collect $10 a

month,  then it is not economical. Of  course,  we

will  try  to educate the public through the  mass

media, that is, the radio and the television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also consider the question of lighting

the  booths. Here it is a question of cost. Is  it

economically  worthwhile to provide  lighting  for

the  booths  as  against  the  provision  of  more

coinafons  in coffee shops? We will have  to  look

into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the timing device for public

telephones, it is true that some people do put  in

ten cents and talk for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



half  an  hour.  This is unreasonable,  especially

when there are other people waiting to make use of

the   telephone.   We  are  now  considering   the

possibility  of introducing a timing device  which

will automatically disconnect the call after three

minutes. The cost of such a device is estimated at

$150.   As  there  are  more  than  1,200   public

telephones, the capital expenditure involved could

amount  to $200,000. It is a sizable sum to  spend

on  such a device. We will have to study the  cost

benefits to see whether it is worthwhile to  spend

such a large sum of money. In the meantime, we can

only  hope that the public will cooperate, so that

if  they  do not make use of the public telephones

for  such a long time, we would not have to  spend

$200,000  to cut off the call automatically  after

three minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of vandalism, Sir, perhaps

this  is  a good opportunity for me to remind  the

House,  especially members of the public, that  we

do  have  the  Vandalism Act (Chapter 108)  where,

under  section  2  (b)  of this  Act,  an  act  of

vandalism   includes  "stealing,   destroying   or

damaging   any  public  property".   And   "public

property"   has  been  defined  as   "movable   or

immovable  property belonging to the Government...

or  to  any  statutory body...". And the Singapore

Telephone  Board is a statutory body.  Any  person

found  guilty  of  acts  of  vandalism,  such   as

stealing,  destroying or damaging public telephone

booths  is  liable, on conviction, to a  fine  not

exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not

exceeding three years, and shall also be  punished

with  caning with not less than three strokes  and

not   more   than  eight  strokes.  I  think   the

punishment  by  caning will  deter  many  acts  of

vandalism in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, in view of

the  Minister's long explanation and also his plea

for  cooperation on the part of the public, I  beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 91 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sim Boon Woo.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this provision of about $96 million is for

loans  to  industrial and commercial  enterprises.

This, I believe, is essential to enable commercial

and industrial enterprises to develop further. Can

the  Minister explain to this House how are  these

loans going to be used? I wish to know the details

concerning these loans. What are the projects  for

which   these  loans  are  given?  What  are   the

conditions for such loans and what is the rate  of

interest?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking on

this  subhead,  I  must  say  that  although   the

Development  Bank of Singapore was established  by

statute, I presume there is a sufficient safeguard

over the investment of public moneys, and that all

investments are made in good faith and  with  good

intent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to ask the Minister to be

more explicit than what is said in page 48 of  the

Memorandum  on  the Development  Estimates,  Paper

Misc.  I  of 1972. Sir, it would appear  that  the

Development Bank of Singapore has the lion's share

of  this  loan. But the House is not  sufficiently

informed  as  to  how  the  Development  Bank   of

Singapore will make use of this loan. As stated in

the  Memorandum, the Government has  approved  ten

lines  of credit to the Bank, totalling some  $411

million.  The  House  is  entitled  to  know  more

details before we are asked to approve any further

sums of public money.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next major beneficiary appears to be

the  Neptune Orient Lines Limited. I wish to  know

what class of ships and tankers is to be purchased

and their total tonnages. I presume that our local

shipbuilding industry will also benefit from  this

loan.  The  new addition of ships for the  Neptune

Orient Lines



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



Limited  will  naturally  be  built  by  our   own

shipyards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, for the financial year 1972-73, a sum of $96.1 million has been earmarked for

loans  to  industrial and commercial  enterprises.

These  loans  are  for  financing  part  of  their

operations.  The breakdown has been given  as  $58

million  for  the Development Bank  of  Singapore,

$11.5 million for Jurong Shipbuilders (Pte.) Ltd.,

$25 million for the Neptune Orient Lines, and $1.6

million for the other companies, making a total of

$96.1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans to the D.B.S, are intended for the purpose

of  assisting the Bank in financing  part  of  its

lending   operations,  mainly   in   manufacturing

industries, shipbuilding, real estate development,

transport  projects,  and  some  projects  of  the

M.S.A, for which loans are also to be provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines of credit, as indicated by their name,

are  not project loans. It means that the projects

are  not  known in advance. This is  the  kind  of

financing  which  the World  Bank  and  the  Asian

Development Bank do when they provide loans to the

Development  Bank of Singapore. A sum is  provided

and the disbursements are made upon projects being

received by the Development Bank of Singapore  and

carefully  assessed as to their credit-worthiness.

The  actual  projects  are  not  known  except  by

categories.  The lines of credit, of course,  have

been  given for various purposes, and some of them

are  for direct loans to manufacturing industries,

others  for real estate financing and for purchase

of  aircraft. One line of credit is to finance the

purchase  of  freedom-type vessels  built  by  the

Jurong  Ship-builders (Private) Ltd, for  Neptune

Orient Lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jurong Shipbuilders (Private),

Ltd, there  is also a loan to finance  the  major

part  of  the  cost  of  imported  materials   for

shipbuilding   during  the   initial   period   of

operation of the company.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Neptune Orient Lines Ltd, requires funds for

purchasing  a  number of ships  and  tankers.  The

details  are: dry cargo carriers, product  tankers

and  super  tankers  totalling 330,600  deadweight

tons,  of  which  306,600 would  represent  tanker

tonnage.  These vessels have to be  built  outside

Singapore  because Singapore's shipyards  are  not

yet  capable  of  building some of these  vessels.

However,  wherever possible, Neptune Orient  Lines

has  been  building the vessels in Singapore.  For

instance,  four  freedom-type  multi-purpose   dry

cargo   vessels   are  being   built   by   Jurong

Shipbuilders.  These  ships  will  have  a   total

tonnage of 59,200 deadweight tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of the loans is for small sums to be

given  to  various  partly-owned  or  wholly-owned

Government companies, including Keppel Shipyard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to

praise  the  Vigilante Corps. The Vigilante  Corps

has  played  an  important  part  in  helping   to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for this subhead is $109,580 for

the   construction  of  stores  at  the   training

centres.  I would like the Minister to inform  the

House, firstly, whether the Vigilante Corps has  a

lot of equipment and other items which require the

construction of stores. What are these items which

are   to  be  stored?  Secondly,  when  will   the

construction of the stores be completed?

training  in  the Vigilante Corps  begins  at  the

deployment  phase,  i.e, from the  second  to  the

fourth  year of national service in the  Vigilante

Corps.  An integral part of civil defence training

is  fire-fighting and rescue work. Such  training,

which  is  held at the nine V.C, training centres,

is conducted with the equipment essential for fire-fighting  and rescue work. The equipment  includes

water  trailer  pumps and portable pumps  at  each

training  centre. The stores which are at  present

under   construction   and   which   are   nearing

completion  will house these equipment  in  safety

and  in  proper  condition. At present,  Vigilante

Corps  members in the auxiliary fire  service  are

also  being trained as firemen to combat  airport,

harbour   and  city  fires.  The  auxiliary   fire

service,  which will be integrated with the  Civil

Defence  Organisation, will use these  stores  and

equipment  at  the  various centres  in  times  of

emergency.

as training and operational equipment. At present

the  equipment  which will be purchased  will  be

largely   for  training  purposes,  and  includes

trailer pumps, portable pumps as I have mentioned

just   now,   and   among  other   things, fire

extinguishers   and   hoses   for   fire-fighting

purposes.   Stretchers  and  essential   training

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, may I give a brief background to

this  Bill?  There are at present five  statutory

authorities dealing with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



matters relating to seafarers and seamen: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Seamen's Registry Board

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Seafarers' Welfare Board

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Singapore Mariners' Club

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Singapore Sailors' Institute

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Seamen's Lodging-Houses Licensing Authority.



<br><br>The Seamen's Registry Board is responsible for the

registration,  supply  and discipline  of  seamen,

while the Seafarers' Welfare Board looks after the

welfare  of retired, sick and disabled seamen  and

their  dependents and is also responsible for  the

training  of seamen. The Singapore Mariners'  Club

operates toe seamen's hostel at South Quay,  while

the  Singapore  Sailors' Institute until  recently

operated Connell House. Connell House reverted  to

Government in August last year, and its  clientele

are  now  using  the  faculties  provided  by  the

renovated  Singapore Mariners' Club, inc  Seamen's

Lodging-Houses Licensing Authority is  responsible

for  issuing licences to seamen's lodging  houses,

but  has been practically a moribund body for some

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above five authorities have historical

origins.  Circumstances have changed  considerably

over  the last decade and it would be more logical

to  amalgamate the five bodies into one  authority

to  be known as the National Maritime Board.  This

move  will  eliminate over-lapping  functions  and

will  result  in  more efficient organisation  and

administration of seafarers matters,  as  well  as

better  co-ordination  of  the  various  functions

presently performed the five different bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now summarise briefly the main

provisions of this Bill. The Board will consist of

nine members with representatives from Government.

ship-owners and seamen. Such a compact Board  will

be  able to perform its functions more effectively

than a large unwieldy board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the Board are to develop and

regulate maritime employment and to administer

welfare and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



training schemes. The Board will also advise  the

Minister  on  matters relating to  seafaring  and

such other related matters which the Minister may

refer to the Board for advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the proper administration of funds, there

is established a National Maritime Fund into which

all  moneys of the Board shall be paid. The moneys

in  the existing Singapore Mercantile Marine  Fund

shall  be  transferred  to The  National  Maritime

Fund.  The  Board  may, with the approval  of  the

Minister, Invest any surplus funds in such  stocks

and  securities and other investments  as  may  be

approved by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 is a re-enactment of the substance of

the  Seamen's  Registry Board Act  which  requires

shipowners  to engage seamen through the  Seamen's

Registry  Board  system. Clause  20  provides  for

penalties both for the employer and seamen in  the

event of breach of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is empowered, with the approval of the

Minister,   to  make  regulations.  These   powers

include  the power to prescribe the procedures  by

which  the  seamen may be selected for employment.

At  present, these procedures are spelt out in the

Seamen's  Registry Board Act itself, but when  the

National  Maritime Board Bill comes into force  it

is  proposed  that  such procedures  will  be  re-enacted by way of regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the National Maritime Board Act comes into

operation, the Seamen's Registry Board, Seafarers'

Welfare  Board, Singapore Mariners' Club,  Connell

House  Committee  and the Seamen's  Lodging-Houses

Licensing Authority shall cease to exist. However,

seamen  who  are  already  registered  under   the

Seamen's Registry Board Act shall be deemed to  be

registered under the National Maritime Board  Act.

The  existing staff of all these authorities shall

be  deemed to be transferred to the service of the

National   Maritime  Board  on  terms   not   less

favourable  than  those they  enjoyed  immediately

prior to their transfer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Members that

organisations  representing  shipowners,  namely,

the   Singapore  Shipping  Association  and   the

Singapore   Shipowners   Association,    maritime

employers  like the Singapore Maritime  Employers

Federation  as well as the National Trades  Union

Congress, have been consulted in tile drafting of

this  Bill  and many of their comments have  been

incorporated in this Bill. I take the opportunity

to  thank these organisations concerned for their

valuable comments and advice in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the shipping scene in

Singapore today is vastly different from what  it

was  ten  years  ago. Not only is  our  port  the

fourth  busiest in the world, but today  we  have

our  own  national  shipping  line,  the  Neptune

Orient Line. There are at present some 635  ships

totalling 893,779 gross tons registered under our

Singapore flag. We not only repair ships  but  we

can  also  build and sail them as well.  We  have

over  8,000 seamen on the register and  close  to

1,000 Singapore citizens serving as ship officers

and  engineers. All this progress in the shipping

field  has been achieved over the last ten years,

and  we are confident of yet greater progress  in

the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this progress there has arisen a need for

the  formation  of  a single  body  to  meet  the

requirements  of  the members of  the  mercantile

marine in a more efficient manner. Although  this

Bill  seeks  essentially to amalgamate  the  five

marine  statutory authorities into  one  National

Maritime  Board,  it  is  nevertheless   a   step

forward.    One   of   the   benefits   following

centralisation would he that the new Board  would

be  more capable of assessing the changing  needs

of  seafarers in the rapidly changing  technology

of  the shipping industry in Singapore and, where

necessary,   the   Board   could   recommend   to

Government areas for improvement and reform, once

it has settled down to its duties. I am confident

that  the  National Maritime Board, when  formed,

would  pursue vigorously its aims and  objectives

and thereby contribute to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



further  development  of  Singapore  as  a  great

shipping centre of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise in support of the National Maritime

Board Bill, but subject to such qualifications as

I  shall later on detail in my speech. The  topic

of  maritime  employment is  a  matter  of  great

interest  to  the NTUC which have  sponsored  the

formation   of  the  Singapore  Organisation   of

Seamen, a registered trade union to organise  and

represent  seamen in relation to their respective

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC, therefore, have reasons t' be

grateful  for  the  opportunity  to  give   their

comments  while  the Ministry  of  Communications

were in the process of drafting the Bill. Some of

the    recommendations   contained   in    NTUC's

memorandum  to the Ministry, I am  glad  to  say,

have  been incorporated into the Bill before  the

House. The accepted recommendations include those

dealing  with  the definitions of "seafarer"  and

"employer", and with the imposition of a  penalty

against    employers    engaging    seamen     in

contravention of the proposed Act. Other accepted

recommendations of NTUC dealt with minor matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the acceptance of some of their

recommendations, the NTUC have reservations about

the  Bill  as it now stands. While it is  natural

that  NTUC should feel disappointed that not  all

their  recommendations have  been  accepted,  the

reservations of NTUC are not founded  on  chagrin

but concern for the future of maritime employment

in our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second sentence of the Explanatory

Statement  to this Bill, it is averred that  "the

general  intention of the Bill is the welfare  of

members   of  the  mercantile  marine   and   the

development of the mercantile marine." In so  far

as  the  Bill  seeks to promote  the  welfare  of

seafarers,  it  does seem that  the  Bill  is  an

answer  to  the concern of the NTUC. But  therein

lies the snag.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in seeking to repeal the Seamen's

Registry  Board Act, the Seafarers' Welfare  Board

Act,  the  Singapore Mariners' Club  Act  and  the

Singapore    Sailors'   Institute    Incorporation

Ordinance and to re-enact the provisions of  these

four  statutes is, in effect, a consolidating Bill

without   any   new   provision   of   any   great

significance.  Other  than the  Seamen's  Registry

Board  Act,  the  other  three  statutes  are  not

concerned  with the matter of maritime employment.

And  under  the Seamen's Registry Board Act,  read

together  with the Seamen's Registry Board  Rules,

the  seamen  find  themselves  in  a  position  of

"Heads,  you  win: tails, I lose" vis-a-vis  their

employers,  for  that  accurately  describes   the

actual working of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law at present, and it will continue to

be  so  under  the Bill, a seaman who commits  any

misconduct  would,  in the absence  of  mitigating

circumstance,  be invariably meted out  with  some

form   of  disciplinary  action  by  the  existing

Seamen's  Registry Board or the proposed  Maritime

Board. The disciplinary action would usually be in

the  form of suspension from registration, or  the

loss  of priority in registration. As registration

is a condition precedent for the employment of any

seamen  of the registrable categories, it  can  be

easily imagined that such disciplinary action  has

a  sobering effect on, besides the financial shock

to,  the erring sailors. Such disciplinary  action

would have been bearable to the seamen if they can

be  sure  that the employers who literally  short-change their seamen would be brought to account in

a  similar fashion by the Board. Unfortunately,  a

seaman who has been granted less favourable  terms

than  those  originally  promised  to  him  cannot

expect any remedy from the Board, even though  the

representatives of his employer may be sitting  on

the  Board itself, for the simple reason that  the

Board  has  no  power to discipline the  employer.

What  utterly demoralises the seamen is  that  the

same employers' representatives, when disciplinary

action against seamen is called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



for,  would  have no scruples about demanding  the

imposition of the heaviest penalty on the seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for that reason, the NTUC happily places on

record the acceptance of their recommendations  by

the  Ministry to assure seamen the fruits of their

labour  by  including a definition of  "employer",

which is wide enough to cover the local agent of a

foreign  employer,  and  enabling  the  Board   to

regulate the manner of payment of salaries and the

discharge of contracts of service. The Ministry is

indeed to be congratulated for their inclusion  of

such  provisions which go towards  increasing  the

protection of seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to that extent the aim of the Ministry and

the aim of the NTUC seem to coincide. Beyond that,

their  aims  seem to be irreconcilably  divergent.

The  cause for such divergence seems to lie in the

fact  that  the Ministry approved the  Bill  as  a

consolidation  of  existing  provisions  with  the

incorporation  of new provisions  limited  to  the

barest  minimum possible. The NTUC views the  Bill

as an opportunity to eliminate malpractices by the

efficient  and  effective regulating  of  maritime

employment in Singapore. Thus, from the viewpoint,

the   Bill   must   necessarily  incorporate   new

provisions as the existing provisions of the  four

statutes to be repealed by and re-enacted  in  the

Bill  have  not  been adequate to deal  with  such

malpractices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that Members of this House can have a

proper   perspective  of  such   malpractices   in

relation  to maritime employment, it is  necessary

for  me  to  dwell at length on such malpractices.

More  important than the other major  question  of

assuring  seamen the fruits of their  labour,  for

which  the  Bill now contains provisions,  is  the

question  of  assuring seamen  a  fair  and  equal

opportunity  of employment. Thus, in  theory,  the

system  of  registration of certain categories  of

seamen  for  the  purpose of  maritime  employment

ensures  that seamen of the registrable categories

have   equal   opportunities  for  employment   by

requiring them to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



their  turn  in  the  queue  for  employment.   In

practice,   however,   Sir,   the   provision   as

reproduced  in  clause 6 (h) of the Bill  allowing

the Board to supervise the selection of seamen and

to  provide  both employers and seamen  reasonable

freedom  of  choice in relation to employment,  is

very  ineffective.  A  seaman  who  refuses  three

consecutive offers of employment goes down to  the

bottom  of  the  queue.  On  the  other  hand,  an

employer  who  refuses to select any  seamen  from

these  batches of seamen offered by the  Board  is

not similarly penalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am given to understand by the officials

of  the Singapore Organisation of Seamen that  the

greatest number of malpractices arises out of such

selection of seamen. It must be clearly emphasised

that  the rates of pay and other terms of  service

vary  greatly from shipping to shipping companies.

Naturally, there is a clamour among seamen to work

on,  for  instance, a Norwegian vessel where  they

can  earn double or treble the sum they may obtain

on,  for  instance, a Greek vessel  for  the  same

given  period of time. A Greek vessel, it  may  be

also  added,  is  the last recourse  of  desperate

seamen, for invariably a Greek vessel is literally

a floating jungle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to the point, seamen are prepared to

offer  up  to  one  month's wages,  which  can  be

substantial   on  a  Norwegian  vessel,   to   the

recruiting agents to ensure that they are taken on

by  such  a well-paying shipping company. That  is

where the abuse of the selection machinery of  the

Registry  Board comes in. If the seamen  who  have

offered  bribes  are not in the  first  or  second

batch  to be called up by the Board for selection,

the  recruiting agents who, I regret to  say,  are

also  Singapore  citizens, would  reject  all  the

seamen in the first two batches on one pretext  or

another.  Even  if  the seamen  who  have  offered

inducement are not sufficiently well up the  queue

to  be  included in the third and final  batch  of

seamen  to  be  called up by  the  Board  for  any

particular ship, the recruiting agents will make a

passionate  plea  for  the  employment  of   those

particular  seamen, or else they will  wait  until

almost departure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



time outside the office hours of the Board to take

on such seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the question of selection is a matter

of  life  and  death for the seamen because  every

additional  day  of  waiting for  selection  means

another  day without pay for themselves and  their

families.  The  point is how does  the  Government

intend to resolve the problem of ensuring that the

selection machinery offers every seamen  an  equal

opportunity  for employment? The  Police  and  the

Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau have  their

hands full with their existing responsibilities as

it is without having to look into the malpractices

in  maritime employment. A policy of "a  rate  for

the port" - that is, same pay and other conditions

of service for all seamen who sign on at Singapore

irrespective  of whichever ship they are  attached

to  -  is  not acceptable to the Ministry  as  not

being  feasible at present. I must  add  that  the

NTUC  agrees with the view of the Ministry on this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves us with the question of a manning

scale  as a means of eradicating the abuse of  the

selection machinery. By manning scale, I mean some

form  of  predetermined percentage of ratings,  or

registered  seamen, that must make up  any  ship's

complement.  I  am  given  to  understand  by  the

Singapore    Organisation    of    Seamen     that

representation has been made on this matter to the

Ministry.  In their representation, the  Singapore

Organisation  of  Seamen  have  also   drawn   the

attention  of the Ministry to the fact  that  some

ship's crew complements have been made up of  more

than  50  per  cent non-ratings or  non-registered

seamen.  Such  a situation has come about  through

the recruiting agents' rejection of all the seamen

offered  by  the Board under the normal  selection

process and hiring by the back-door, as it is,  of

persons  who are not trained as seamen or who  are

deregistered  or  suspended ratings  but  who  are

prepared   to   offer  some  inducement   to   the

recruiting  agents.  This  constitutes  the  other

principal abuse of the selection machinery of  the

Board, and it has more sinister implications.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, untrained or inexperienced

persons  who  are  taken  on  ships  normally   as

laundrymen,  hatch-men, or any other of  the  non-registrable categories, are not able to cope  with

the  natural  hazards or exigencies  that  can  be

expected  to occur to a ship at sea. The  risk  to

the  fare-paying passengers can well  be  imagined

since the non-registered seamen may not be able to

take care of themselves in a crisis at sea, not to

say  spare a thought for the passengers. It  is  a

matter  of  great importance that there should  be

some form of machinery for manning scale to ensure

that  every  ship  carries  a  minimum  number  of

trained seamen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For another thing, as long as ship-owners and

ship-captains  can  engage  non-registered  seamen

with  impunity,  the selection  machinery  of  the

Board will never achieve the purpose for which  it

is   intended,  and  that  is,  besides  being   a

machinery,   to   ensure  equal   opportunity   of

employment  with a disciplinary device  to  ensure

that  seamen  taken  on at Singapore  are  of  the

highest standards and so enhance the reputation of

Singapore by their work and conduct. It is obvious

that  seamen  who  are unruly and anti-social,  to

begin  with,  so  as  to  merit  the  disciplinary

sanction  of  the  Board, are unlikely  to  submit

themselves meekly to any suspension imposed by the

Board  on  them. It is such registered seamen  who

offer  themselves for employment by the back-door,

by-passing entirely the selection machinery of the

Board.  The  significance of the  absence  of  any

statutory  provision governing  manning  scale  in

relation  to the Board's objective of  seeking  to

regulate maritime employment is that it makes  for

unnecessary  difficulty in the attainment  of  the

Board's objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having given Members of the House a picture of

the background of this Bill, I now put forward the

following proposals for the consideration  of  the

Minister and the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is clearly intended as an enabling

instrument in that specific powers are exercisable

by the Board by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



way  of  the various regulations to be made  under

the   proposed  Act  with  the  approval  of   the

Minister. I see no harm in enhancing the  enabling

provision of the Bill so as to allow the Board  to

have  more  scope for action and  more  teeth  for

effectiveness  when  the  need  arises.  There  is

hardly  any danger of the Board running amok  with

its  powers, as the final say always lies with the

Minister. Sir, thus I suggest the inclusion of:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a provision for manning scale, on which I

have already spoken, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a provision under clause 21 of the Bill

conferring  on  the  Board "to prescribe  for  the

registration  of  all  persons  or  employees  who

desire to select or engage seamen registered under

the provisions of this Act".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing regulations provide for the

cancellation  of  registration  or  suspension  of

seamen against whom complaints have been lodged by

their  respective  employers.  But  there  is   no

reciprocal   provision   for   black-listing    or

penalising of employers who violate the  terms  of

contract  of  employment  of,  or  ill-treat,  the

seamen. Under the proposed provisions of clause 21

as it is, the amendment of the various regulations

as  indicated by this Bill would serve  no  useful

purpose, as far as seamen are concerned. It should

be also noted that under clause 20 of the Bill, no

distinction  is  made between  an  employer  or  a

seaman  in  respect of the penalty to be  incurred

for violation of the proposed Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various provisions in the Merchant Shipping

Act  (Cap. 172) dealing with employment of  seamen

should  be  deleted from the Act and  incorporated

into the proposed National Maritime Board Act or a

separate enactment by themselves. The Director  of

Marine   seems  most  unhappy  and  reluctant   to

exercise the various powers conferred on him under

the Merchant Shipping Act regarding employment  of

seamen. For instance, the provision of section  39

of  the Merchant Shipping Act stipulates that  the

engagement  of seamen for work in any ship,  whose

flag is not represented by a consular official  in

the Republic, shall be conducted in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



Mercantile  Marine Employment office  set  up  for

that purpose. The Director of Marine has indicated

to  the  Singapore Organisation of Seamen that  he

intends  to  propose amendments  to  the  Merchant

Shipping  Act  to relieve himself of such  onerous

responsibility as that entailed by the supervision

of the Mercantile Marine Employment office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only fair to inform the House that the

NTUC has never raised this point with the Ministry

when  representations were being made on the Bill.

The  fact is that, with discussions being confined

to  the  Bill,  it  seems rather awkward  to  make

references to another Act, which at that time  the

NTUC had the impression that it might come up  for

drastic  amendment as well. Now it is  clear  that

the Merchant Shipping Act would not be amended  in

relation  to maritime employment. I am also  given

to  understand that the Singapore Organisation  of

Seamen have made representation to the Ministry on

the inadvisability of the Director of Marine being

continued to be saddled with the responsibility of

supervising  maritime  employment.  Now  that  the

National  Maritime  Board is to  be  set  up,  the

opportunity  should  he taken  to  streamline  the

administration of maritime employment.



<br><br>6.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier on in

my  speech, I did mention that some organisations,

including the National Trades Union Congress, were

consulted  in  the drafting of this  Bill  and,  I

stress the word, many of their comments have  been

incorporated in this Bill. I was not in the  happy

position  to  say  that all their  recommendations

have  been incorporated. Probably the long  speech

by  the Member for Telok Blangah is in respect  of

those suggestions which have not been accepted. He

has  now narrated them to this House. If it is any

consolation to the Member for a very fluent speech

on  behalf  of  the NTUC, may I say that  quite  a

number of the recommendations from ship-owners  in

the  Singapore Employers' Federation were also not

accepted. Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



course,  in  the case of the workers, there  is  a

spokesman  in this House, but in the case  of  the

shipowners there does not seem to be any spokesman

to  plead their case. I want to say that we do not

claim  that  the National Maritime Board  Bill  is

perfect.  I  have stated that its main purpose  is

really to consolidate the five different statutory

bodies  which have been looking after the  affairs

of  mercantile marine, it is now felt  that  there

should be one central body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that it has taken as long as three

years for this central body to take place. I  have

mentioned  the  desirability of having  a  central

National Maritime Board as far back as 1968 when I

assumed  office. I visited the various bodies  and

it appeared to me that they were very disorganised

and  why should there be five different bodies  to

look after marine affairs. I, therefore, suggested

that  we  should create just one central body.  It

has  taken  three long years to do this.  This  is

only,  as  I  have  said,  a  step  in  the  right

direction.  It  is hoped that the reservations  of

the  NTUC will be resolved in due course of  time.

If  we  refer  to  the  Bill with  regard  to  the

constitution  of  the proposed  National  Maritime

Board,   we   will   see  that   there   will   be

opportunities for the NTUC to give full weight  to

their  reservations and fears, if any. There  will

be  a membership of nine members in the Board. The

Chairman,  who will be appointed by  the  Minister

will,  I hope, be a man of impartial standing  who

will  be  able  to  give us  the  benefit  of  his

experience  and  advice. Then there  will  be  the

Director  of  Marine  and the Director  of  Social

Welfare.  There  will be two persons  representing

shipowners  and  two persons representing  seamen.

Although there is no indication here that the NTUC

will be consulted, I can give my assurance here in

this  House  that it will be consulted before  the

two  representatives from the seamen are appointed

to the Board. There is no question at all that the

NTUC  will  not have a say in the conduct  of  the

affairs  of  the  Board. There will  also  be  two

public servants on the Board. Therefore,.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



we  have on the Board two representatives from the

shipowners,  two representatives from the  workers

and the four officials who when appointed will act

as   impartial  arbitrators  to  the   conflicting

requirements  of  the employers and  the  workers.

Above all, there will be an impartial chairman. As

I  have said, there is no question at all that the

workers'    views   will   not   be   given    due

consideration, and when the Board does come to any

conclusion, fairness will not only be apparent  to

the  workers but also to the employers. We  cannot

have  everything to the advantage of the  workers,

otherwise the employers will just fold up and then

there will be no ships to employ the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has mentioned the situation in which

the  seamen are placed, "Heads, you win; tails,  I

lose."  I  wish to assure him that this  will  not

happen as long as it is a fair proposition and  if

the  Board makes suitable recommendations. As  the

Minister  for Communications, I will be  only  too

happy  to  accept the Board's recommendations.  As

for  the  various malpractices, I would appreciate

it  if the representatives of workers on the Board

could  give  the  Board  sufficient  evidence  and

specific  information for it to act on. There  may

be  backdoor selections which would be contrary to

the  law,  in  which  case I  am  sure  that  with

adequate  evidence to follow up our very efficient

Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau - I do know

that  they have a lot of work to do, but  I  still

think  it is necessary for sufficient evidence  to

be  made  available to the C.P.I.B, for  them  to

follow  up  -  will take the necessary  action  to

reduce, if not eliminate, all these malpractices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has conceded that

his  proposed legislation is new and  which  would

require an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act.

It is the manning scales proposed by the Singapore

Organisation  of Seamen. May I suggest  that  this

matter be referred to the National Maritime  Board

when it is set up, and probably this matter can be

the  very first item on its agenda. It can all  be

thrashed out by the Board then. And if it  is  the

majority view of the Board -. I would not use  the

word "unanimous" -that these suggestions should be

accepted,  I shall be very happy to come  back  to

this House to make various amendments to this  Act

so   that  it  can  be  a  much  better  piece  of

legislation  to improve the working conditions  of

our  seamen and for the general prosperity of  the

shipping   community.  I  hope  the   Member   is

satisfied  with  my answer to his  long  and  able

speech  which,  I am sure, will be  given  serious

consideration  by the new National Maritime  Board

when it is formed.
