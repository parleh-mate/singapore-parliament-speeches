<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Amendment  [21st  November, 1961] to  Question  [20th

November, 1961],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it has always been the avowed

objective  of all nationalists of Malaya  to  achieve

the reunification of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya  and to remove the artificial division created

by  the British by their policy of "divide and rule",

this  House  affirms  and  declares  that  the  first

objective  of  all  true patriots  of  Malaya  is  to

achieve the reunification of these two territories in

a   merger  of  Singapore  with  the  Federation   of

Malaya."-(The Minister for Labour-Inche  Ahmad  bin

Ibrahim).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To leave out from "a" in the second last line to

the end and insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation as the

twelfth state and with all its Citizens automatically

becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day".'-(Dr Lee Siew Choh).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on

Friday  I  was saying that the Barisan Sosialis  were

first  asking  for full and complete  merger  on  the

basis  of Penang and Malacca. But now, when they  are

told



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



that  complete merger on that basis will  not  enable

all  Singapore  citizens to become Federal  citizens,

they  do  not mention any more of Penang and  Malacca

but  ask  for  automatic conversion of all  Singapore

citizens into Federal citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister has already said that it is

unreasonable for us to put up such demands.  I  would

like  to show an example to the Barisan Sosialis  how

it is unreasonable. Suppose two brothers came from  a

Commonwealth country to Malaya in 1955.  One  brother

settled  in  Singapore. The other brother settled  in

Johore  Bahru.  In  1957, Singapore citizenship  laws

came  into  being. In 1957 the brother in  Singapore,

who  had  already lived in Singapore for  two  years,

became a Singapore citizen. Now, on the Barisan  type

of  merger, he would become a Federal citizen on  the

attainment  of merger. But the brother  who  came  to

Johore Bahru at the same time as his counterpart came

to  Singapore, and who had lived the same  number  of

years  would not be able to become a Federal citizen.

But  the  brother in Singapore would become a Federal

citizen. Is this reasonable or unreasonable? Let  the

Barisan  Sosialis say it. Is it not  unreasonable  to

grant  citizenship to one man and refuse  it  to  the

other when both have the same qualifications?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was alleged by the Members for

Queenstown and Changi that after merger on the  terms

set  out in the White Paper, Singapore citizens  will

become  second-class  citizens.  In  what  way   will

Singapore  citizens become second-class citizens?  It

is  no  use one speaker after another repeating  this

falsehood  without showing how the Singapore  citizen

will become a second-class citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason the Barisan Sosialis have put

forward  is  that Singapore citizens cannot  vote  or

stand  for election to the Federal Parliament in  the

Federation.  Federal  citizens also  cannot  vote  or

stand  for  election  to  the Federal  Parliament  in

Singapore.  Why then is one citizen inferior  to  the

other?  If they say the Singapore citizen is  second-class,  it can also be said that the Federal  citizen

is also second-class.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Minister for Culture has dealt with

this point, but even after the Minister's speech, the

Barisan  Sosialis  keep  on repeating  the  unfounded

allegation  that Singapore citizens are second-class,

so  that they hope that if this is repeated again and

again  by all their 13 Members and published  in  the

Press,  people  who  read  it  can  be  misled   into

believing what they say is true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi said citizenship was a

fundamental right of the people. Who says it is  not?

He  says after the merger proposed in the White Paper

this  right will be taken away. How will it be  taken

away?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also said on 21st

November  (Straits Times, 22nd November), "It  means,

in  the first place, that if a Singapore citizen goes

to  the Federation after the P.A.P. phoney merger, he

will  become disenfranchised and will not be  allowed

to  vote or to stand for election in the Federation."

What a deliberate falsehood. Even now, if a Singapore

citizen goes to the Federation, he will not lose  his

Singapore citizenship. Is it anywhere stated that  he

will lose his Singapore citizenship right, if he goes

to  the Federation after merger? All these deliberate

falsehoods  are  uttered to mislead  the  people  and

mobilise agitation for merger. It is true that  if  a

Singapore citizen goes to the Federation, he will not

be  allowed  to  vote or stand for  election  in  the

Federation,  but  he  will never lose  his  Singapore

citizenship    rights.    He    will    not    become

disenfranchised.  If  a Singapore  citizen  wants  to

become a Federal citizen, that is a different matter.

In  the  same  way,  if a Federal  citizen  comes  to

Singapore and wants to become a Singapore citizen, he

has to apply for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis' main object is nothing but to

oppose  merger.  That is why they  allege  all  these

falsehoods,  so  that  they can  get  the  people  to

believe that the people are losing their rights.  You

will  see, Mr Speaker, Sir, from what I am going  to

state,  how  insincere, vicious and mischievous  they

are in their utterances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi on Friday said that by the

White  Paper proposals, Singapore citizens,  if  they

want to stand for election, have to have a knowledge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



of  English  or  Malay, after merger,  or  else  they

cannot  stand for election. This is true only to  the

extent  of  Federal  Parliament  elections.  But  the

Member  went on to say that now, knowledge of Chinese

is  sufficient,  but after the P.A.P. merger, people

who  know  only Chinese cannot stand for election  to

the  Federal Parliament. He said so, Sir. It  is  not

reported in the Straits Times, but it might have been

reported  in  the  Chinese Press. What  is  the  real

intention of this allegation? The intention is to say

that  the  P.A.P. is taking away the  right  of  the

Chinese-educated to stand for election. Now, let  the

Barisan  Sosialis tell us, according to the  complete

merger  they are asking for, can a man who  does  not

know English or Malay stand for Federal election?  At

least, with autonomy in Singapore's domestic affairs,

according to the White Paper proposals, there will be

a  multilingual Singapore Legislature.  If  it  is  a

complete  merger,  there will not be  a  multilingual

Singapore   Legislature.  They  will  have   only   a

bilingual  Legislative  Assembly  or  Council  as  in

Penang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown on 20th November, talked

about  what  citizenship  means  and  what  are   the

benefits  the citizen will get, besides the right  to

vote.  It  is  also true that only citizens  can  get

permanent employment in Government; only citizens can

be  given  land for resettlement; only  citizens  can

apply  for Housing and Development Board flats;  only

citizens  can  get  legal aid and public  assistance;

only  citizens are given passports; and only citizens

cannot  be banished. He also said that only  children

of citizens are given preference to others in schools

and  in  getting scholarships. Thus, he  was  telling

this House of the importance of citizenship. Then  he

went  on  to say, "If merger is to have any  meaning,

then Singapore citizens must become Federal citizens.

Only   then   will   Singapore  citizens   have   the

opportunity of sharing all these benefits."  He  then

suggested that if a Singapore citizen does not become

a  Federal citizen, he will lose all his rights.  How

will  a Singapore citizen Jose all his rights  if  he

does not become a Federal citizen? He never said how.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Singapore citizens be refused employment in

the  Government service? Will they be refused  public

assistance and legal aid'? Will they not get  Housing

and  Development flats? He did not quote  one  single

instance of how Singapore citizens will lose  any  of

these  rights if they do not become Federal  citizens

after  merger. He calls the proposals  in  the  White

Paper a betrayal, treachery, sell-out, phoney merger,

and  so  on.  Even  the Member for Anson - though  he

supports  the  amendment  for various  reasons - admits

that the proposals are the best in the circumstances.

He  even complimented, Sir. The only thing he said is

that it is not a merger. But the Barisan Sosialis say

that all this is a sell-out and they call for general

elections.  They ask us to resign. I  would  like  to

tell  the Members of the Barisan Sosialis once  again

that they were elected to this Assembly on the P.A.P.

ticket  and that they had pledged to resign  if  they

were  ever expelled. Let them honour their word. They

cannot  just say that they represent the  public  and

that the people are with them. If they really want to

know whether the public are with them in their demand

for  a  complete  merger with  autonomy  in  domestic

affairs,  such as education, social welfare,  labour,

trade, and so on, they should resign their seats  and

prove their support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Member for Changi said the other

day - though  it was not reported in the Straits  Times - that  they  were elected not because  of  the  P.A.P.

leaders  but because of the socialists in the Barisan

Sosialis who were then in the P.A.P. Except  for  the

Members   for  Thomson,  Havelock,  Toa   Payoh   and

Moulmein,  none  of  the  present  Barisan   Sosialis

Assemblymen were ever heard of before 1959.  At  that

time,  the present important non-Assemblymen  leaders

of the Barisan Sosialis were in prison. I stress that

they  were elected on the record of the P.A.P. under

the  present  leadership and not on any other  thing.

Those who do not honour their word stabbed us in  the

back  at the time of a crucial by-election and helped

an  opponent to win his election. It is too  much  to

expect of them, Sir!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis talk of complete merger in

this  House. But what do they do outside? Their  rank

and  file and their agents go to the ordinary  people

and  propagate that if there is merger the people  of

Singapore will have to wear sarongs, songkoks, accept

Islam   as  their  religion,  Malay  as  their   only

language,  and  so on, thus frightening  the  people.

Even  this  morning,  Sir, their  people  were  going

around  in  front of my house and putting up  posters

all  over  the place agitating for this 4:2 education

system. These are the people who say that the  people

will  accept  the Federation's education  policy.  Is

this the way they are going to persuade the people of

Singapore  to  accept the Federation's education  and

labour policies in a complete merger?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> On a point of order.

What is the basis for these allegations?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. That is a

point of argument.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Read

the Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> On 23rd November, the Member for

Changi said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the State today, the masses were openly decrying

the  P.A.P.  Government. In coffee-shops and  hawker-stalls,  the  people  were  highly  critical  of  the

Government.'



<br><br>It  is not true. It is these Barisan Sosialis men who

talk  of one thing in this House and then go  to  the

people  to  instigate them with  all  sorts  of  lies

against merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Straits Times!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the word

"lies"  was  used with reference to Members  of  this

Assembly.  If  it  was,  then the  hon.  Member  must

withdraw the word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I was mentioning the agents who

work.  It  is  not true that the people do  not  like

merger  as proposed in the White Paper. It  is  these

Barisan  Sosialis men who tell the people  falsehoods

about  citizenship, education and labour, and try  to

confuse  them  and  arouse their emotional  feelings.

Even in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



this House the Member for Queenstown (the Chairman of

the  Barisan Sosialis) asked a lot of questions. What

is  the  purpose of asking these questions when  they

know full well that the people will be better off and

they  will have nothing to complain about in a merger

as  proposed in the White Paper than in a  merger  as

proposed  by the Barisan Sosialis'? Their purpose  is

to  create  an impression in the minds of the  people

that   they   will  suffer  under  the  White   Paper

proposals.  When the Minister for Culture was  saying

the  same  thing, the Member for Havelock  asked  the

Minister  to  answer them as though the answers  will

show the people that they will suffer. T shall answer

the  questions,  Sir. Let them see in  what  way  the

people  will  suffer  because  of  the  merger.   The

questions  are in the Straits Times of 22nd  November

in a speech made by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 1 reads: "What would the civil

servants  gain  with  merger'? Would  they  get  more

opportunities for promotion in a wider service  under

the  same terms existing or under better terms? Would

promotion  be  accelerated?"  If  there  is  complete

merger -   as   proposed  by  the  Barisan   Sosialis -recruitment into the civil service will be in the  4:

1  ratio as in the Federation. But according  to  the

White  Paper proposals, Singapore citizens will  have

equal  rights and opportunities for recruitment.  The

Member  for Anson came to their rescue and  tried  to

tell  us  that this will not affect us as this  ratio

relates  only to the Federal service and not  to  the

State  service. The Deputy Prime Minister has cleared

this  point by pointing out the departments that will

be left in the State service after merger. Except for

the  Land Office, no other big department will be  in

the  State service. Therefore, in a complete  merger,

the majority of the civil servants will be affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions 2 and 3 read: "Would bus companies be

allowed  to  operate  freely on  new  routes  in  the

Federation? Would they be treated equally as  others?

Would  contractors  get  the same  opportunities  for

business in the Federation as in Singapore?" The same

argument as for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



the  civil  service will apply to these  questions

also.  Bus companies in Singapore will have  their

present  rights  in Singapore in the  White  Paper

proposals.  But  in a complete  merger,  the  same

practice  in the Federation will have to apply  to

Singapore  bus companies also. Which will  benefit

them  more - complete merger or merger with autonomy

in domestic affairs? Contractors who are Singapore

citizens  will  have preference over  the  Federal

citizens  in  getting jobs in  Singapore.  Federal

citizens will get preference in the Federation. In

a complete merger, certain type of contracts, even

in Singapore, will have to be given to Malays. Let

the  Barisan  Sosialis remember that  there  is  a

policy in the Federation by which certain types of

contracts  are to he given only to the  indigenous

people of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 4 reads: "Would Singapore citizens

be  able to apply for jobs in the Federation after

merger?   Would  they  be  discriminated   against

because  they are not Federal citizens?" Even  now

Singapore citizens are able to apply for  jobs  in

both  territories. Federal citizens are also  able

to  apply for jobs in both territories. Preference

may   be  given  to  Singapore  citizens  in   the

Singapore  Government and to Federal  citizens  in

the Federal Government. After merger, arrangements

will  be made to all Federal nationals to be given

preference in both territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 5 reads: "Would the products of

Singapore  schools and universities he allowed  to

apply  for jobs in the Federation?" Here  at  the

present moment, there is no denial of this  right.

I do not know why the Member for Queenstown thinks

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions 6 and 7 ask whether all Singapore

citizens would accept the security risk of  moving

about  freely  in the Federation. Except  for  the

people  who  will try to undermine the  democratic

Government in the Federation, all people  will  be

allowed to move about freely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 8 reads: "Would students from

Singapore  schools  and  universities - particularly

Nanyang  University - have  the  right  to   travel

freely in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation?"  If there is to  be  a  complete

merger without autonomy in domestic affairs, there

may   not  be  Nanyang  University  and  no  such

question would then arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions 9, 10, 11 and 12 - all the same reply,

Sir.   When  there  is  autonomy  in  labour  with

different  labour  laws  in  the  Federation   and

Singapore, it is only natural that there  will  be

separate  bodies of trade unions. But if there  is

to  be a complete merger, are the Barisan Sosialis

prepared to accept the same labour laws as in  the

Federation?  Let them say clearly that  they  will

accept  the  Federation's  education  policy,  the

Rahman  Talib Report on Education, and so on.  The

Barisan  Sosialis also know, of course, that  non-Federal  citizens  cannot  hold  office   in   any

territory in the Federation. Non-Federal  citizens

will  not  be  made leaders as in Singapore  after

merger, if it is going to be a complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About businessmen, they ask, "Will they have

equal  opportunities?" Even  now  businessmen  are

enjoying   equal  opportunities.   There   is   no

inequality   in  the  rights  of  businessmen   in

Singapore  and  the  Federation.  What  make   the

Barisan  Sosialis  think  that  there  will  be  a

difference after merger? I do not know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Mr Speaker, these questions

are  put  only to confuse the people and leave  an

impression that the people will lose their  rights

after merger, thus getting them to oppose merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has been repeating the

same  thing - unequal rights. Where are the  unequal

rights?  In what way are the citizens of  the  two

territories  unequal?  Let  them  point  out   one

instance. And without any substantiation, all this

propaganda will only mean that they are opposed to

merger. And they are putting up these unreasonable

demands and obstacles only to sabotage merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before ending my speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, let

me  deal with certain points raised by the  Member

for Anson who unfortunately is not in this Chamber

at the moment. On the question of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



equal   treatment  for  all  the  four   streams   of

education,  he  admitted that  there  was  a  radical

divergence in the Federation education policy, and if

the  people  of Singapore did not wish to  perpetuate

this  difference, a Federal Act could easily  provide

for   the  maintenance  and  administration  of   the

existing  education  policy in Singapore.  What  does

this  mean?  This  means that he  wants  a  different

education  policy for Singapore. Instead of  mingling

words   and  misleading  the  people,  can   he   not

acknowledge  that this is what the  P.A.P. wants  by

retaining  autonomy  in education?  He  said  that  a

Federal  Act  could easily be passed. Of  course,  he

knows - he is a renowned lawyer - as well as we do,  that

to  do this, there should be a majority of Members of

Parliament  to agree to any enactment of any  Act  or

law. Suppose after merger we do not get a majority to

agree  to  pass  this Act. What will happen?  Is  the

Member  for  Anson prepared to forget  about  it?  He

personally may. Will the people of Singapore agree to

this?  That  is why we ask for autonomy in  education

beforehand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for labour also, the Member for Anson said,

"Even  if  Singapore had full labour legislation  and

policies,  there was nothing to prevent  the  Federal

Government authorising the State Government  here  to

exercise  responsibility in this  field."  What  does

this  also  mean?  Does  this not  mean  autonomy  in

labour?  He says, "Let us have complete merger",  and

then says, "Let the State Government be authorised to

exercise  responsibility in this field." Why  has  he

got  to  mislead  the people in this way  instead  of

accepting autonomy on labour, education, and  so  on?

He  might as well say, "Let us have complete  merger,

and   then   pass  Acts  in  the  Federal  Parliament

providing   the  Singapore  Government  to   exercise

responsibility  in internal security  as  well."  Why

stop at that? Pass Acts in the Federal Parliament  to

transfer full responsibility for defence and external

affairs of the whole of the Federation of Malaya  and

Singapore  to the Singapore Legislature so  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis  can change the foreign  policy  of

Malaya to suit them. Then the Member for Anson and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



his  friends  in the Barisan Sosialis will  be  very,

very happy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Anson wanted to know for a

fact  the  number  of  Communists  in  Singapore  and

whether  there are really so many Communists in  this

State. I would like to remind him of his days in  the

year  1956  when he was Chief Minister of  Singapore,

and  when  there  were the Hock  Lee  riots,  and  he

introduced   the  Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance  to  replace the Emergency Regulations.  If

there  were no Communists in this State, why  did  he

introduce   the   Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance? Has he forgotten the Hock Lee riots? Who

instigated those riots? Who were behind them? Are the

very  same people not living amongst us, or have they

disappeared? This is one instance, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance. After the Tanjong Pagar and

Cairnhill  by-elections in 1957, the  present  Member

for Anson said that he had retired from politics. And

at the end of 1957 the Workers' Party was formed with

Mr  Chang Yuen Thong as Vice-Chairman. The  Workers'

Party  won  three  out  of four  seats  in  the  City

council, and with an overwhelming majority. Then,  as

we  were  told by the Prime Minister in  one  of  his

talks over Radio Singapore, Chang Yuen Thong resigned

from  the  Workers' Party and the City Council.  When

Chang Yuen Thong resigned, there was a by-election in

Kallang.  The Workers' Party candidate who contested.

the Kallang by-election got only 300 odd votes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Member help the Chair

by  indicating how this is relevant to the motion? Is

it relevant to Communism?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson

asked the other day whether there were Communists  or

whether there were too many Communists in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have asked the Member to

explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I am only trying to explain that there

are Communists in Singapore at the moment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, I understand that. But have these

by-elections anything to do with Communism?  I  really

do not understand that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I am going to prove that. Sir. They

contested   the  elections  and  won  an  overwhelming

majority in December 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Point of order, Mr

Speaker, Sir, if I may. Mr Speaker, is it not a point

of  order where the Member misrepresents completely  a

statement made in this House? If it is not,  then  it

is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. But, of

course,  the hon. Member will have his opportunity  if

he  has been misunderstood or misrepresented. There is

a  Standing  Order  which enables the  Member  or  any

Member  to correct the misunderstanding, and  that  is

Standing Order 43, paragraph (4) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Member who has spoken to a question may again he

heard to offer an explanation of some material part of

his  speech which has been misunderstood; hut he shall

not introduce any new matter.'



<br><br>If  the hon. Member feels he has been misunderstood in

a  material  part of his speech. then  he  may  speak

again after the Parliamentary Secretary has ceased  to

speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1958 Chang Yuen

Thong resigned from the Workers' Party, as told to  us

by  the Prime Minister in one of his talks. He met the

"Plen", and the Plen said he would instruct Chang Yuen

Thong  to resign from the Workers' Party and the  City

Council.  And  it was carried out. I  am  just  saying

these things to prove that the events related to us by

the  Prime  Minister are all true, and that there  are

Communists in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party candidate who contested the

Kallang by-election got only 300-odd votes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the inference, therefore, that

those  who  did not vote for the Workers'  Party  were

Communists?   Is   that  what  the  hon.   Member   is

indicating?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> What I am saying is that in 1957

Communists  infiltrated into the  Workers'  Party  and

they  helped  the Workers' Party to  win  in  so  many

elections with an overwhelming majority. In 1958  they

deserted  the  Workers' Party and  that  was  why  the

candidate  who  stood for election  got  only  300-odd

votes. That is what I am trying to explain, Sir. Where

had  all  the support for the Workers' Party  in  1957

gone,  111 1958? How does the Member for Anson explain

the  sudden  rise  and fall of the Workers'  Party  in

those  years?  If he does not agree  with  the  Prime

Minister's  version of the events  which  led  to  the

resignation of Chang Yuen Thong, how does  he  explain

it?  Do  not  all these facts prove the  existence  of

Communists in this State?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Who said this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Lastly, may I end this speech by asking

the Barisan Sosialis on the Opposition Benches to take

note  of  all  these events? Think of  the  future  of

Singapore.   If  they  want  a  real  unification   of

Singapore  and the Federation, do not call the  people

of the Federation of Malaya Manchurians and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Point of explanation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way. He has not

given way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Take the White Paper proposals as a

first   step   towards  the  reunification   of   both

territories.  Therefore, I say to this House  that  we

should reject this amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> A personal explanation, Sir, under the

Standing Order you have referred to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is once

again  late.  Under Standing Order 10,  paragraph  (1)

(n),  personal  explanations, if  any,  must  be  made

before  Public  business, and we  are  now  on  Public

business.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

despite the fact that we have been debating this

vital issue of merger for more than five days, we

have people who are as confused as ever in the maze

of arguments, counter arguments, and counter-counter

arguments, as what we have the counterpart in power

politics, the development of missiles, anti-missiles,

and anti-anti-missiles. In my speech, therefore, as

far as I can, I am avoiding reference to the legal

technicalities of the Federation Constitution, or

making quotations from it. I will also try to refrain

from delving into the details of the White Paper at

this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there has been so much confusion on this

subject  of merger, I think it is important  that  we

should  discuss the issue dispassionately and without

personal   rancour   or  bitterness.   Electioneering

techniques or mass meeting techniques will  not  help

us  to clarify the issue. There have been doubts  and

confusion on this issue. Sir, the confusion has  been

partly due to the introduction of personalities  into

this  subject and the petty squabbles during the past

few months. All along we have remained silent because

we  do  not  want  to  be  involved  in  these  petty

squabbles. The doubts have been due mainly to the way

the  Government brought forward its so-called  merger

proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that the Government

rejected  merger talks with the Federation when  they

were  requested to do so in one of the  16  Hong  Lim

Resolutions. As far as I can see, it was  only  after

the   Hong   Lim  by-election  that  the   Government

commenced constitutional talks with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are broadly three types of views on

merger.  Firstly,  there are those  who  support  the

principle  of  complete merger. Secondly,  there  are

those  who  accept  the proposal  of  the  Government

for - for want of a better name - I will call a tiga suku

merger.  In the third group are those who are opposed

to  any  form of association with the Federation.  We

can now ignore this third



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



group,  because, for obvious reasons, nobody in  this

third  group dares to come out openly to say that  he

is opposed to merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been many interpretations of what

is  complete merger. What is complete merger?  If  we

have  complete merger, if Singapore accepts  complete

merger,  we  would he like the State of  Johore.  All

Singapore citizens could become Federal citizens.  We

could  vote about 21 candidates, as the Minister  for

Health  and Law has calculated - and this we  will  not

argue  or  dispute  at  the  moment - to  the  Federal

Parliament. This figure of 21 can be worked out later

whether  it  is  correct or not.  Now,  if  there  is

complete merger, we would have, at the same  time,  a

Singapore  State Government, like the present  Johore

State  Government,  with  a  Chief  Minister  and  an

Executive Council. What are the powers of the present

State  Government  in Johore? They have  jurisdiction

over the following subjects:





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Muslim law;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Land matters;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Agriculture and forestry;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Local Government;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Other services of a local character like fire-brigade, burial grounds and markets;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) State public works and water supply;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Machinery of the State Government and a few other minor and unimportant subjects.



<br><br>In  other words, if we have complete merger, the

Singapore    State   Government    would    have

jurisdiction   in   land   matters   and   local

government. The other subject matters are of not

much importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Johore State Government has also

concurrent jurisdiction over matters

like social welfare, parks, hawkers,

public health, drainage and a few other

minor subjects. By concurrent jurisdiction, we

mean that the State Government

has jurisdiction, at the pleasure, more

or less, of the Federation Government.

In short, under complete merger, all

Singapore citizens would become Federal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



citizens,  electing about 21 representatives  to

the Federal Parliament, and also representatives

to  a  Singapore State Assembly, which will form

the  Singapore  State  Government.  The  Federal

Parliament  would  have  much  power   and   the

Singapore State Assembly would have very  little

power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been arguments on all sides

about  what  is complete merger. I  say  to  all

Members  who do not understand what is  complete

merger,  that the best thing is either to  cross

the  Causeway and stay in Johore Bahru for a few

days, or ask Federal citizens what it is like to

live  as a Federal citizen in Johore Bahru - what

are his rights, duties, and obligations, and how

does the Johore State Government work?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the P.A.P. proposed merger.

This  is  what we say a tiga suku merger.  These

are  constitutional proposals put forward by the

Singapore Government in White Paper No. Cmd.  33

of  1961. Under this scheme, there would be  two

distinct    types   of   citizenship,    Federal

citizenship  and Singapore citizenship.  Federal

citizens who come and live in Singapore  do  not

enjoy  the  rights and privileges nor share  the

obligations  of  Singapore citizens.  Similarly,

Singapore  citizens  who  go  and  live  in  the

Federation  would  not  enjoy  the  rights   and

privileges  of  Federal citizens nor  share  the

obligations of Federal citizens. The  two  types

of citizenship are quite distinct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal citizens voting in the Federation in

their  capacity as Federal nationals,  that  is,

according to the State Advocate-General's latest

explanation,     could    send     about     100

representatives    to   the   Central    Federal

Parliament.   Singapore   citizens   voting   in

Singapore,   in   their  capacity   as   Federal

nationals, could send 15 representatives to this

same  Central  Federal Parliament. The  majority

Party  in this Central Federal Parliament  could

form the Central Government. If Federal citizens

come and live and work in Singapore, they cannot

stand  as candidates; neither can they vote  for

candidates to this Federal Parliament.  Nor  can

they  exercise the right to vote for  candidates

in the Singapore State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



Assembly.  In other words, Federal citizens  who

come  and live in Singapore would have no  right

to  vote in Singapore. If Singapore citizens  go

and live in the Federation, they cannot vote for

any candidate nor stand for Federal election. In

other  words, Singapore citizens have  only  the

right  to vote in Singapore and Federal citizens

have only the right to vote in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the P.A.P. proposals, Singapore citizens

would  not  become Federal citizens.  They  can

only  vote  in  Singapore for 15 seats  in  the

Federal  Parliament.  The Singapore  Government

would  still be elected by Singapore  citizens.

This Singapore Government, as envisaged in  the

White  Paper, would have more powers  than  the

Johore  State Government, which comes  under  a

complete  merger.  The additional  jurisdiction

which  would be given to Singapore in the State

List,   that  is,  exclusively  for   Singapore

jurisdiction, are labour and welfare, education

and   health.  And  the  additional  concurrent

jurisdiction  would be - I will only  relate  the

more important ones, Mr Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Banking and loans and borrowing by the

State;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Imports and exports, production of goods and

insurance;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Industry and regulation of industrial

undertakings;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Shipping;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Newspapers, publications, publishers,

printing and printing presses;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Administration and day-today programmes of

Radio  Singapore and television; the policy  on

broadcasting and television would be controlled

by the Federal Government;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Censorship, theatres and cinemas;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) A few other minor unimportant subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a tiga suku merger, the Singapore

State  Government  would thus  have  some  more

powers compared to the Johore State Government.

I am bringing Johore as a comparison because it

is  nearest  to  Singapore. The  P.A.P.  Government's  contention  is that,  under  the  White

Paper, the Singapore State Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



would  have  more  powers than any  other  State

Governments in the Federation, like Johore. This

I  do  not think we can deny. Therefore, as  the

P.A.P.   Government   contends,   in   exchange,

Singapore should accept 15 seats instead  of  21

seats in the Federal Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government further does not agree

that all Singapore citizens can be qualified  to

become   Federal  citizens  under  the   present

Federation   citizenship  laws  and,  therefore,

there  should  be two types of citizenship,  one

voting  in  Singapore  and  one  voting  in  the

Federation,  and  both voting  for  the  Central

Parliament in their respective territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not regard the P.A.P. Government's

formula  as a genuine merger. It is like joining

a  club  as an associate member. This  club  has

ordinary members like Johore, and it would  like

to  recruit associate members, as what is  being

proposed in the White Paper, like Singapore.  Of

course,  my Party prefers that Singapore  should

join  as  an  ordinary  member  and  not  as  an

associate member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government has repeatedly said

that  it  does not want Singapore  to  join  the

Federation as an ordinary member. It is prepared

to  admit  the  Borneo territories  as  ordinary

members. But it would admit Singapore only as  a

partner, which I will call an associate  member.

There  would  thus be a distinction between  the

admission of Singapore and the admission of  the

three Borneo States. According to the plan which

has  been  announced, sovereignty over Singapore

would  be  transferred from the British  to  the

Federation. In other words, instead of,  at  the

moment,  the  British being the sovereign  power

over Singapore, sovereignty would be transferred

to  the  Federation Parliament. Under the  White

Paper, citizens of Singapore and citizens of the

Federation would be called Federation nationals.

I think it will be confusing if we start arguing

over  the  meanings of "national"  and  "citizenship".  It  is best to dispense with and  forget

about  the words "Federal nationals".  The  word

"citizenship"   and  the  word  "national"   are

interchangeable, and the important thing to find

in   each  of  these  phrases  is  what  rights,

privileges  and, obligations are  attached?  To

show how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



confusing  it would be Sir, a citizen of  Johore

is  called  a  Johore national. He is  a  Johore

national;  he  is a Federal citizen;  under  the

proposed  set-up he would be a Federal  national

and  he  is also a Commonwealth citizen.  Johore

national, Federal citizen, Commonwealth citizen,

Federal national. He would have four status. But

the  other three status do not mean much  except

the  status  of  being  a Federal  citizen.  The

rights, privileges and duties, as I have stated,

of  a  Johore national derive from the fact that

he  is a Federal citizen and not so much because

he  is a Johore national, a Federal National, or

a Commonwealth citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Singapore citizens are concerned,

the  only  benefit, as I can see  from  being  a

Federal  national, is that instead of a  British

passport,  one  gets a Federation  passport.  In

other  words,  there would be no actual  benefit

from  this  new  concept of a Federal  national.

Therefore,  it  is best for argument's  sake  to

leave out this concept of Federal national.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have the pros and cons of a genuine

merger  vis-a-vis  a  tiga-suku  merger.  In   a

genuine  merger,  we would be like  the  present

Federal  citizens living, say,  in  Johore.  The

Singapore  Government,  in  a  complete  merger,

would   be   like  the  present   Johore   State

Government  with very limited powers.  We  would

vote  21  representatives into the  Federal  Parliament. If we move and live in any State of the

Federation, we would also have the right to vote

and   to  stand  for  election  to  the  Federal, Parliament or for any State Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This movement of citizens to the other

territory  is  only  put  up  for  the  sake  of

explanation, because we would not expect a great

wave of emigration of people from Singapore into

the Federation or from the Federation into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the "tiga-suku" merger. What

are the pros and cons in the "tiga-suku" merger?

In  the "tiga-suku" merger, the Singapore  State

Government would have slightly more powers  than

the present Johore State Government. I have just

enumerated    those   powers   and    additional

jurisdiction. But there will be two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



distinct  types of citizenship. Federal citizens

can  only  vote in the Federation and  Singapore

citizens  can  only vote in Singapore.  Both  of

them  vote  for representatives to a common  and

central   Federal   Parliament.   Only   Federal

citizens  can  enjoy  the  benefits  of  Federal

citizenship  in the territory of the Federation.

if  they  come  to  Singapore, they  lose  their

rights.  Only Singapore citizens can  enjoy  the

benefits  of Singapore citizenship in Singapore.

If  they  go to the Federation, they  will  also

similarly lose their rights. Singapore citizens,

voting  in  Singapore in the "tiga-suku"  merger

will  send  15  representatives to  the  Central

Parliament.  These are the pros and  cons  of  a

genuine merger and the "tiga-suku" merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party, the United People's Party,

stands  for complete and genuine merger  because

the  long-term  advantages of a complete  merger

far  outweigh any additional autonomy or  short-term  advantages granted to the Singapore  State

Government  under a "tiga-suku"  merger.  May  I

repeat,  Sir,  the  long-term  advantages  of  a

complete  merger  far  outweigh  any  additional

autonomy or short-term advantages granted to the

Singapore State Government under a "tiga

suku" merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This additional autonomy of the State

Government  is more academic than real.  I  will

explain  the reasons later. Thus, the  paramount

issue  on  the  question of merger  is  that  of

citizenship. We want a genuine merger because we

want  to  see a united Malaya. We want a genuine

merger  because  it is only in a  united  Malaya

that  we  can  create the basic  conditions  for

progress  and  prosperity and  to  effect  basic

social and political changes for the benefit  of

all the races living in Malaya. In the years  of

colonial  history, the British had  adopted  the

policy of divide and rule. We have condemned the

policy but the constitutional set-up proposed in

the  White Paper could not defeat such a policy.

On  the contrary, it will consolidate the policy

of  divide and rule because, instead of a common

citizenship for all the peoples of Malaya, there

will be two types of citizenship.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such a constitutional arrangement as

envisaged  in the White Paper would  not  create

the  conditions for promoting undivided  loyalty

to the Malayan nation. No nation can be built on

two  types  of  citizenship.  Instead,  it  will

create much frustration and unhappiness.  It  is

only in a common citizenship that the people  of

a  country  can  share a common  aspiration  and

foster  a common Malayan patriotism. The absence

of   a   common  citizenship  in  the   proposed

constitutional set-up frustrates  our  hopes  of

building a united Malaya. And if these hopes are

frustrated, then events may force the people  of

Singapore  to  seek  their own  salvation  until

genuine  reunification  is  achieved.   It   is,

therefore,  my  Party's  contention   that   the

Singapore  Government  should  negotiate  for  a

genuine  merger  with provisions  for  Singapore

citizens to become Federal citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall take the case of Johore as an

example.  All  Johore  State  nationals   became

Federal  citizens by operation of law on Merdeka

Day.  Likewise, Singapore citizens should become

Federal  citizens. We will then enjoy  the  same

rights  and  shoulder  the same  obligations  as

Federal  citizens  living  in  other  parts   of

Malaya.  A  common  citizenship  is  thereby   a

necessary condition, if it is our earnest desire

to  build  up  a  common bond and  an  undivided

loyalty  towards Malaya. Sir, it is not  correct

to  say  that  if there is complete merger  only

284,000  out  of the 624,000 Singapore  citizens

could be qualified to become Federal citizens -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Automatic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Pardon?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - for the reason that only

284,000 were born in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the place of birth is a yardstick,

then  those Singapore citizens who were born  on

Federation  soil itself, like the  Minister  for

Finance  who has just interjected, and  most  of

whom are entitled to become Federal citizens  or

had  obtained Federal citizenship papers, should

have  no  trouble  in being given  back  Federal

citizenship. Then there are the rest of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



Singapore citizens, who were not born either  in

Singapore or in the Federation and who had  come

mainly from China and India. I say that if these

people  from China and India had been  domiciled

in  the  Federation  of  Malaya  instead  of  in

Singapore,   they  would  today  be   possessing

Federal   citizenship   instead   of   Singapore

citizenship.  The  requisite  number  of  year's

residence  is  almost the same, and  there  have

been   no   extra   practical  difficulties   in

obtaining   a   Federal  citizenship   than   in

obtaining  a  Singapore citizenship.  Therefore,

all  categories of citizens in Singapore  should

become  Federal citizens, i.e.,  those  born  in

Singapore,  those  born in the  Federation,  and

those born outside Singapore and the Federation.

I  cannot  see  any valid grounds why  Singapore

citizens  should not become Federal citizens  in

the  same  manner as the Johore State nationals,

who   are   the  equivalent  of  our   Singapore

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to repeat here the articles

in the Federal Constitution which bestow certain

rights  on  only Federal citizens,  nor  will  I

enumerate other rights reserved for citizens not

stipulated  in  the  written  Constitution.   Of

course,  it can always be argued, on  the  other

hand,   that   Federal  citizens  cannot   enjoy

privileges  and rights of Singapore citizens  if

they  come  and  live  in  Singapore.  And   the

argument   holds  good.  But  the   rights   and

privileges  of  citizenship  are  not  the  main

criterion,  in  my  contention,  for  a   common

citizenship   for   both   Singapore   and   the

Federation. Of course, these rights are no doubt

of  the utmost importance. My main contention is

that  it is only in a common citizenship that  a

Malayan  nation can be built and can be  united.

Nationalism cannot be built on weak foundations.

Nationalism  cannot be built  on  two  types  of

citizenship.  The concept of a Federal  national

would not bind the people of the two territories

together, just

as the concept of a Commonwealth citizen does

not bind the people of, say, Malaya and, for

instance, Australia together. How can we achieve

our cherished desire? Where is the basis to

build

a single united Malayan nation on a

foundation that is divided? I say it

is only in a common citizenship,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>

where    all   share   equal   rights,   common

obligations  and  destiny,  and  sink  or  swim

together, that we can build the massive base of

a  single,  united, political  identity  which

should  be the subject of our devotion  and  of

our undivided loyalty. Sir, my view is that the

constitutional  set-up proposed  in  the  White

Paper  is  as far as the Federation  Government

would  concede  to  the  Singapore  Government.

After  the Hong Lim by-election, the Federation

Government has apparently been convinced by the

Singapore Government that it is in

the  former's  interest to  do  something  about

Singapore.  But  the Federation Government  does

not  want  a  genuine merger. I  ask,  does  the

Singapore  Government want a genuine merger?  If

it  does, the Singapore Government must  consult

Opposition  Parties  at a roundtable  conference

and  tell  us its difficulties. We  can  plan  a

common  programme to negotiate  for  a  complete

merger. But the Singapore Government has refused

to   do  so.  It  has  bypassed  all  Opposition

Parties. It has agreed with the Federation on  a

constitutional set-up which is not  merger,  but

which   they  present  to  us  as  merger.   The

Singapore Government, in my view, should ask and

negotiate for a genuine merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is presented to us, Sir, in the White

Paper is not merger. I remember the Minister for

Labour  in  a speech at Nanyang University  said

(Straits  Times, 1st September, 1961)  that  the

proposed

constitutional  set-up is only  a  step  towards

reunification and towards merger,  but  not  the

final step. That would, in my opinion, be honest

admission, that the proposed set-up could  be  a

half-way  house and not a genuine  merger.  This

tiga  suku  merger  gives,  of  course,  to  the

Singapore  Government a special status,  special

in  the  sense that we would be like an  adopted

child - adopted   by  the  Federation   from   the

British.   Under   the  proposed   set-up,   the

Singapore  State  Government  can  only   govern

Singapore  under the sufferance of  the  Central

Federal Government. Although it has more powers - as compared to, say, the Johore State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



Government - the powers and relationship of such a

Singapore   State  Government  can   be   almost

equivalent to the powers and relationship of the

former City Council in relation to the Singapore

Government.  There  is,  of  course,  a  certain

degree of autonomy, but in the last analysis, it

is  the  Federal Parliament that shall have  the

final and the decisive say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall explain in the following few

minutes   the  relationship  between  a  Federal

Government  and  a State Government.  There  are

three  types of jurisdiction in the relationship

between   a  Federal  Government  and  a   State

Government   as   contained   in   the   Federal

Constitution.  First, there is  a  Federal  List

which  contains  all  those subject  matters  or

powers   which  are  exclusively  under  Federal

jurisdiction. A State Government has  absolutely

nothing  to  do  with  those  powers  under  the

Federal List. Second, there is a concurrent List

which  contains subject matters  which  a  State

Government  can administer at the  pleasure  and

with   the   general  agreement  of  a   Federal

Government.  Third, there is a State  List  which

contains subject matters and powers which remain

within the jurisdiction of a State Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are thus three Lists: a Federal

List,  a  concurrent List, and a State List.  In

the proposed constitutional

set-up  for  Singapore,  there  would  be   more

subject matters included in the concurrent  List

and  in  the  State List than are given  to  the

other  States  of the Federation.  There  is  no

necessity for me to discuss the powers under the

Federal  List, because it would have nothing  to

do  with the State Government, nor would I spend

time  on  the  concurrent  List  because  it  is

provided   constitutionally   that   the   final

legislative  and  executive  jurisdiction  rests

with  the Central Government. Now how about  the

subject  matters  in  the  State  List?  Sir,  a

Central Government which ii not friendly with  a

State  Government can restrain or hinder a State

Government in one or two ways from carrying  out

its  jurisdiction  either under  the  concurrent

List or under the State List. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>

can  do  so  either through the  constitutional

way,  that  is,  through the  Articles  of  the

Constitution,    or    through    the    extra-constitutional   way  or   through   both   the

constitutional way in conjuction with the extra-constitutional way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the constitutional way, there are

many  Articles  in the Federation  Constitution

which  provide  the  Central  Government   with

powers  to  make inroads into or to  check  the

authority of the State Government. I shall  not

enumerate these powers because it might lead to

confusion here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the extra-constitutional methods, that is,

methods which are not necessarily contained  in

the  written  Constitution, the most  effective

way  the Central Government can act against the

State  Government  is the Central  Government's

control over financial policy. We have seen how

this  is  being  done  in Federal  States  like

America, Australia and Canada. Needless to say,

there   are,   in  addition,  a  multitude   of

pressures  and sanctions which the Central  Gov

ernment  can  enforce  against  a  recalcitrant

State Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be said that the con

stitutional  proposals outlined  in  the  White

Paper  giving  the  Singapore State  Government

some  measure  of local autonomy are  not  just

plain  humbug.  The complete  negation  of  the

existence  of such autonomy cannot be conducive

to  an objective appraisal and a discussion  of

the merits and demerits of a genuine merger and

the  proposed constitutional set-up. But I  say

that  such  autonomy as envisaged in the  White

Paper  can only be effective and valid so  long

as  the Federation Government concurs or agrees

or  does  not raise serious objections  to  the

general   policies  of  the   Singapore   State

Government. As I have said, it is possible  for

the  Federation  Government to revert  back  to

itself  those subject matters in the concurrent

List.  On those subject matters in the  special

State  List for Singapore, which include labour

and  education, constitutional intervention  by

the Federation Government - that is, intervention

through the Articles of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>

Federation   Constitution - and/or  constitutional

sanctions  or pressures exerted by  the  Federal

Government  can  bring a recalcitrant  Singapore

State  Government to its knees or bring it  into

disrepute. There is no doubt, Sir, in  my  mind,

that  the  final power and authority  will  rest

with the Federal Government. As sovereignty  and

ultimate authority over Singapore now rest  with

the  British,  sovereignty will  rest  with  the

Federal  Parliament. Sir, the Federal Parliament

will be the source and fountain of political and

legislative power. No doubt, the final authority

could  thus  rest  with the  Federal  Government

which controls the Federal Parliament whether it

be  a  complete merger or whether it be  a  tiga

suku merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it must be stressed that we are not

objecting  to the principle of a strong  Central

Federal  Government.  In  fact,  only  a  strong

Central  Federal Government can bring prosperity

and  stability to a country. But what we  object

to is the constitutional arrangement whereby the

main  purpose of reunification which is to build

a united Malaya would be defeated. In a complete

merger, Sir, there would be no autonomy on educa

tion and labour and various other subjects,  but

there  would be a common citizenship.  Singapore

State  would be like Johore State. In a complete

merger, the Singapore State Government will have

less  powers than under a tiga suku merger,  but

in  my  view,  the difference in autonomy  of  a

Singapore State Government in a complete  merger

and  in  a  tiga  suku merger is, for  practical

purposes, not of substantial importance. On  the

other   hand,   the  advantages  of   a   common

citizenship will not only provide the foundation

for  fostering patriotism and the building of  a

united  Malayan nation but also on the principle

of  one man one vote the people of Singapore, as

citizens of a united Federation of Malaya,  can,

through the constitutional machinery, play their

part  in shaping the course of political  events

for the progress of Malaya.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Government has made a

"bargain".  In  exchange for 15 seats  and  some

measure  of autonomy in certain subject matters - for example, education and labour - it is prepared

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>

concede   the  basic  principle  of  a   common

citizenship for the two territories. I say that

the  people  are  not  in  favour  of  such   a

constitutional arrangement. The people  want  a

genuine merger and a common citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party is in full support of the feelings

expressed  in the motion moved by the  Minister

for  Labour, because merger evokes a  patriotic

sentiment and kindles the torch of nationalism.

No  true  patriot of Malaya can help but  share

those feelings with the Minister for Labour. It

is   our  basic  policy  to  subscribe  to  the

principle  of  a united Malaya.  The  amendment

moved by the Member for Queenstown brings  into

prominence the paramount issue in merger, which

is the citizenship question. In our view, there

is  no  contradiction or conflict  between  the

motion  of  the  Minister for  Labour  and  the

amendment  of  the  Member  for  Queenstown.  A

common  citizenship is necessary in  a  genuine

merger.  We support the motion of the  Minister

for Labour and we also support the amendment of

the Member for Queenstown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You support everybody!

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> But what we do not support

is  the  motion  of the Prime Minister  on  the

White  Paper which My Party declares is not  in

accord   with   the  spirit   of   merger   and

contradicts  the motion moved by  the  Minister

for Labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always stood for merger. As far back

as  June 1960, we have asked the Government  to

initiate merger talks. Nobody in this House can

condemn  us  for advocating merger  openly  and

opposing  merger privately. We want  a  genuine

merger  which will bring back our vision  of  a

united  Malaya  where all races  will  live  in

complete  and perfect harmony. The White  Paper

will  not  give  us such a genuine  merger.  My

Party therefore rejects the White Paper.

<br><br>3.58 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Queenstown,  in  moving his  amendment  to  the

motion standing in the name of the Minister for

Labour, alleged that the Tunku was suddenly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>

persuaded  to  agree to merger  because  of  the

alleged  P.A.P. "sell-out" over the question  of

citizenship.  I must say I find it difficult  to

follow  his  confused thinking and  unravel  his

involved argument.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We analysed as early as 1958 in our 4th

Anniversary  Party  Souvenir entitled  "The  New

Phase  After  Merdeka" that there are  two  main

reasons why the Federation Government were  wary

of merger:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'First: Singapore has about one million

Chinese. The inclusion of this one million  into

the Federation will upset the racial balance  of

power in the Federation. Second: Singapore  has

too many "leftists" who are supported by the one million Chinese in Singapore.'

<br><br>To the Alliance leaders, they believe all

"leftists" may be Communists of varying degrees.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  Would the Hon. Minister table  a  copy  of

that  document so that hon. Members can  consult

it now?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister quoting from a

document?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

have  it  with me, but I thought it  is  one  of

those  documents that everybody has  read  again

and again.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If it is a document from

which  the Minister is quoting, then, of course,

that  document should be produced.  Perhaps  the

Minister will undertake to produce copies.  That

will satisfy the Member.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Queenstown, I am glad to say, accepted this

analysis    of    the   P.A.P. without    any

qualification.  He  signed a statement  to  that

effect.  The fact that the Federation Government

refused automatic conversion of citizenship  has

once again reflected the two basic fears of  the

Federation. Instead of going all out to convince

the Federation that the Chinese in Singapore are

Malayan   conscious  and  that   the   Left-wing

elements are not all Communists, that we want to

be  friends with the Federation and  not  to  be

hostile   to  the  Federation,  these  ex-P.A.P.

Members now in the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>

Sosialis have allowed themselves to be inveigled

by the Communists into doing just the opposite.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> According to the

P.M., of course!

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> For by their speech and

actions, by playing up to chauvinistic and  pro-Communist  elements, they have tried  to  arouse

the   very   fears  which  made  the  Federation

hesitate about merger, that is, too many Chinese

who  are  China-orientated and too many Leftists

who   are   Communist  inclined.  The  kind   of

propaganda  the Barisan Sosialis  are  following

will  only  strengthen the  Federation's  belief

that  the  Barisan Sosialis type of merger  with

automatic  conversion  of  citizenship   was   a

dangerous  proposition to  be  accepted  at  the

present juncture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis is of the view that the

present   Federation  Government  is  in   close

alliance with foreign capital; it has bound  the

country to the so-called "British Malaya  mutual

defence treaty" and turned our motherland into a

military  base  for  British armed  forces;  its

foreign  policy has alienated our  country  from

the   main  stream  of  Afro-Asia,  particularly

Indonesia,   Ghana  and  India;   its   internal

policies are repressive, particularly, to  trade

unions and intellectuals; freedom of expression,

organisation,  and  other  civil  liberties  are

curbed, and its educational policy is misguided.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> What does the P.A.P. say to

that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Nevertheless, "we [the

Barisan Sosialis] are prepared to accept  merger

under   these  conditions  provided  it   occurs

immediately   and  is  followed  by  pan-Malayan

general elections."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is this the kind of attitude

to be adopted by people who want to seek concord

and  come  to a satisfactory agreement with  the

elected Federation Government? Rather, it openly

declares to the Federation the true intention of

the  hidden  masters  of the  Barisan  Sosialis,

i.e., to make use of Singapore as a base and the

merger  the means of overthrowing the Federation

Government and set up a pro-Communist State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains their insistence on automatic

citizenship   so  that  they  could   stand   as

candidates   in   the  Federation.   The   whole

objection  to the P.A.P. type of merger  is  not

because  the  prosperity of  Singapore  and  the

livelihood  of  the  people  will  be  adversely

affected (in fact, the Member for Queenstown has

admitted  in his speech that nobody in Singapore

will be adversely affected), but because in  the

P.A.P. type of merger, the interests of  a  few

politically  ambitious  individuals - the   real

masters  for  whom the Member for Queenstown  is

working,  will be unable to stand as  candidates

and  be elected in the Federation. The interests

of  a few politically ambitious individuals  are

the  real  reason  why they  are  afraid  of  en

trusting internal security in the hands  of  the

new  Federation  legislature in which  Singapore

will  be  represented. For  unlike  the  genuine

democrats    and   nationalists,    these    few

individuals,  in  keeping with Communist  theory

and  practice,  indulge in open legal  political

activities and also

underground illegal activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis leaders know that even now

the  Internal Security Council has the necessary

powers  to  deal  with these few individuals  if

they go beyond the limit. In entrusting internal

security, a power which has never been wholly in

the  hands of the Singapore Government,  to  the

elected  Federation Government, there is neither

gain  nor loss to the Singapore people. However,

to  the  Communists, there is a great difference

as  explained by the Prime Minister in his radio

talks: "To be imprisoned by the

British colonialists is to be a martyr,  in  the

company  of  Mr Nehru, Dr Nkrumah,  Dr  Banda

and  many other anti-colonial nationalists.  But

to  be  locked up by Mr Nehru, Dr Nkrumah,  or

Col.   Nasser  or  the  Tunku  is  an   entirely

different   matter,"  and  hence,  the   Barisan

Sosialis' agitation over internal security being

transferred  from  the hands of  the  tripartite

Internal   Security  Council  to   the   elected

Federation  Government, in which Singapore  will

have a part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis, or its

real  masters, know more than anyone  else  that

their   proposal  for  merger,  with   automatic

conversion of citizenship



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



rights  (a  right which is not even enjoyed  by

Penang  or  Malacca) will not be acceptable  to

the  Federation Government. But then,  one  may

ask,  why  did they put forward a  proposal  of

capturing  the  Federation Government,  knowing

very  well  that  it will be turned  down?  The

answer  is  that they do not want a  merger  at

this  stage when there is a government  in  the

Federation  which views unfavourably  Communist

and  pro-Communist activities. What the Barisan

Sosialis really want is complete internal self-government,  even  though it  means  prolonging

colonial  rule since the British will still  be

in  charge  of defence and foreign  affairs.  A

contradiction  which can only be  explained  by

the  fact that they are only fighting for their

sectional interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reunification of Singapore with the Federation

is     inevitable    because    geographically,

culturally and economically, Singapore is  part

of  the Federation. Reunification has been  the

slogan  of  all genuine nationalists and  anti-colonialists  since  1946.  For   the   Barisan

Sosialis  to go against the aspiration  of  the

people will be utter folly. Yet, deep in  their

hearts,  they  do  not want a merger  with  the

Central Government in charge of security. As  a

way  out  of this dilemma, they seek to confuse

the  people with a merger proposal that is  not

acceptable  to  the Federation,  so  that  they

could  fight  for complete internal self-government  without  being accused by the  people  of

prolonging  colonial rule. It was, to  use  the

words  of  the Member for Queenstown, "a  sell-out", a traitorous move by the Barisan Sosialis

to   sell  the  independence  and  freedom   of

Singapore to the British colonial rulers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi accused the P.A.P. of

wanting to remain in power and therefore  seeks

the  Tunku's  help.  He said  that  the  people

wanted  the  Government to return the  mandate.

The  P.A.P. refused to do so. So they  quickly

brought  about the merger issue and  threatened

the  people  with  imaginary  consequences   if

merger  does  not take place. The move  by  the

P.A.P. according



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>

to  the  Member  for Changi, was an  attempt  to

enable  the  "ruling class"  to  continue  their

control over the people and stay in power for  a

further period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as with all phoney socialists

and  anti-colonialists, they always  speak  with

their  tongues in their cheeks. Far  from  being

eager to remain in office, we were the first  to

suggest  returning  the mandate  to  the  people

after the Hong Lim by-election. But who were the

people  who  resisted most  strenuously  at  our

Party  conference? None other than  the  13  ex-P.A.P.

Assemblymen  and  Parliamentary Secretaries  who

are  now in the Barisan Sosialis. They were  the

people  who  stood  up one after  the  other  to

oppose the suggestion of holding a referendum on

whether  the P.A.P. should continue  in  office.

They  were  scared of the prospect of having  to

return  the mandate to the people for fear  that

they  would  not be re-elected.  This  fear  was

subtly  and  effectively exploited  by  the  Com

munists. Overnight, we found them, one after the

other, standing up for the pro-Communist line of

"internal  self-government without the  I.S.C.",

and  finally  culminating in their  betrayal  of

their  comrades  and  Party.  Ever  since  their

failure to capture the Party and the Government,

they now demand we should return the mandate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remind the Member for Changi and all

the  other Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen that the

very people who should return the mandate to the

people  are  the ex-P.A.P. Assemblymen  who  had

defected to the Barisan Sosialis. They were  the

candidates who stood on the P.A.P. platform  and

were  elected on P.A.P. policies, one  of  which

was   independence  through  merger  which   was

endorsed by the people years ago. They signed  a

pledge in April 1959 in which they categorically

pledged  to support the policy of merger between

the  Federation and Singapore as set out in  the

P.A.P.  Central Executive Committee's  statement

published  in  the 4th Anniversary  Souvenir  in

1958.  They  also  pledged to resign  from  this

Assembly if they were to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>

be expelled from the Party. It is the ex-P.A.P.

in  the Barisan Sosialis who have betrayed  and

disavowed P.A.P. political objectives and  were

expelled from the Party. If they are not men of

straw,  if they have any honour and decency  in

them,  they should resign and seek a fresh  man

date  on  the Barisan Sosialis platform  before

coming here. [Interruption.]

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

opportunism and political ambition  of  the  ex-P.A.P. in  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have   been

exploited by the pro-Communists who do not  want

merger.  The  ex-P.A.P.  Assemblymen  have  been

trapped  into  stabbing their own  comrades  and

indulging in shameful betrayal of the Party. Mr

Speaker, Sir, political leaders who could  "sell

out"  their Party and comrades in a crucial  by-election  are  not  men  whose  words  could  be

trusted.   The  amendment  proposed   by   these

political  traitors, therefore, is  not  genuine

and  cannot  be taken seriously.  It  should  be

judged  in the light of their traitorous actions

in Anson. The Member for Queenstown may consider

himself  heroic when he said that in putting  up

their  merger  proposal they were  prepared  for

sacrifices and even arrests for their  political

convictions.  But may I remind  the  Member  for

Queenstown (and the Member for Nee Soon) that

they  did  not  join  the P.A.P. in  the  anti-colonial  struggle until 1959 when the  days  of

risks were over?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Prove that! Prove that!

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Interruption is all right

in  a way, but when it becomes unseemly then  it

is very disorderly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> And incidentally, may I

inform  the Member for Queenstown, and also  the

Member  for  Changi, that such brave words  have

been  uttered by many a person in the past,  but

subsequent events do not bear testimony  to  the

value  of such words. I remember on the  eve  of

the  second purge by the Lim Yew Hock Government

in  1957,  the Member for Havelock, as the  then

Secretary of the Tanjong Pagar Branch,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>

gathered the Branch Committee and vowed solemnly

before  the P.A.P. symbol that all should  stand

solidly  together  and face  the  coming  storm.

Brave words indeed! However, when the storm  and

the  rain did come, the Member for Havelock  and

some  of  his  friends found themselves  in  the

Federation, leaving those of us who have not the

opportunity  to thump our chest and express  our

courage  and  comradeship to re-gather  and  re-organise the abandoned flock to put them in this

Assembly.  Mr Speaker, Sir, for any merger  pro

posed  to succeed, it must be based on realistic

principles  and must be practical.  It  must  be

fair  and  just both to the people of  Singapore

and  the people of the Federation. It is  futile

to   fight   for  the  exclusive  interests   of

Singapore  and  yet  expect  the  Federation  to

accept  such  a plan, which is what the  Barisan

Sosialis amendment seeks to do. It is no use pre

tending that the Barisan Sosialis' proposals are

practical   or  acceptable  to  the  people   of

Singapore or the Federation. The Tunku has  said

that  he  is not prepared to agree to  automatic

conversion of citizenship because of the liberal

citizenship laws in Singapore in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the Barisan Sosialis have demonstrated

their  insincerity  in their  stand  on  merger.

First, they suggest the entry of Singapore as  a

constituent State of the Federation like  Penang

or Malacca. Since then, however, this demand for

merger  on  the basis of Penang or  Malacca  has

been  dropped  and  even in the  7�  hours  long

speech  of  the  Member for Queenstown  in  this

Assembly,  not a single reference  was  made  to

this  original stunt of theirs. They  must  have

realised  after the radio forum,  in  which  the

Member   for  Queenstown  participated  in   his

capacity as Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis  on

22nd  September,  1961, that  for  Singapore  to

enter the Federation on the same basis as Penang

and Malacca would mean the disenfranchisement of

about 340,000 present Singapore citizens. And to

extricate themselves from their predicament, the

Member  for Queenstown spent nearly 7� hours  in

this  Assembly  to  prove  that  the  Federation

Parliament  has the power under  Article  22  to

grant automatic citizenship rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>

to  Singapore  citizens - a  fact  which  no  one

disputes.  But  the  question  is  whether  the

Federation   is  prepared  to  accept   special

citizenship rights being accorded to  Singapore

but  denied to Penang or Malacca which  was  an

integral part of the Federation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown said that it is not

fair   and   just  if  there  is  no  automatic

citizenship after merger. Is it fair  and  just

then to our brothers in Penang and Malacca  who

did not enjoy such rights?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, being only interested in

advancing  the  sectional interests  of  a  few

ambitious politicians to stand for election  in

Kelantan  and Trengganu, is prepared  to  wreck

the merger proposals. Are the vast majority  of

ordinary people who have no political ambitions

of   standing  for  election  in  Trengganu  or

Kelantan willing to allow their interests to be

sacrificed in this way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown accused the P.A.P.

of  selling out the interests of the people  of

Singapore   because  we  did  not   press   for

automatic citizenship rights. But what are  the

interests that we have been accused of  selling

out?   In   our  merger  proposals,  will   any

Singapore  citizen  lose his  citizenship?  The

answer is "No". The White Paper setting out the

heads  of  agreement for a merger  between  the

Federation  of  Malaya  and  Singapore   states

categorically that "all Singapore citizens will

keep their citizenship" and "Singapore citizens

will  continue to enjoy their state rights  and

privileges within Singapore." Yet, we have  the

Member  for Changi deliberately saying in  this

House  that Singapore citizens will lose  their

citizenship   on   merger  under   the   P.A.P.

proposals.  Whom  is  he going  to  bluff?  Mr

Speaker, Sir, if a man has decided to close his

mind to all reason and logic, then you can  sit

and  talk till the cow comes home and you  will

not  be able to make him move from the position

that  he  has taken. If, therefore, the  Member

for Changi chooses to be a cow, then no one can

move him by reason or logic.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> On a point of order. Is it

proper  that a Member of this House  should  be

described as a cow?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The objection is well taken. I do

not  think we have, in fact, in the past allowed

any  Member to be described as any animal.  Will

the Minister withdraw that word?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was just

illustrating how stubborn

some people are.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Some people are stubborn, as

stubborn as a mule. But even then I do not think

a  Member can be likened to a mule. Perhaps  the

Minister will just withdraw and not debate my

ruling.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I withdraw

the  word.  As I have said, Sir, in  our  merger

proposals, no Singapore citizen is going to lose

his  citizenship and the rights  and  privileges

that  go  with it. In addition, every  Singapore

citizen  on merger will gain Federal nationality

and  will  be  able, for the first time  in  150

years   of   colonial  domination,  to   proudly

proclaim   to  be  national  of  an  independent

Federation  of Malaya or Malaysia.  Perhaps  the

Barisan  Sosialis  would feel prouder  still  if

they  would  remain  as British  subjects  in  a

complete internal self-government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any merger proposal, the object must be the

furtherance  and protection of the interests  of

the   broad  masses  of  the  people,  not   the

interests  of  a  few ambitious politicians  who

want  to  stand for election in Ipoh or Kuantan.

This is what precisely the P.A.P. type of merger

proposals  seek to achieve. No  one  can  be  so

blind as to ignore the fact that as a result  of

16   years  of  separation  engineered  by   the

colonial  rulers, differences of  interests  and

attitudes  exist today. Such differences  cannot

be  wiped out overnight without causing consider

able  unhappiness to the people. And instead  of

bringing  about merger in a happy  and  peaceful

manner,  there  may be chaos and  violence.  The

P.A.P., being realists and taking cognizance  of

the   objective  political  conditions  existing

today, has decided to reserve for itself reserve

powers  in Labour and Education and other social

services  with a view to achieving merger  in  a

peaceful way. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>

Barisan  Sosialis'  real bosses,  on  the  other

hand,  were unable to extricate themselves  from

their inflexible doctrinaire approach which  can

only lead to riots and civil commotion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. way of merger will ensure the

existing  interests and promotion  prospects  of

our  civil service and, in addition, there  will

be  opportunities for entry into Federal service

to look after the Pan-Malayan departments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese parents who want their children to go

to  Chinese  schools will be able to  do  so  as

under the present policy of equal treatment  for

all  streams of education, and after graduation,

equal opportunities for employment will go on in

Singapore. Workers will be assured that the pro-labour  policy and legislation they have enjoyed

will continue. Businessmen, contractors, and bus

companies  and  taxis will not be worried  about

privileges  or  special rights  for  anybody  in

trading  and business. Merchants will be assured

that  the  free port status and free trade  with

all countries will continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis type of merger proposal,

on  the other hand, will straightaway bring  the

civil  service under the 4:1 ratio  between  the

Malays  and  non-Malays. There will  be  restric

tions  to  the  granting  of  certain  types  of

business  and contracts to non-Malays.  Many  of

the  Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen will not  even

be   sitting  in  this  House  and  those  whose

political  ambitions lead them to  betray  their

colleagues  and the P.A.P. by defecting  to  the

Barisan  Sosialis  will  find  their  hopes   of

standing  for  election  vanish  into  thin  air

because the Barisan Sosialis type of merger will

mean  the  immediate application of English  and

Malay  as  the official languages for the  State

Assembly as well as the Federal Parliament.  The

Member for Jalan Kayu might take note of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates of Chinese schools and Nanyang

University  whom  the Barisan Sosialis  wish  to

exploit  will  not  be accepted  for  government

service.  Chinese school students will  have  to

sit   for  their  public  examinations  in   the

official



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>

languages  of Malay and English, a matter  which

the   Barisan  Sosialis  dare  not  talk  about,

knowing  it  will be unpalatable to the  Chinese

school  students whom they seek  to  involve  in

their united front activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown said that the

P.A.P.'s proposal to give "educational rights to

the  Chinese here different from those available

in  the  Federation," would mean that the people

in  Singapore  would be isolated from  the  rest

across the Causeway creating new cleavages among

the    different   communities   through   their

different  educational rights. "It was  a  path,

[according  to  him], leading  not  to  national

unity  but to national disunity and to  war.  It

was  a  path  that every man, however desperate,

must avoid."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me make clear

to  this House that no one disagrees with him in

principle, that the education system in both the

Federation  and Singapore must be  the  same  to

make for one national identity and loyalty.  The

difference  between the P.A.P. and  the  Barisan

Sosialis  on this educational issue  is  one  of

time,  of  when to merge the present differences

into  one.  First, let me explain what immediate

acceptance  of  the Federation education  policy

means vis-a-vis Chinese education. This is vital

and  one which the Barisan Sosialis leaders seek

to  gloss  over in their public statements.  The

most  unhappy feature and one which evokes  most

heat  and  agitation  by  the  Chinese  in   the

Federation  in  respect  of  the  Rahman   Talib

Education   Report   is  that   of   medium   of

instruction  and examination. The  Rahman  Talib

Report  provides that the medium of  instruction

in  Chinese Primary Schools shall be in Chinese.

As  for the Chinese Secondary Schools, the  main

medium  of  instruction shall  be  in  Malay  or

English  with  Chinese language  and  literature

reduced  to  one-third of curriculum  time.  How

ever,  the  examination's for the  Lower  School

Certificate    and    the   Federation    School

Certificate,   the  two  officially   recognised

certificates for jobs in Government and teaching

service,  and  for  further  studies,  shall  be

conducted  in Malay or English. It is true  that

Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>

could   still   be  used  as  the   medium   of

instruction  in Chinese Secondary Schools,  but

such  schools would become independent schools,

i.e., receive no government aid. All of us will

remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there  was  an

immediate  reaction  from the  Chinese  in  the

Federation   and  charges  of  elimination   of

Chinese   culture  and  education  were   made.

Chinese  education became the central issue  in

political agitation against the Federation  Gov

ernment by communal parties such as the  P.P.P.

and  even  in  the Sosialist Front  and  Rahman

Talib  Report led to a split between the  Malay

and   the  Chinese  wings  and  the  threatened

resignation of its President, Ahmad  Boestaman.

In   Singapore,   scathing   attacks - no   doubt

heartily supported by the Barisan Sosialis - were

made  by  Nanyang University students in  their

publication.  These  were the  results  in  the

Federation  where the Chinese do not  form  the

majority of the population. If the

Barisan  Sosialis type of proposal is  accepted

and,  overnight,  the Chinese  school  students

find themselves having to learn in Chinese  but

be  examined in English or Malay or  be  taught

and   examined  in  Malay  or  English  in  the

secondary   schools,  the  position   will   be

catastrophic   in   Singapore   where   it   is

essentially very much a Chinese city.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They go on strike like

today!

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Far from achieving

national unity, the Barisan Sosialis  type  of

merger proposal will

invite  mass  agitation and rallies  and  lead

eventually   to   violence   and   chaos   and

suppression. It would be indeed, in the  words

of  the Member for Queenstown, "a path leading

to national disunity and to war". As it is now

with  equal  treatment  in  Singapore  to  all

streams  of  education  with  the  medium   of

instruction  in the respective mother  tongues

in  primary and secondary schools and also  in

Nanyang  University and full grant-in-aids  to

schools, some students in Chinese schools,  no

doubt,  forming part of the present  political

struggle  promoted by the M.C.P. through  the

Barisan Sosialis, the unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>

and   rural  organisations,  are   already

agitating against secondary school examinations,

mind  you, in their own mother tongue.  On  this

agitation, it is also of interest to  note  that

the  Barisan Sosialis' official organ gave  full

coverage  and  support to it. Does  the  Barisan

Sosialis seriously suggest that it is willing to

accept  the present Federation education  policy

immediately? Perhaps the answer is already found

in  their conspicuous silence on this subject in

their open statements and public rallies. May  I

suggest to the Barisan Sosialis that if they are

genuine   and  sincerely  believe  in  accepting

immediately  the  Federation  education  policy,

they  should  first put their  proposal  to  the

people and seek their support? For us, while  we

believe in the principle of one common education

policy for the whole of Malaya, nevertheless, we

are of the opinion that this, being an emotional

issue, should come about more gradually,  if  we

are  to team from the Federation experience,  so

that  our  path  to  merger  will  not  lead  to

disunity and war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that if merger is

to  be achieved in a peaceful manner with no one

losing  any  of  its existing rights,  then  the

amendment  moved  by the Member  for  Queenstown

will not achieve it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot seek merger by taking up fixed

positions. Problems of merger must be approached

on   the   basis   of  "seeking  concord   while

maintaining  differences", a  slogan  which  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and their real  masters  have

dropped,  perhaps  a bit too quickly  when  they

find  that this slogan no longer works to  their

advantage. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the latter  half

of  1960  the M.C.P. was pursuing the policy  of

"struggle and unite" vis-a-vis the P.A.P.  Later

when  they  discovered that the P.A.P. was  not

stooging  for them, the slogan of  the  day  "to

seek concord while maintaining differences"  was

mouthed  by  every front organisation  at  their

meetings.  But  when  they discovered  that  the

P.A.P. was   not  prepared  to  accept   their

objective of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>

fighting for full internal self-government but,

instead,  was pursuing its avowed objective  of

independence through merger, which everyone  of

the 13 Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen was pledged

to  fight for and on which they were elected by

the  people, the slogan was dropped. Since then

they  have  resorted  to unproved  slogan  like

"sellout".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi said that just because

they, the Barisan Sosialis, fought

for  self-government and not merger, therefore,

the  P.A.P. ruling class accused them  of  pro-British. The Member for Changi then went on  to

explain why the Barisan Sosialis demanded self-government   instead   of   merger    and    be

independent.  He  explained  that  the  British

Government came from abroad and not elected  by

the   local  people.  Similarly,  the   Malayan

Government  also  came  from  outside  and  not

elected by the Singapore people. As such, under

the  P.A.P. merger  proposal,  Singapore  will

still remain as a self-governing State with its

defence, internal security, and foreign affairs

transferred  from the British  colonialists  to

the Right-wing Government of Malaya.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can anyone still doubt that

the Member for Changi and the Barisan Sosialis,

the so-called genuine anti-colonialists, prefer

the  British  colonialists to  the  independent

Malayan  Government? Since the British colonial

Government came from outside and not elected by

the  local  people, and the Malayan  Government

also  came from outside and not elected by  the

local  people, why not continue to be  a  self-government under the British colonialists?  Why

transfer   the  power  over  defence,  internal

security  and  foreign affairs to  the  Malayan

nationalists? Are not the British  colonialists

just  as good, if not more efficient? Why fight

for  a  merger although it means that Singapore

will  be  an  integral part of the  independent

Federation of Malaya? Why give up the status of

British  subjects,  and  therefore  under   the

protection  of the mighty imperial  power,  for

nationals  of the new Federation of  Malaya  or

Malaysia?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me tell the Member for Changi and the

Barisan  Sosialis leaders that  the  P.A.P.,  as

true  Malayan nationalists, would rather entrust

our   defence,  internal  security  and  foreign

affairs  to  the independent Malayan  Government

elected by the Singapore and Malayan people, who

are  our own brothers and sisters and who  share

with us the same common aspiration, than to  the

British colonialists who are not elected by  the

local people and responsible only to the British

people.  We  would  rather carry  a  Malayan  or

Malaysian passport than a British passport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Changi is still confused by

his own dialectics and cannot see any difference

between  the  British colonialists  and  Malayan

nationalists, then I pity the students under his

tutelage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. regard Singapore

and  the  Federation of Malaya as one people  in

one   territorial  unit.  The  people   of   the

Federation are our brothers and sisters  in  the

same   family  coming  together  after  a   long

separation  by  the colonial rulers.  No  doubt,

after  16  years  of separation, certain  differ

ences of views may have developed, but we regard

these differences, to use the phrase of Chairman

Mao  as  "the  internal  contradictions  of  the

people"  which  can be resolved  in  a  friendly

manner. The leaders of the Barisan Sosialis, who

are  supposed to be ardent followers of Chairman

Mao, appear to have applied the analysis in  the

wrong   direction.  Instead  of  regarding   the

Federation  Government and  the  people  as  our

brothers  and  our peoples, they  have  regarded

them  as foreigners and enemies; and the British

as  their  friends to whom they are prepared  to

entrust  defence  and foreign relations  of  the

State.  The  Barisan Sosialis, in  accusing  the

Federation  Government  of  being  a  colonial

government  policing interests for  the  British

and  attempting  to  subjugate  the  people   of

Singapore,  have  declared  their  intention  to

strengthen the forces in the Federation in their

struggle against the Federation Government  and,

consequently,   demanded  a   general   election

immediately   so  that  they  can  capture   the

Federation. This,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, is not the language of people

who genuinely seek concord. This is the language

of  war.  The differences between Singapore  and

the   Federation,  according  to   the   Barisan

Sosialis  analysis, are not to  be  regarded  as

only  the internal contradictions of the people,

but antagonistic contradictions between enemies.

In short, Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment to the

motion is not a genuine desire to seek merger by

the  Barisan Sosialis, but a camouflage to wreck

merger.   The  Barisan  Sosialis  today   stands

condemned as the enemy of reunification  of  the

two  peoples,  the enemy of Malayan nationalism.

They  have  become instead the  allies  of  anti

national  elements. They would  rather  carry  a

British  passport  than  the  passport   of   an

independent Federation.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has  said

that  there has been a lot of confusion. I agree

with  him. I could not agree with him more.  But

the  trouble  is  that he confuses  us  more  by

saying that he supports both the motion and  the

amendment.  In fact, I am not very sure  whether

he  is not a little confused himself because the

motion

reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . .this House affirms and declares that the

first  objective of all true patriots of  Malaya

is to achieve the reunification of these

two territories in a merger-'

<br><br>I repeat "in a merger" -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'.

<br><br>It  does  not say a phoney merger or  a  genuine

merger  or a confederation merger. It just  says

"in  a merger" - a merger as the world understands

as  dictionaries  or political  books  give  its

meaning. But here we have been sitting  - I  think

this  is  the seventh day - and debating  on  what

sort  of  merger: phoney merger, genuine merger,

complete  merger or three-quarters  merger.  All

that the motion asks us to answer is, "Do you or

do  you  not want merger?" If we want a  merger,

then  let us sit down and discuss the motion  on

the White Paper. If we do not want merger, it is

nonsense to ask what kind

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>

of  merger.  What  is the use of  talking  about

details  of  merger when we do not want  merger?

This  motion just seeks to ask us, "Do you  want

it  or not? If you want it, we will proceed.  If

not, we will not proceed." What happens? We have

sat down for seven days and, as you put it. Sir,

confusion  mounts on confusion until  I  do  not

know whether it has confused the Member for Hong

Lim  so  much  that  he is supporting  both  the

motion and the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Straits Times of 24th November,

page  12, on the speech of the Member for  Anson

in  regard  to  the  amendment  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  to  the  motion of  the  Minister  for

Labour,  there  were very big headlines  in  the

half-inch  letters - you  seldom  get   such   big

headlines - that that amendment gives two meanings

to the word "merger". My question is, "Does it?"

The  answer  is "No.". The Member for  Anson  is

reported  also to have said that  he  could  not

have  agreed more with the Member for  Cairnhill

in  that  merger could only mean merger - this  is

from   the   same  newspaper - with  the  complete

reunification  of the two territories,  and  the

citizens  completely identified as  citizens  of

the  Federation. He continued, however,  to  say

that   that   was  what  the  Barisan   Sosialis

amendment is seeking to clarify. Sir, if  merger

means  that  the citizens of the two territories

are  completely  identified as citizens  of  the

Federation,  it  would also mean that  Singapore

citizens  would  enjoy all  the  rights  of  the

Federal  citizens.  It is not  just  these  two - automatic   citizenship  and  the  entrance   of

Singapore into the Federation - but all the rights

of the Federal citizens. May I ask, Sir, whether

the  entrance of Singapore as the twelfth  State

and  the automatic citizenship for Singapore are

the  only  two  conditions  that  constitute   a

genuine   merger?  No.  There  are  many   other

conditions  and  rights that  comprise - what  the

Barisan  Sosialis call - a genuine  merger.  These

two  conditions on their own do not in  any  way

constitute  a  genuine  merger  or  a   complete

merger. Then why should we mention these two and

leave out all the others,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>

especially when on the motion no one has  tried

to  specify any type of merger? And rightly so,

why should they?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the motion is defeated, what will be

the  effect of it? The motion asks, "Do you want

a  merger?" If the motion is defeated,  then  we

show that we do not want a merger. I think, Sir,

it  is  nonsense  then to go on to  discuss  the

motion  on  the White Paper. If this House  does

not  want  that sort of merger at all,  we  must

first  indicate whether we want or do  not  want

merger.  It  may  be  argued,  Sir,  but  it  is

understood.  It  has been said  several  times - outside this Chamber, inside and everywhere - that

all  Parties want merger, that everyone realises

that  the separation between the territories  is

artificial  and  that  we  all  agree  that  the

reunification   of   the  two   territories   is

inevitable.  It  may be said  it  is  taken  for

granted.  This  is exactly what  the  motion  is

seeking to confirm and to place on record. As  I

read  it,  it just says, "Do you want merger  or

not?" It has naturally not specified whether  it

is  the  P.A.P. phoney merger  or  the  Barisan

Sosialis   genuine   merger   or   the    S.P.A.

confederation type of merger, but just merger as

everyone  in the world understands it.  Had  the

motion  made an attempt at limiting the  meaning

of  the word by saying this merger or the P.A.P.

type of merger or even the merger which is under

discussion,  then  probably  the  amendment   is

justified;  we do not want that type of  merger.

But  then the motion has not specified what type

of  merger. So we take it that the word "merger"

means  what  the  world  understands  the   word

"merger" to mean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been here, Sir, I think, seven days,

not listening to whether we want merger or not,

and  if  we want merger why, and if we  do  not

want merger, why do we not want it, but hearing

accusations and condemnations to and fro,  from

P.A.P. to  ex-P.A.P. and back again.  We  have

beard  very  strong words used - as a  matter  of

fact, I believe to many of us, the strongest we

have  heard  in  our lives.  We  have  heard  a

protest  in  the  form of a  marathon  7�-hour

speech  and  we are presented with  a  proposed

amendment. We have been debating it  for  about

seven days. And all because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>

we  were  asked, "Do you want a merger or  not?"

Everybody says, "We want a merger." But we spent

seven days arguing.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think for the record

this is the sixth day.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir.

You  see, even I am confused! Honestly, Sir,  is

the amendment necessary? Does it make the motion

any  more acceptable? Many people think yes, but

I  say  no,  Sir.  On the contrary,  it  is  not

because  we  do  not  want  genuine  merger   or

automatic  citizenship. But if the amendment  is

accepted - in other words, the motion becomes a Ba

risan  Sosialis type of merger,  because,  as  I

pointed  out  just  now, a genuine  merger  will

consist of more than two rights, and to put just

the two rights that the Barisan Sosialis wish to

emphasise would make it a Barisan Sosialis  type

of   merger - then  it  would  probably  be   less

acceptable  than just the word "merger"  as  the

world understands it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Sir, merger means that

all  rights enjoyed by Federal citizens will  be

conferred on the present Singapore citizens  who

will  be Federal citizens. There are many rights

enjoyed  by the Federal citizens. If we  are  to

catalogue all those rights, I am afraid that the

amendment is going to be a bigger document  than

the White Paper itself, because I am sure we too

have  our  own  ideas  of  how  the  people   of

Singapore  should  benefit  by  a  merger,   and

probably  all the other Parties here have  their

own  ideas too besides the Barisan Sosialis. The

Barisan Sosialis must remember that probably the

Federation  too  has  its own  idea  of  what  a

genuine  merger is and what the  benefits  of  a

genuine  merger should be like. If an  amendment

is  necessary to define the type of  merger,  it

should include all the demands and all the terms

that  all  the Parties here want, and it  should

also  contain the interpretation and demands  of

everybody. Can you imagine the chaos, Sir, if we

all  start  putting  in amendments  on  what  we

particularly want to stress?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Sir, the only question

before the House in the motion is, do we  or  do

we not agree -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...that the first objective of all true

patriots  of  Malaya is to achieve  the  reunifi

cation of these two territories in a merger of

Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'.



<br><br>If  we do, let us vote for the motion. If we  do

not,  then  let us vote against it.  Or  is  the

Barisan  Sosialis saying that this House affirms

and  declares  that the first objective  of  all

true  patriots  of  Malaya  is  to  achieve  the

reunification  of  these two  territories  in  a

Barisan  Sosialis  type of merger?  Because,  in

effect,  that is what it is going to be if  that

amendment is

accepted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been quite a lot of legal

brains  talking on this amendment and the  whole

question  of merger from the legal aspect.  Some

philosophers  have offered philosophies  of  the

different types and theories of merger. Sir, may

I  take it from a psychological angle? In moving

the  motion,  I  presume that the  Minister  for

Labour hopes that the House will support him. In

asking for a genuine merger, I take it that  the

Member  for Queenstown hopes that the Federation

will grant it. And yet what do they do, Sir? The

Minister,  in hoping that we all - including  the

Barisan   Sosialis - will   support   him   starts

attacking the Barisan Sosialis, saying all sorts

of  things about them, hoping that by that means

he is going to get them to support him. I do not

understand the psychology of that, Sir. And then

the  Member for Queenstown, in trying to get the

Tunku  to  agree to a genuine merger,  says  all

sorts  of  things about him and his  Government.

The  Member  for  Nee Soon  no  doubt  tries  to

explain that in a democratic government  we  are

allowed to criticise, that he is not criticising

the  man but only what he and his Government are

doing. That is all very well, Sir, but I do  not

see   the  need  to  threaten.  The  Member  for

Queenstown wants to get merger from the Tunku by

telling  him  that  after a genuine  merger  the

Barisan  Sosialis will unite with the  Socialist

parties  in  the  Federation  to  overthrow  the

Tunku's  Government. I do not see the  logic  or

the  psychology of that, Sir. You want  a  thing

from  a person and yet you say to him, "Give  it

to  me so that I can do harm." If the Member for

Queenstown  is  going to ask  the  Minister  for

Labour  to  go for a drive with him so  that  he

will rob him,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>

I am sure he will not disclose it and say, "Look

here, Ahmad, come for a drive with me so that  I

can rob you when we reach a solitary place."  If

he  says that. I maintain that he is not serious

in  wanting the Minister to go with  him  for  a

drive. Probably he does not want the Minister to

go  and that is why he says that. The threat  is

put  there  to  deter the Minister  from  going.

Probably it is because the Member for Queenstown

is   meeting  his  girl  friend  down  there  or

probably even meeting someone whom he should not

meet.  I do not know. But the main idea is  that

by  saying that, the intention is not to get the

Minister  to come along. So I do not  quite  see

how by threatening -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order. The

hon. Member is imputing a very bad motive on  my

part! She says that I want to rob!

frivolous objection. Mrs Seow.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Thank you, Sir. As I have

said,  if you want something from a person,  you

do not get it by threatening him.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT CHINESE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SECONDARY IV EXAMINATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the net

of  merger closes on them, the Communist  cadres

are now falling

back on Chinese schools to whip up emotions and,

if  possible,  widespread chaos and  trouble  in

order  to stem the rising tide of merger.  Today

these  reckless and desperate Communist elements

mobilised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>

innocent  and  misinformed  school  children  to

picket  examination  centres  in  the  hope   of

intimidating those students who wished  to  take

the first Government Secondary IV Examination in

Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I emphasise here, Sir, that no student is

compelled  to take this examination?  All  those

who are taking this examination are doing so  of

their  own  free will and because their  parents

wish  them to do so. And it is the duty  of  the

Government, in a democratic country, to see that

no  student is denied the right to sit for  such

an  examination if he so wishes it  and  if  his

parents desire it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant that despite the intimi

dation  and picketing, about 1,900 students,  or

more  than 60 per cent of the students, sat  for

the examination. The so-called boycott organised

by Communist elements has not succeeded, but the

fact  that they have now been reduced  to  using

school children as pawns and expendable material

in  their  anti-merger campaign is  significant.

For   Chinese  schools,  Chinese  education  and

culture  have  often been their rallying  points

for  mustering innocent people to man  Communist

barricades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has reason to believe that these

Communist cadres, in their desperation, will now

incite  those innocent and misinformed  students

into resorting to more reckless and rougher

tactics.  The boycott was only incidentally,  to

prevent  students  from taking the  examination.

The real objective of the picketing was to force

a  clash  between  the  police  and  the  school

children  in the hope that some school  children

would  get  hurt, and in this way the Communists

can  use  such incidents to mount public feeling

against  the Government. It is typical of  these

Communist  leaders  that, in  order  to  achieve

their  ends,  they are ready to do  this  safely

behind  the  skirts  of school  children.  These

great  revolutionaries, not daring to  challenge

the  Government directly, are willing to  gamble

with the safety of children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government refused to fall into the

Communist  trap.  It allowed these  excited  and

misinformed students to picket schools  but  did

not  bring out the police. The result  was  that

not only was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

the  picketing  not a success but the  Communist

cadres  were denied the opportunity of provoking

a  clash between school children and the police.

However,  we  have reason to believe  that  they

will  try to force the situation by using  these

misinformed  school children to do things  which

would bring about violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examinations are scheduled for a week. All

indications are that the students will  be  used

to   precipitate  violence.  Plans   are   being

considered  by  these Communist  cadres  in  the

schools to get into the examination halls,  tear

up  examination papers, and force the candidates

to   disperse.  Squads  of  students  are  being

organised  and may visit the homes  of  students

who  are  taking the examination  to  intimidate

them  into abandoning the examinations. The real

objective is to force violence between  students

and police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government has steadfastly refused to

use the police in an educational issue which the

Government has allowed the Chinese educationists

themselves  to decide, the Communist cadres  who

are  behind  this  agitation are  becoming  more

determined  to force a clash between the  police

and  the  school children. They will go  to  any

lengths   between  now  and  the  end   of   the

examinations to achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

public,  the  misinformed school  children,  and

parents  to bear this in mind. It is significant

to  bear  in mind that this agitation in Chinese

schools  began only after the merger issue  came

to the forefront. It is only since then that the

cry  of  Chinese education being in  danger  was

raised.  No member of the public believed  this.

Even   the   Barisan  Socialis  representatives,

including my former Parliamentary Secretary, the

Member  for  Serangoon Gardens,  never  believed

this.  For  it is unlikely that they would  have

stayed  on  with the Government  which  for  two

years -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In a ministerial

statement, I do not think it is proper for  the

Minister  to  make  a statement  which  invites

debate. Mr Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Well, in fact, my former

Parliamentary  Secretary  defended   the   whole

system  before the Prime Minister.  It  is  only

since  they broke away from us on the  issue  of

merger that they have taken to making vague  and

unsubstantiated allegations that the  Government

is  not  treating Chinese education fairly.  The

current  agitation in schools is being organised

by  Communist  cadres. It is not an  educational

issue  but  a  political one - part  of  the  pro-Communist campaign to halt merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since June, when the pro-Communist elements

decided  to  challenge  the  Government  on  the

merger issue, the Communists have been straining

every  nerve  to  mobilise  forces  against  the

Government with a view to bringing it  down  and

sabotaging  merger. The attempt to  capture  the

Government  has failed. Their attempt  to  bring

down the Government by constitutional means  has

failed. Their attempt to capture the Party  from

within  has  failed. Their attempt  to  stir  up

strikes and precipitate -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr

Speaker, Sir,In a ministerial statement, is  it

proper  that  the  Minister  should  indulge  in

attacks of which we have heard a lot already?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To use a word which is often used

in  this Assembly and was used by the Member for

Anson,  I  have  indicated  that  a  ministerial

statement  should  be completely  dispassionate,

and  facts should be placed before the Assembly.

If  the  Minister thinks that the matter  is  of

such  importance that he requires a debate, then

there  is  a  procedural device.  He  moves  the

adjournment  of  the House, makes  a  statement,

Members are allowed to debate the statement, and

then at the end of the debate, the Minister asks

for  leave to withdraw that motion. That is  the

device  if, in fact, the Minister is inviting  a

debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a

statement that I wish to make because I think it

is a very topical issue and things will develop.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now we find that they are falling back on

Chinese  schools.  That  is  the  subject  I  am

talking   about.  It  is  a  measure  of   their

desperation that they must now try to  create  a

situation -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. I repeat

my point of order.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the Minister is

directly  attacking the Members of this Assembly

in  his statement. He is, I think, talking about

Communist cadres. If that is so, then he  is  in

order to carry on on that line, and on that line

alone.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Perhaps the Member for Anson

is not following what I say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the pro-C.P. elements. It is a

measure of their desperation that they must  now

try  to  create  a  situation  in  which  school

children can be pushed into violence so  that  a

few  children can get maimed and hurt while  the

great revolutionaries debate and incite children

from the safety of the Conference room.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I come to the Barisan Sosialis. They

are behind this desperate move too, because -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister wishes now

to attack the Barisan Sosialis, then I think the

fair  and  proper thing to do  is  to  move  the

adjournment of this Assembly so that there  will

be a debate on his statement. Mr Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Talking of the Barisan

Sosialis, on the one hand, they demand  complete

merger  including the application of the  Rahman

Talib education policy.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is now making

a  ministerial  statement. Now, if  he  makes  a

ministerial statement which attacks a  Party  or

individuals  in this House, then  it  is  proper

that  he should allow a debate on the statement.

As  I have indicated, the way to do that is  for

him  to move the adjournment of the House, allow

a debate to carry on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>

on  his statement, and at the end of the debate

ask  for leave to withdraw the motion. Then the

business of the House can go on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

prepared for a debate. So may I -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The time to move the

adjournment  is  at the end of  the  statement.

Perhaps the Minister will bear that in mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I will come back then.

Since  June when the pro-C.P. elements  decided

to  challenge  the  Government  on  the  merger

issue, the Communists have been straining every

nerve to mobilise forces against the Government

with  a view to bringing it down and sabotaging

merger. Their attempt to capture the Government

has  failed.  Their attempt to bring  down  the

Government by constitutional means has  failed.

Their  attempt to capture the Party from within

has  failed. Their attempt to stir  up  strikes

and  precipitate what their followers call  the

"October Revolution" has failed. Their

attempt to stir up revolt in the People's

Association has failed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now they are falling back on Chinese

schools.  It  is a measure of their desperation

that  they  must try to create a  situation  in

which  school  children  can  be  pushed   into

violence so that a few children can get  maimed

and   hurt,  while  the  great  revolutionaries

debate, and incite children from the safety  of

this Assembly or Conference Rooms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis leaders are behind these

desperate tactics up to their necks. They  hope

to achieve their aim of thwarting merger on the

injured  bodies of school children. On the  one

hand,  they  demand complete merger,  including

the  application of the Rahman Talib Report  on

Education,  which proCommunist  Party  elements

claim is detrimental to Chinese education. Yet,

on  the other hand, in their Party publication,

the  Barisan Sosialis - this is from the  Chinese

edition,  Sir - encourage students to oppose  and

boycott   the   examinations  by  giving   full

publicity  to the circular dated 17th November,1961,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>

purporting   to   be  issued   by   Student   Re

presentatives and/or Committees of  Ten  Chinese

Secondary   Schools,  which  gives  a  distorted

report  of  what  took  place  at  an  interview

between my Parliamentary Secretary and a student

delegation on 16th November, 1961. Further  evid

ence  that  the Barisan Sosialis and their  pro-Communist  mentors are behind this manoeuvre  to

bring about violent clashes between students and

police  can be seen from the role that Mr  Fong

Swee  Suan,  who is closely connected  with  the

Barisan   Sosialis  as  its  Central   Executive

Committee  member, is playing in this  dangerous

game,  dangerous  not  for  Mr  Fong  and   his

friends,  but for the school children they  have

duped  and  intimidated into doing  foolish  and

dangerous things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the posters and banners supporting the

boycott  and picketing are prominently displayed

on the buses of the Tay Koh Yat Bus, Company and

the  Paya Lebar Bus Company, the workers of whom

are  controlled by Mr Fong Swee  Suan  and  his

friends,  like  Mr  Chen  Saye  Jame   in   the

Singapore  Bus  Workers'  Union.  A  number   of

interested  personalities who  were  unconnected

with the students were observed at some of

the centres this morning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8.00 a.m. Lim Kee Chow, Assistant Secretary

of  the  Hock  Lee Branch of the  Singapore  Bus

Workers' Union, went among the picketers outside

the  Hwa  Yi  Government Chinese  Middle  School

talking to the picketers. At 8.35 a.m. Lim  Teow

Kuan, Vice-Chairman of the Paya Lebar Branch  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis,  and  two  friends  went

opposite  the entrance of the Chung Hwa  Girls'

High   School   in   Bartley   Road,   generally

supporting the picketers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about 9.00 a.m., Tommy Koh Thong Bee of the

University  of  Malaya Socialist  Club  faction,

which  supports the Barisan Sosialis, and  three

friends  visited  the centre at Whampoa  Chinese

Secondary School in St. George's Road. At  about 9.10 a.m. Koh Chee Kiong, a strike leader of the

People's Association, stopped at the entrance of

the  Chung  Hwa  Girls' High School  in  Bartley

Road,  stayed for a few minutes, giving  general

support to the pickets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did it all happen? For the past five months

Singapore  has  endured a period of  trials  and

tribulations  and a rash of strikes  because  in

June    1961,    certain    Communist-controlled

political  forces decided that  the  forthcoming

constitutional  talks  for independence  through

merger  between  Singapore  and  the  Federation

Government  were to be frustrated at  any  cost.

Secondary School system was first raised by some

members of the Chinese School Teachers' Union in

their  letter  to the Minister dated  9th  June,

1961.  At  the  height of the  controversy  some

individuals of the Nanyang University  Students'

Union  tried  to involve students by  announcing

their  intention  to convene a  meeting  of  all

monitors  of  Chinese secondary schools  at  the

Hokkien  Association on 9th August,  1961.  This

move  was  checked  when principals  refused  to

allow  their  students to  attend  the  meeting,

which was accordingly called off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th October, 1961, the 4:2 system

controversy  was  amicably  resolved  with   the

Chinese  Schools Committee-Teacher  Association,

an  organisation regarded by Chinese educational

bodies  themselves  as the highest  organisation

for Chinese education in Singapore. The Minister

agreed  to  their  request to  allow  those  who

failed  the  Government Secondary IV examination

but passed the internal school examination to be

promoted  to  upper secondary classes.  Then  on

15th   October,  1961,  the  Nanyang  University

Students'  Union issued a Press statement  which

stated  that  whilst they accepted in  principle

the   settlement  reached  with  the  Committee-Teacher  Association,  they  however  considered

that  the requirement that only those who passed

the Government Secondary IV examination can take

the  Government  Upper Secondary II  examination

was  "unreasonable" and should be withdrawn. The

first shot in a new controversy was fired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attempt to whip up agitation and draw

attention to themselves, these student agitators

held meetings in schools and resorted to acts of

hooliganism. They destroyed tables and chairs in

some schools; cut cables of the public address



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



system  in  order  to  prevent  Principals  from

speaking  to students. They went from  house  to

house  to  intimidate parents and  students  who

intended  to take the examination,  and  in  one

case  in  the. Chinese High School, they carried

away  the  gate  of the school.  They  also  dis

tributed  leaflets falsely giving the impression

that  the Government was out to destroy  Chinese

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15th November, 1961, a delegation of 19

students  (ten  boys and nine girls)  from  five

schools,  namely, Yock Eng, Chinese High,  Chung

Cheng, Chung Hwa Girls and the Nan Chiau, Girls'

High called at the Ministry of Education at  Kay

Siang Road at 2.30 p.m. to see the Minister. The

Minister was then in Kuala Lumpur attending  the

Colombo Plan Ministerial Conference. The student

delegation, however, returned to the Ministry of

Education the following day, 16th November,  and

whilst  the number of students was reduced  from

19   to   14,  the  school  representation   was

increased  from  5  to  7,  which  now  included

representatives from Sin Min High School and Seh

Chuan  High  School. This time, my Parliamentary

Secretary  decided  to see  them.  He  patiently

explained and answered their representations  as

follows.  Firstly, there could be no  change  to

the  Ministry's  decision that  only  those  who

passed  the  Government Secondary IV examination

can  take  the  Government  Upper  Secondary  II

examination. This is normal educational practice

anywhere in the world: that a person should pass

the  lower examination before proceeding to  the

higher  examination. Secondly, that the detailed

syllabuses of the Upper Secondary course will be

available  before  the end  of  the  month.  The

Parliamentary Secretary stressed that the  langu

age  medium of instruction would remain Chinese.

Thirdly, there is no intention or possibility of

using conversion to the 4: 2 system to eliminate

Chinese    education.   Fourthly,    when    the

Parliamentary  Secretary  asked  the  delegation

whether  they were going to boycott  the  Govern

ment examination, they all replied that they had

no such intention.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, although all Chinese secondary schools

had closed for the vacation after completion  of

the   year-end  school  examinations   on   20th

November, 1961, it was reported that 121  chairs

and  34  desks  were  found  to  be  maliciously

damaged in the Dunman Government Chinese  Middle

School, obviously with a view to preventing  the

school from being used for holding examinations.

On  the same day, it was reported that pamphlets

were  being  distributed  in  the  River  Valley

Government Chinese Middle School. The  same  day

the Chinese Schools Teachers Union also released

to  the Chinese Press the full contents of their

letter  addressed  to  the Minister  dated  13th

November  1961, stating that the requirement  to

restrict candidates taking the Government  Upper

Secondary II Examination to those who have first

passed  the  Government Secondary IV Examination

as "unreasonable".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st November, 1961, both the Sin Chew Jit

Poh and the Nanyang Siang Pau gave publicity to

the  text  of  a circular issued by  individual

school supervisors and/or principals of the  27

Chinese secondary schools explaining to parents

the  importance of the Government  Secondary  N

examination,   as  the  certificate   will   be

equivalent  to  the  present Government  Senior

Middle  III Certificate for purpose of  seeking

employment  in  the Government or  joining  the

Teachers' Training College or Polytechnic. This

circular  letter  also  pointed  out  that  the

Government Secondary IV examination was not com

pulsory and that it was left to the students to

take  or  not to take the examination.  Parents

were,   however,  advised  to  encourage  their

children  to take the examination for the  sake

of their own future and to bring their children

to the examination centres themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same day the Member for Queenstown (and

Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis) in moving the

amendment  to the motion on merger proposed  by

the  Minister  for Labour in this  House,  when

criticising  the Government's merger  proposals

to retain local autonomy in education, added (I

quote his words),



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>

"It  was  a path leading not to national  unity,

but  to national disunity and to war." Yet their

idea  of  complete mercer would  mean  that  the

Central Government's policy on education must be

followed  in Singapore. Even if the  Member  for

Queenstown makes out that he does not know about

this, the people of Singapore, particularly  the

Chinese-educated, know well that this would lead

to trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 22nd November, 1961, issue of the

Barisan  organ  of the Barisan Sosialis  Chinese

edition,   page   4,  there  appeared   a   full

reproduction of this circular issued by the  so-called Student Representatives and/or Committees

of  Ten Chinese Secondary Schools which gives  a

distorted report of the interview .given  by  my

Parliamentary   Secretary   to    the    student

delegation on 16th November referred to earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving publicity to the students' agitation,

which   no  responsible  Chinese  newspaper   in

Singapore had published, it became necessary for

Government to issue a statement the same day  to

alert  parents and guardians against  antisocial

agitators against the first Government Secondary

IV  examination in Chinese, and advised them  to

make  sure that their children are not  used  by

evil  political forces for their  own  political

ends,   which  has  nothing  to  do   with   the

advancement of education and the future  of  our

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explanation was necessary because of the

open  intervention in the matter by the  Barisan

Socialis.  The  statement also informed  parents

that   Chinese  secondary  schools  had  already

closed for vacation since Monday, 20th November,

1961,  at  the request of the school principals,

and  that  their  children need  not  return  to

school for the school examination results, which

would   be   posted  to  them  by  the   school

authorities.  Parents and  guardians  were  also

asked to advise their children to make full  use

of  the  holiday  period in the quiet  of  their

homes  to review and prepare for the forthcoming

Government examinations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, today, having failed to intimidate parents

and  students from taking the examinations (some

60 per cent of the students took the examination

today), the real leaders behind the student  agi

tation  will no doubt try very hard  to  disrupt

the  examinations. The students, the parents and

guardians  and  the Government can  help  defeat

this  attempt  to  intimidate them  by  ignoring

their  threats and peacefully going on with  the

examinations.   Parents   and   guardians    can

accompany   their  children  by  bringing   them

personally to the examination centres and out of

them.  Full facilities will be given to  parents

to  bring in food and drinks for themselves  and

their children, and suitable waiting rooms  will

be arranged for the parents while their children

are  taking the examinations. Further, those who

could  not take their examinations today because

of  intimidation by the pickets  can  start  the

examination from tomorrow. They will be given  a

substitute  paper  for the  subjects  they  have

missed today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also appeal to the misinformed students, who

have  become  excited over false allegations  of

the  killing  of Chinese education and  culture,

not  to  allow themselves to be used by men  who

have  no care for Chinese education as such,  or

for  the  welfare and happiness of the students.

They  have  publicly said that if they  can  get

automatic  conversion from Singapore citizenship

to  Federation citizenship for their own selfish

purposes  of  standing  for  election   in   the

Federation,   they  are  quite  happy   to   let

education   be  under  the  Central   Federation

Government   with   all  the   consequences   of

implementing the Rahman Talib Education  Report.

They  use these school children as pawns in  the

dangerous  political  game of  combating  merger

because  they dare not risk their own  necks  in

this dangerous game.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The position procedurally now is

this.  Members  are  at liberty  to  debate  the

statement  made  by the Minister  for  Education

until  8  p.m. At 8 p.m., if the motion has  not

been  disposed  of,  it  will  lapse,  and   the

Assembly will adjourn in the usual way.  If  the

matter  is  to be pursued further,  it  must  be

pursued  in the proper way by notice  of  motion

given either by the Minister or by any Member of

the  Opposition, or by another  motion  for  the

adjournment on another sitting day.



<br><br>6.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Minister for Education has given us  a

startling  statement  in some  respects.  I  can

fully understand his position in seeking to make

known  to  the  people  of  Singapore  what   he

believes  to be attempts to subvert  our  school

youth  to  improper political activities.  I  am

with  him  in  his  appeal that the  educational

authorities  should  have  the  support  of  the

parents, and the

information he has given as to the way they  can

give  that support. I can but regret for myself,

Sir, that it should

have  been found necessary that, instead of just

making that statement as a statement of fact  of

information and of appeal, he should have sought

to associate it - I mean, if he wants to

attack  them, I have no brief for them - not  only

with  an  attack upon his former  comrades,  but

also  with  the  merger  debate.  We  have   had

confusion enough on this issue. Instead of being

able  to  debate the White Paper alone, we  have

had  this  irrelevant merger motion brought  in,

and now we have this further confusion added.  I

cannot but regret that there is - you will forgive

me  if I say so, but I say quite honestly,  Sir,

one

gets  the impression that he is seeking to  make

capital  out  of  what is not  only  an  unhappy

position,  but  also for purposes  of  a  debate

which quite obviously is not

going too well for the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add one or two points, Sir. The

Minister had seen fit to mention the name  of  a

person  I  know  well - Tommy Koh Thong  Bee - in  a

context which suggests that he is a Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>

or  pro-Communist. I say to you, Sir, that I am

prepared to pledge my life that that man is  no

Communist; he is no pro-Communist, and he is no

running dog of the Communist. He is one of  the

finest human beings I have ever met, and I have

complete faith in his genuine dedication to the

democratic  processes as we  understand  it.  I

have had occasion, Sir, to watch that man daily

for  months, and I do say it is unfair, because

he  may have been seen somewhere near a school,

to  use  his name publicly in this Assembly  in

order to make suggestions of that character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only another small matter. I can see

that the Prime Minister is anxious to speak and

we will welcome what he has to say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am taking it down.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you. Sir, there is a

motion  before  the House for a  Commission  of

Inquiry  into education. Now, it seems  to  me,

Sir,  that  this allegation, if true - I  am  not

seeking to doubt it in saying if true. I am not

seeking  to  make any connotation  that  it  is

dishonest. I do not know, Sir. But  I  do  know

this  and  the public know this; that there  is

deep  hate between the P.A.P. and their  former

colleagues,  who  are now the Barisan  Sosialis

and  that  there  is  quite  naturally  now   a

tendency  to  take  with a pinch  of  salt  any

attacks  of this character - then I will  welcome

an  assurance from the Government benches  than

an  impartial  Commission of  Inquiry  will  be

appointed, because if there are human beings in

this  city  who  are subverting  our  youth  of

school   age  going  to  school  for   improper

political    purposes,   conduct    which    is

reprehensible,   then,  Sir,   we   want   that

information from an impartial tribunal, and  we

want  their  condemnation,  as  condemned  they

should be by an impartial tribunal -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Agreed!

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am very happy to hear it. I am

prepared to sit down if you wish.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, as I have already

indicated, I have often been accused of  wanting

to pillory people in Commissions of Inquiry, and

one  had been suggested for the People's Associa

tion which we readily accepted. I understand the

Member  for Anson is in correspondence with  the

Minister  for Labour on the terms of  reference.

Of  course,  the  terms  of  reference  must  be

sufficiently  wide  in our  view  to  include  a

complete and comprehensive survey of everything.

Similarly in this, the terms of reference of the

Commission of Inquiry to show how this issue has

been  built  up, and in particular in  the  last

stages,   their  connection  with  the   Barisan

Sosialis  and the real leaders - the real leaders,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, if you will forgive  me  for

using that phrase - who are in a position to  move

the  digits  on the chess-board. All Members  of

this  Assembly will have to waive their Assembly

privilege and be examined on oath.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much indebted, Mr Speaker,

Sir, to the Prime Minister. That is the fair and

proper way. I have nothing to add. I am happy by

this  assurance that there will be a  Commission

of  Inquiry into these so grave allegations  and

that   it   can  then  arrive  at  an  impartial

decision. Sir, let me assure the Prime  Minister

that  if,  in  fact, the Commission  of  Inquiry

finds that there are persons in this Assembly -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Outside this Assembly

manipulating those inside.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - within or without this Assembly,

who  have  conciously subverted and  manipulated

our  youth  for improper political  purposes,  I

will  be  with the Government 100  per  cent  in

their condemnation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we in the Barisan

Sosialis  have  been  accused  of  many  things.

Whenever   anything   goes   wrong   with    the

Government,  be  it in the unions  or  anywhere,

they  always  want to link it up  with  us,  the

whole  idea  being  to frighten  people  and  to

isolate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>

the  Barisan  Sosialis,  and  thereby  to  gain

strength for themselves. But as the Member  for

Anson  has  said, there is already a motion  in

the Order Paper which talks of a Commission  of

Inquiry on the education issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What about the connection

with the Barisan Sosialis?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If there is going to be a

Commission of Inquiry, let it be, and  we  will

all  support it. There need be no diversion  at

this juncture to debate something else, when we

have  all  our attention directed on to  merger

and  all  its implications which the Government

is trying to hide.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is that all?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand  this controversy over the  3:3  and

4:2 systems has been raging for many months.  I

think  it  has  been  raging  even  before  the

Barisan Sosialis was formed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Government accused the Barisan

Sosialis of fostering trouble on this issue and

the Member for Anson asked for a Commission  of

Inquiry  to  which the Government  has  agreed.

Perhaps when this Commission of Inquiry is  set

up,  it  will be able to put the picture  in  a

clearer  light  for  the  information  of   the

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps the Minister will also be able

to  tell us - because it was after my association

with  the P.A.P. - how this controversy over  the

3:3  and  4:2 systems came into being  and  who

were  the  persons involved in  advocating  the

present system. Give us a short summary of  how

it   all  happened.  Also  whether  his  former

Parliamentary Secretary endorsed it -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - and perhaps this will help

us   to  clear  the  air.  Sir,  I  think   the

Government's  suppression of the Press  in  not

publishing  news  and  views  on  this  subject

matter  of  the  3:3 and 4:2  systems  and  the

revolt  of  the students against these  systems

has  put a dim light on the whole picture. That

is why we were taken by surprise when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>

the Minister rose to deliver his statement just

now. Had there been no suppression of the Press,

I  feel that Members today would have been in  a

better  position  to  debate this  controversial

subject matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is the Member suggesting

that there should be a Commission of Inquiry  on

the  suppression of the Press? I am quite happy

to have one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Prime Minister did not do too well ire  the

first  Commission of Inquiry and I think he  is

just trying to put on a hold front. Sir, we will

be  having two Commissions -  one on the  People's

Association and the other on education.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Make it three.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I think the Prime Minister

knows there is suppression of the Press. He  has

said  that a responsible Press should not  print

news of students. It was only after the, Barisan

Sosialis  paper  printed  this  news  !hat   the

Government was forced to issue a reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we hope that the Minister will further

enlighten us as to how this controversy  started

and perhaps the Commission of Inquiry, when duly

appointed,  will be able to throw further  light

on the subject.

<br><br>6.20 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, speaking

for  myself and for the Alliance, I am  indebted

to  the Minister for having made this statement,

because quite a lot of a were not quite sure  as

to  what was happening in the educational field,

particularly the Chinese educational field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not pretend to he any

sort  of  an  expert on education,  particularly

Chinese  education,  but  the  Members  of   the

Alliance  and I are interested in the  youth  of

this country,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>

be  they  Chinese, Malays, Indians or  he  they

anyone       We  expect certain behaviour  from

the youth of this country certain conformity to

certain  social patterns which  are  not  anti-State.  It is not for me, Mr Speaker, Sir,  to

go  into the merits or demerits of this  little

controversy. The Commission of Inquiry will  go

into  that  and set the whop problem in  proper

focus  and in its proper perspective. But  what

staggers  me,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is  this.  The

Member  for  Anson, speaking on behalf  of  the

Workers' Party, has had his say. The leader  of

the  newlyformed Barisan Sosialis has  had  his

say.  The Member for Hong Lim has had his  say.

The   three  major  political  Parties  sitting

behind the Alliance Members have had their say.

But  what  interests me, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  is

that  nobody  seems to he interested  in  these

Chinese   kids  who  are  sitting   for   their

examinations. Not one of them has mentioned the

kids here in this Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> All that they are interested in are

the political implications of the situation and

not  in what is going to happen to these  kids.

We understand that the kids are being prevented

from  sitting for an examination. Sir, I  would

like to hear somebody from the Barisan Sosialis

say  publicly  here that  they  say  to  the

parents  and  to  the children  to  go  to  4he

examinations without fear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> We from the Alliance say it, Sir,

and I would like them from behind us to say  it

too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Quite right. Thirteen of them

too.

<br><br>6.25 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister for Education has made a report to

this House giving details of student agitators.

He  has also pointed out that the organ of  the

Barisan  Sosialis has published a statement  on

the  students. In this statement,  it  is  seen

clearly that the meeting between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>

students'   delegation  and  myself   has   been

distorted. The former Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister  for Education  and  I  have  been

seeing  each other here almost :very day  during

the  period  of  this sitting.  If  the  Barisan

Sosialis  really want to find out the truth  and

the  details  regarding this question  from  the

Government, they can come forward or, a friendly

basis  and  ask  us what it is all  about.  They

should  not  have  published a  statement  which

distorted the facts in their party organ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual truth is this. I heard the former

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Education say that this

question  of the 4:2 and 3:3 systems  should  be

brought up before the Prime. Minister and  other

Members  for consultation. If there was anything

wrong  with  this  4:2  system  he  should  have

brought  up this question earlier and  tried  to

find  a way out. But unfortunately this question

was  only brought up after the 13 Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis had left, the P.A.P.  We  know

that  teachers'  organisations  and  educational

bodies  have given their valuable views on  this

system and we have sincerely considered them. We

have  met representatives off teachers  and  the

Board  of  Directors and we have accepted  their

proposals  and  suggestions.  In  one  of  their

proposals they stated that they were afraid that

the  4:2  system  would reduce  the  period  for

middle  school students from six to four  years.

At that time, the Ministry of Education's ruling

Was  that  students  who failed  the  Middle  IV

examination  would  not be  promoted.  For  this

reason, the educational bodies were afraid  that

the  period for middle school students would  be

reduced  from  six to four years.  In  order  to

avoid  any  misunderstanding, we accepted  their

views,  that  is, all students  who  pass  their

school examinations internally would be promoted

together  with those who pass the Government  ex

aminations.   That  was  a  special   concession

because, in English schools, if a student should

fail the School Certificate Examination he would

not  dream  of  sitting for  the  Higher  School

Certificate Examination, and even those who pass

the School Certificate Examination



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>

must have at least three Credits before they can

sit  for  the H.S.C. Examination. In the Chinese

schools  those who fait the public  examinations

but  pass  the  school  examinations  could   be

promoted to higher classes. In this case, we are

making  a  very special concession by  accepting

the  opinion  of  the  educational  bodies.  The

representatives  of  Chinese  school   teachers,

directors,  and  committee  teachers  have   put

forward  a  suggestion that those  students  who

have  failed the Middle IV examination can  only

sit for the Upper Secondary II examination after

a supplementary examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if we accept the proposal of the, students,

that would mean that if we fail the Malay Std. I

examination we can even sit for the  Malay  Std.

II  examination. That would also mean that  even

if we fail the School Certificate examination we

can   sit  for  the  Higher  School  Certificate

examination. This would cause great confusion in

the   education  system.  Therefore,   in   this

respect, when the student representatives met me

(I  spent almost an hour with them), I explained

to  them patiently, and I believe I never showed

anger  before  the  students.  After  the   talk

lasting for about an hour, I opened the door and

let them out one by one. Was that not courteous?

I  do  not know what courtesy means if that  was

not so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the questions they brought up, I explained

to  them  that,  firstly,  the  cancellation  of

certain restrictions, that is to say, that those

who  have  failed the Secondary  IV  examination

will  be  allowed to sit for the Upper Secondary

II  examination, is unreasonable. If we accepted

this,  it  would mean that examinations  do  not

exist  in  the education system. Secondly,  they

asked  me  whether it was the intention  of  the

Government  to  use  English  as  a  medium   of

instruction in place of Chinese. I assured  them

that  the  Government had no such intention.  We

will  never use English instead of Chinese as  a

medium   of  instruction  in  Chinese   schools.

Regarding  the  curriculum  and  syllabus,  they

asked me when the Government is going to publish

details of the syllabus. I told them it would be

done soon. When I refused to accede to their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>

demands,  one of the representatives accused  me

of  having  an  intention to  eliminate  Chinese

education. I told them that I myself came from a

Chinese school and that some of my children  are

in   Chinese  schools,  and  that  it  would  be

nonsense  for  me to say that  I  am  trying  to

eliminate   Chinese  education.  I   told   them

carefully and courteously, "Is there any country

in South-East Asia in which Chinese education is

so  well  developed and so free to take its  own

course?"  And I also told them that  if  at  all

Chinese   education  should  be  eliminated   in

future, it would be they who would do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a statement published in the organ of the

Barisan   Sosialis,  the  meeting  between   the

representatives and me was distorted. This organ

of  the  Barisan Sosialis should have  clarified

the   whole,   situation  before  publishing   a

statement. In the statement, it is said that

the Parliamentary Secretary rejected the claims,

and turned his face against the reasonable talks

about this claim.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Parliamentary Secretary was quoting,  he  should

point  out that the statement was given  by  the

students,  so as not to give a false  impression

to the people. This was not what was said by the

Barisan Sosialis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Member for Upper Serangoon has  reason

to doubt the statement published in the paper. I

am also very happy to know that the organ of the

Barisan   Sosialis  has  made   a   mistake   in

publishing this statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking of the statement published in the

organ  of  the Barisan Sosialis. May I  continue

quoting?  "What we are against is that  the  4:2

system  should not be used to sieve out  Chinese

students,  and we say that this is a  stumbling-block  to the development of Chinese education."

This  statement continues to say that if,  after

reformation,  English is used  as  a  medium  of

instruction in Chinese schools, then it will  be

a   clear   step  taken  to  eliminate   Chinese

education. You will see, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that

during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>

the  meeting  I told them clearly  and  assured

them that there would be no such thing as using

English  as a medium of instruction in  Chinese

schools. But they said so in their statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is another point. A report in the

organ  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  says  that  a

reporter  of the organ interviewed the students

and  he noted that there were many slogans  and

bills posted in the schools and canteens. These

posters  urged the Government to  withdraw  the

restriction. This means that the organ  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis has sent a reporter to  visit

the  schools and the people. The last paragraph

of  this  statement says that there  were  some

slogans  saying, "We must steadfastly safeguard

the  students  of Chinese schools  and  Chinese

education. Students! Students! We must not be

afraid of storm and rain! The Chinese students

want  to  speak  their  minds.  There  will  be

flowers blooming in Chinese education."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to waste any more time on this

statement,  Mr Speaker, Sir. The Minister  for

Education  has  said that these  students  have

some   connection  with  the  Barisan  Sosialis

because of this Press report. We feel that  any

responsible paper should not publish at  random

a  statement  of students without  making  sure

about it or consulting the Ministry

of   Education.  Therefore,  the  situation  it

present  is very sad to many of us, because  in

Singapore, students in Chinese schools can  sit

for  public  examinations using  Chinese  as  a

language to answer questions. We know that this

does not exist in the Federation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have noted that irresponsible politicians

are  now trying to exploit students and agitate

them  to boycott the examinations. They  accuse

us of not allowing students who have failed the

Secondary  IV examination to sit for the  Upper

Secondary  H  examination. We  have  said  that

there  is  no  country in the world  that  will

allow  such a thing to happen, i.e.,  to  allow

those who have failed in a lower examination to

sit  for  a  higher examination.  Any  rational

people will not dream of such a thing. I  would

like  to find out what are the views of Members

of the Barisan Sosialis on this matter. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>

cannot  make use of this as an excuse to agitate

students to boycott the examination. They cannot

make  use of this as an excuse to say that  this

is a move of the Government to eliminate Chinese

education. It would be ridiculous if  they  said

so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the student representatives met me, they

said that they represented all the Senior Middle

II,  III and Secondary IV students in Singapore.

I  told them that that might not be so. I  asked

them,   "Are  you  sure  all  the  students   in

Secondary   IV   classes   will   boycott    the

examination?"  They said that  there  were  some

1,900  students who were not afraid of them  and

they  went to sit for their examinations  today.

That means to say that these representatives did

not  tell  the  truth when they said  that  they

represented  all the students in  Singapore.  It

has been proved that the agitators are only some

of  the  students  who have  been  exploited  by

politicians  whose aim is to create trouble  and

chaos,  so  that  the  people  in  general  will

believe  that this Government has the  intention

to destroy Chinese education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the statement given by the

students'  representatives. It is a  very  funny

statement - the  so-called Secondary  IV  Students

Conference Pro-tem Committee. Somebody will come

to  the meeting and then another will second it.

Let us read a few paragraphs of the statement:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All these students in Chinese Secondary

IV classes are young people who are loyal to

Chinese education. In order to safeguard

Chinese education, in order to see that Chinese

education is not destroyed, we come forward

firmly to defeat all those who are trying to do

harm to Chinese education. Our parents

have,  by  difficult means sent  us  to  Chinese

Schools  to receive education. Our teachers  are

trying their best to educate us. So in order

not to disappoint the goodwill and well wishes

of the parents and teachers, we swear that we

want to be fighters of our education.'

<br><br>Then  there  is  the slogan "Long live  national

education! Long live Chinese education!"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another statement sent out by the Pro-tem

Committee  of the Students body is addressed  to

parents. It is stated there:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dear parents,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are trying your best to educate us by

sending  us to Chinese schools to have  a  good

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do so only for the sake that we will in

future be useful to society.'

<br><br>And  later  on,  it is stated in their  circular

that  the students believe that the parents will

not  like the students to sit for this Secondary

IV  examination, which is, they  say,  means  to

destroy Chinese education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave your indulgence by

touching upon the speech made by the Member  for

Queenstown.  They  want to  have  the  so-called

complete merger, that is to say, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

could touch upon that when we come to the debate

proper.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  hope that the representatives  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis will show their stand here  in

regard  to  the  boycott of the  examination.  I

would like to know what their views are on  this

boycott  of the examination. If they  show  that

they have nothing to do with the boycott of  the

examination, then I hope

they will appeal to the parents to bring their

children to sit for the examination.



<br><br>5.49 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   just   now   I  heard  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for  Education  make

certain accusations against the Barisan Sosialis

Members in this House. He said that the organ of

the Barisan Sosialis published a statement given

by  the students. I feel very surprised at  this

because  the present Parliamentary Secretary  to

the   Minister  for  Education  was  the  former

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Culture. He was in charge of news, and he was at

one  time  a  reporter himself. I  just  do  not

understand   his   lack  of  general   knowledge

regarding the publication of news.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody knows that to

publish  an item of news does not mean  that  we

are  sympathetic towards its contents. News  may

be  published in papers regarding riots in South

Korea,  but it does not mean that the editor  of

those papers is sympathetic to or agree with the

riots. I am now the Editor-in-chief of the Party

organ. In the past, I was Editor-in-chief of the

Chinese edition of the Petir - the Party organ of

the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was responsible for the

publication of this P.A.P. organ. I  would  like

to  quote an article on 14th August, 1958, about

the  trade union movement. In this article there

was  a  statement on strikes issued by the trade

unions.  It does not mean that at that time  the

P.A.P. was in sympathy with the strikes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on 27th June, 1958, there was

report  of  a  strike  in  the  Singapore  Glass

Factory.  Does that mean also that at that  time

the P.A.P. was in full sympathy with the workers

of   the   Glass   Factory  in   their   strike?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Prime Minister has interjected

in Mandarin!

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suppose any Member can

interject  in any language. But the  trouble  is

that   the   interpreter  might  not   get   the

interjection.    If    the    interjection    is

unparliamentary, I ask Members to get  up  on  a

point of order and indicate to the Speaker  what

the interjection is about. Mr Chan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was just

saying  that  I  am the Editor-in-chief  of  the

Party  organ of the Barisan Socialis.  When  the

reporter of this paper asked me whether I should

publish  this  item  of news,  I  considered  it

carefully  because I know that the  question  of

Chinese education is a very delicate one. When I

was  in  the P.A.P. I had a feeling that the  po

licy  of  the P.A.P. on Chinese education  might

lead  to  some trouble. Therefore,  when  I  was

confronted  with this item of news,  I  felt  it

necessary to publish the opinion of the students

themselves for the benefit of the public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>

The  main reason was that all the Chinese papers

as well as the English papers said nothing about

the students in this matter. Therefore, from the

point  of  news  and the Press,  it  was  a  bad

situation.  We  see some Members in  this  House

such  as the Member for Hong Lim and the  Member

for  Anson, do not know the full story about the

situation. I only came to know about it when the

students sent me their statement. So I  came  to

know  that  there must be something wrong  about

this matter, and I felt that it was correct  for

me  to  publish such an item of news. Therefore,

in our paper, we published the

statement issued by the students which was

suppressed by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Education said just now that the boycott  of

the examination by students came as a result  of

agitation by the Barisan Sosialis. I would  like

to  ask  them this. In the time of the  Lim  Yew

Hock  Government,  there were also  boycotts  of

public  examinations,  and  at  that  time   the

present Prime Minister was the legal adviser  to

the students' organisation. Does that mean that,

as legal adviser, the Prime Minister was at that

time sympathetic to the action of the students?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. I never throw away

bouquets which are thrown at me. But if I really

do  not deserve one, as in this case, then I  do

not  think I should be given one. I was not  the

legal adviser to the students union in 1953.  As

I have

explained in my radio broadcast, I came to  know

them  in 1954, through the famous King George  V

Park  incident. An unnecessary tribute was  paid

to me, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a point of clarification,

not a point of order. Mr Chan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think it is

better  for the Prime Minister himself  to  look

back  the  old copies of the newspapers  to  see

whether  it  was after or before the dissolution

of the Chinese Students Union.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at a Barisan Sosialis Central

Committee   meeting,  some   Central   Executive

members brought up some questions and said  that

there   was  some  unrest  among  the  students,

because everyone of us here had received a state

ment from the students. Therefore, we considered

carefully  what attitude we must  adopt  towards

this  matter. We felt that before  we  knew  the

whole  truth, it would be better for us  not  to

make any decision just yet. In the course of dis

cussion, some Committee members asked whether we

should  issue a statement on the reformation  of

Chinese  secondary education. When we considered

it, we felt it was not proper for us to issue  a

statement.  We  felt that if we should  issue  a

statement asking the students to sit for or  not

to  sit  for the examination, then we  would  be

giving the Government a chance to accuse  us  of

doing things behind the scenes. We know that  we

are  now  in  such  a  situation  that  whatever

happens,  whether  it be some unrest  or  strike

that takes place, we may be accused of being the

agitators. I personally believe that if some  of

the  leaders  in  the  City Council  strike  had

happened  to  be  leaders  and  members  of  the

Barisan Sosialis, we would have been accused  of

creating  social  unrest and be  again  detained

under   the  Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on the question of students and

education, we decided to be very careful  before

issuing any statement -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the

Barisan  Sosialis wants to find  out  the  whole

truth, how is it that their Party organ did  not

find  out the news regarding the principals  and

the teachers themselves?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  have  never  published  any  editorial

regarding the matter of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>

the  students in our Party organ. That means  to

say  that  we  are very careful in our  attitude

towards  this matter, so that it will  not  give

the Party in power an excuse to do us harm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very clear about the cause and origin of

this matter. I will briefly outline the cause of

this  unrest for the benefit of the  Members  in

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole question arose when the Government

tried   to   change   the  six-year   secondary

education  in Chinese into a four-year  system.

On  one  occasion, the Minister  for  Education

said in this House that the Government did  not

have  the so-called four-year system in Chinese

education.  The Minister was not very  truthful

about it. As far as I know, the P.A.P. actually

did  not want to implement the 4:2 system. What

it   wanted  to  implement  was  the  four-year

system,  to  reduce  the  number  of  years  of

Chinese secondary education by two years, i.e.,

from that of six years to four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Chinese pamphlet issued by the

Ministry  of  Culture,  wherein  is  the  policy

speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for  1960.

[Indicating] It was delivered in this  House  on

the 20th of July, 1960. There was one section in

the  speech  on education. It is at page  22  of

this  pamphlet.  It states that,  based  on  the

principle of equal treatment, the Government has

taken  steps to unify all the education  systems

of  the  different languages. Primary  education

has  a  six-year system. In the  final  year  of

primary education, students will have to sit for

a school - leaving examination. This public examin

ation will be held for the first time this year.

The  number of years of secondary education will

also be unified into that of a four-year system.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, let me repeat this. Secondary

education will have a unified four-year  system.

It has not been stated that it is going to be  a

4:  2  system. In this statement, it  is  stated

that  it  is the objective of the Government  to

have  a  common  examination  in  all  the  four

streams of education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, will you please refer to

Vol. 13 of our Hansard -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of order. The

Member  for Upper Serangoon is referring to  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech  for  1961.  It

would be fair, I think, that he should quote the

whole paragraph rather than just read a sentence

and stop there. It is true that mention was made

that  the  period of secondary school  education

would also be uniform, i.e., four years. Then he

should  go  on - Malay  and Tamil  schools  having

secondary school classes for the first time this

year.  I  mean,  he should do  that  to  give  a

correct picture. Then there is the further  two-year  additional Upper Secondary education which

is  not referred to in this instance, because we

do not talk of Upper Secondary education when we

are beginning with the Lower Secondary education

for the first time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I ask the Minister for Education to  point

out  where the Government has stated there is  a

4: 2 system. In 1960 -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have allowed the hon.

Member  to  carry on up till now but  I  do  not

think he should go into a detailed debate on the

4:2 system and the 4-year system. That can come,

if he is interested, in a motion notice of which

he could give in the proper way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   let  me  say  briefly  how  events   have

developed. The P.A.P. Government is implementing

the  reformation introduced by the Lim Yew  Hock

Government in respect of Chinese education.  Why

is  it  that  it is only this year that  Chinese

education    circles   have   expressed    their

dissatisfaction? It is because  from  next  year

onwards, Chinese secondary schools will not have

Senior  III  and Senior II like the old  scheme.

There   will   be  no  more  of  such   classes.

Therefore,  many  students  will  be  facing   a

situation where they will have no more chance of

studying in Senior II and III. Chinese education

circles   have  also  expressed  dissatisfaction

about this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, I pointed this out to the

Prime   Minister   when   I   was   still    his

Parliamentary  Secretary. I asked  him  why  the

Government   wanted   to  change   the   Chinese

secondary education system,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>

and  why  the Government had not consulted  the

Parliamentary Secretaries before such an action

was  taken.  The Parliamentary Secretaries  met

and  wrote  a letter addressed to the  Minister

for

Education. I later received a very long letter

from the Minister for Education

labelled  "Confidential".  It  accused  me   of

raising this point in my letter and also blamed

me for writing such a letter. If the disclosure

of  this  letter, which is the reply  from  the

Minister,   will  not  make   me   liable   for

committing   an  offence  under  the   Official

Secrets  Act, I will be very glad  to  disclose

its contents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

he is -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way. The

Member will not give way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> He asked for my permission

to release a confidential letter.

I am prepared -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I can

allow  all these details to be pursued. If  the

Member is interested in an all-out debate, then

I  think  the  proper way is for  him  to  give

notice of a motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Because the

Party  in  power  just now has  accused  us  of

certain  things, therefore, I feel it necessary

to  disclose all the things in the  past  which

have  led up to the present. I do not  want  to

say  too much. I only wish that you will permit

me  to  say  something so that the public  will

have full knowledge of this.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has said enough

to indicate that the Minister's allegations are

not  as correct as lie thinks they ought to be.

I  think  we  ought  to be  content  with  that

position.  As I say, if the hon. Member  wishes

to  pursue  the matter further, he should  give

notice of a substantive motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  let me point out here the dissatisfaction

of  the educational circles. It is because  the

Government is not prepared to conduct the post-secondary  classes. Therefore, when accused  by

the  educational circles, the Government  said,

"All right, you can carry on with your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>

2-year  post-senior secondary  classes."  Before

the  publication of syllabuses,  the  Government

had  not  done  so. Therefore, the students  are

very  concerned over their future schooling  and

the  kind  of textbooks they will be using.  The

dissatisfaction among the students is the result

of bad handling of the matter by the Government;

in other words, because of the wrong attitude or

stand taken by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state once more that we are not aware of

the  whole  truth  of  what has  been  disclosed

today. We do not quite understand the actions of

the students. That is why we want to reserve our

criticisms in regard to this matter raised today

[Interruption].

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister will have an

opportunity  of  speaking after the  Member  has

stopped. Mr Chan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Let me state

once  more  that this matter can be investigated

by  the  Commission of Inquiry. We  welcome  the

Government  to do so. The result of the  investi

gation  by the Commission of Inquiry will enable

the people of Singapore to know the full facts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first, let me explain why I must speak  in

Mandarin   to   reply  to  the  accusations   of

Opposition Members. We all know that the racial,

education  and  language problems are - as  pointed

out  by my ex-Parliamentary Secretary - very acute

and  delicate questions. The Opposition  Members

have spoken in Mandarin and they claim that they

want  to safeguard Chinese education. If I  were

to speak in English, then there would be rumours

outside -

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> On a point of order. This

allegation  of  the  Prime  Minister   is   most

inappropriate, because it was the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for  Education  who

started  speaking in Mandarin. He  is  a  better

speaker in English than in Mandarin. The  Member

for  Upper  Serangoon has all  along  spoken  in

Mandarin  in this House. So it is quite improper

to say that we are using a language to bamboozle

the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister said that

the  Opposition  Members are using  Mandarin  to

bamboozle  the  people,  then  I  think  he  was

unparliamentary. He must not impute an  improper

motive like that. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that was said by the Member for  Nee  Soon

himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ex-Parliamentary Secretary has made some

progress in learning the national language, that

is,   Malay.  But  because  he  is  now  in  the

Opposition he, together with the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang and others, always speaks in Mandarin.

Even  the  Member for Geylang Serai  feels  that

there is something communalistic -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  can  we ask whether we have the  right  to

speak in Mandarin?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. I was on the point of rising

to  ask  the Prime Minister to get on  with  his

speech, because any Member is entitled to  speak

in   any  of  the  four  languages  without  any

question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): That is a

matter  of  course. That is  why,  in  order  to

safeguard  the  right  of  speech  in  the  four

languages,  we  have  provided  in  the  merger

proposals  for Members of the State Assembly  to

speak   in  any  language  they  wish  to.   The

reactions  of  those outside this House  and  of

Members   inside   this   House   are   entirely

different. Of course, they understand this  full

well, because they have been trained by us.  The

main  question  is  the  reaction  outside  this

House.  So  we must let the people of  Singapore

know  that although some of my colleagues and  I

have  been  educated in English we are  in  full

support    of   Chinese   education   and    its

development,  as  well as  of  Malay  and  Tamil

education.  I have not been able to learn  Tamil

as this requires time and ability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask a very simple question. Has the

Barisan Sosialis got any stand on the boycott of

the  examinations by Chinese students?  Although

the  Member  for  Farrer  Park,  who  speaks  in

English,  does  not  understand  full  well  the

political  problem - the  Chinese-educated  think

the   English-educated  do  not  understand  the

political problem - he knows that basically it is

a  question of attitude: whether you support  or

are  against  this boycott of the  examinations.

The  question  is whether you like  to  see  the

future  of  some  3,000  students  spoilt  by  a

majority of people, and whether they are to have

equal opportunities with others in education  so

that they can serve the State. We have not heard

anything  about  this from  two  great  men - the

President of the Barisan Sosialis and a  Central

Executive Committee member. I feel we must  look

clearly  at the situation today. The  debate  on

this matter today is incidental. As a matter  of

courtesy,  at 5.30 p.m. today, the Minister  for

Education  had to inform the representatives  of

the people in this House as to what is happening

in  Singapore.  He will then inform  the  people

about  the situation through the newspapers  and

the  radio. He has done so in this House  purely

as  a  matter of courtesy. The Barisan  Sosialis

said  that  this was unreasonable and that  they

wanted a debate on this. So we accepted at  once

the motion for this debate.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I had better put the

record  straight. The motion for the adjournment

was  suggested  from the Chair as  a  procedural

device  in  order  that all  opinions  could  be

expressed on this statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  must therefore thank you  for  such  a

suggestion because, by having a free  debate  on

this matter, all those inside this House and the

people   outside   will  see  clearly   in   the

newspapers that the 13 Members of the Barisan So

sialis  have  said  nothing  on  this  important

matter.   They  have  only  uttered  some   Live

sentences  about this matter. I have  calculated

that  carefully. Actually they  can  speak  very

well  if they have speeches written out for them

by people behind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>

the scenes. They can then go on talking for some

seven  hours. We really admire the  energy  they

have  spent  on their speeches. Their  tone  was

different.  But all of a sudden,  without  their

backseat drivers, they cannot make a clear stand

on this important matter. We can now clearly see

that  it was the Editor-in-chief of their  Party

organ - he  was not the Editor-in-chief  of  the

P.A.P. organ  but only one of the  editors - who

was  quite eloquent. But what has he said?  Has

he  touched on the main question of the  boycott

of the examination? What is the attitude of the

Barisan  Sosialis  towards the  boycott  of  the

examination? Do they want some 3,000 students to

lose their chances in education? Or do they want

to  take  advantage of the situation  to  create

trouble  and confusion? I feel that tonight  we

must hear the ex-Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister for Education, because, in my view, his

attitude  towards this matter is very important.

When we came into power, I told my Minister  for

Education  that he was educated in  English  and

that, therefore, his Parliamentary Secretary had

to be one who was educated in Chinese or, if pos

sible, one who had been a Chinese teacher  or  a

Chinese school principal. In this way, he  would

have  somebody  who knew Chinese education  full

well  to  assist  him.  So  questions  regarding

Chinese education must be referred to the Member

for  Upper Serangoon. His opinion must be valued

because  he  is an expert. What is  the  result?

Regarding the 4:2 system and the 3:3 system,  we

had   a   meeting   one  day  of   Parliamentary

Secretaries.   That  was  not   a   confidential

meeting.  We had a very open meeting. We  had  a

very open talk about matters - [Interruption].  I

am  sorry - ex-Parliamentary Secretaries. My  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary asked me,  when  I  was

Chairman   of   the  Parliamentary  Secretaries'

meeting,  "Why  has the 3:3  system  got  to  be

changed  to  the 4:2 system without letting  the

people  know beforehand of its contents and  its

aim?"  Therefore, I entrusted this Question  to

my  Education  Minister and his ex-Parliamentary

Secretary  for them to explain to the Parliamentary  Secretaries what it was all about. It  was

very simple. There was no problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>

at  all. This was a decision made years ago.  He

never  said  anything about Lim Yew Hock.  I  am

just  repeating what he said. I do not  remember

whether he said anything about the Lim Yew  Hock

Government. He said there was nothing wrong with

it.  The  contents were not changed. The  system

was  only  aimed  at giving the Chinese  schools

equal  status so that they would have four years

of  secondary education and two years  of  post-secondary  education, which is the same  as  the

School   Certificate  and  the   Higher   School

Certificate  examinations  in  English  schools.

They  are  all  the  same.  Therefore,  my   ex-Parliamentary   Secretary   said,    "I    never

criticised  the contents of the  system.  All  I

want to know is why were we not consulted before

this matter was brought up?" So when I heard him

say that the P.A.P. had two failings - one of them

was about the handling of the matter - then I knew

he  was not a sincere man. He is denying what he

had  said. Then he added that he was criticising

the Government for having taken a wrong stand on

education.  It  is very strange.  When  has  the

stand  of  the Government become wrong?  Was  it

after  the  Hong  Lim or Anson  by-election?  In

fact, this matter took place before these two by-elections. It is very strange that before he was

expelled from the Party, he said nothing to  the

effect  that our education policy was  basically

wrong. It is only today that in his eloquence he

says  all of a sudden that we are wrong  in  our

stand  on education. Wrong in our stand? How  is

it  that  at that meeting he did not review  our

stand? How is it that he said nothing about  our

education policy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that today we should spend some time on

the question of the 3 : 3 and 4: 2 systems. Just

now  my  ex-Parliamentary Secretary said that  I

had   close  association  with  Chinese   school

students in the past. This question is  not  one

of  education,  but of students.  They  are  two

different  questions.  When  the  4:2  and   3:3

systems  became a delicate problem, the teachers

held  a  meeting  at  the  Happy  World  Stadium

sometime in August this year - I think it  was  on

29th  August.  At  that time I showed  them  the

stand of the Government on Chinese education and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>

Chinese  education policy, that  the  policy  on

Chinese education must be decided by the Chinese

schools themselves. It was not to be decided  by

us.  It  was  our responsibility to  give  equal

treatment  to  the  four streams  of  education.

Therefore, we brought up this question  for  the

decision  of the Chinese schools themselves.  We

must  see clearly that although this 4:2  system

has been brought up by the Government itself, he

final decision still lies with the principals of

Chinese secondary schools. They can only come to

a  decision after consultation among themselves.

Therefore,  it is not so easy for them  to  give

trouble.  Many  of the teachers  and  principals

support  the 4:2 system which they have  decided

to  adopt. We have not decided whether we should

adopt  the  4:2  system. We are  only  making  a

proposal. That is the first problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is the boycotting of the

examinations.  If  today the Government  is  not

careful in handling this question rationally and

try to solve the conflict between the people  by

way  of  persuasion,  then  there  may  be  some

trouble.  If  we  were just  like  the  colonial

government which resorted very easily to  police

and  other  actions, then there could very  well

have  been trouble. And if there should  be  any

trouble,  then  there would be casualties  among

the  students. Then we would be accused of being

merciless and relentless. So we decided to  have

this  matter determined by the students and  the

parents themselves. We do not force the students

to  sit for this public examination. We only say

that  this is a step taken to help the  students

to  have a good future. If they do not like  it,

well, they can leave it. We cannot use force  to

deal  with  questions  such  as  education   and

language. Therefore, the students' boycott today - I will not say it is actually a boycott, because

some students took the examinations and some  of

them  might  be unwell and therefore  failed  to

turn up because of this - so it does not mean that

these  students too are boycotting examinations.

It  is  our  responsibility to let them  have  a

chance  to decide whether they want to  sit  for

the   examinations  or  not.  But  it   is   the

responsibility    of   the   Barisan    Sosialis - [Interruption].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for

Queenstown wishes to interject, the way to do it

is  to  stand  up  and  see  whether  the  Prime

Minister will give way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Well, I will

give way and see what he has to say.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Queenstown

wish to take advantage of that?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I say that whatever they

have done, they want other people to carry their

baby.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Then I must

make  it  clear that the boycott does  not  mean

that it is a method employed only by the Barisan

Sosialis. Even long before this boycott  of  the

examinations  took place, as stated  by  my  ex-Parliamentary Secretary, I am only accusing  the

back-seat  drivers of the Barisan  Sosialis  for

having  some connection, and therefore I welcome

the  suggestion  of  the  Member  for  Anson  to

establish a Commission of Inquiry first, to look

into  the  trouble as a result of the change  of

the  3:3 system to 4:2; and second, to find  out

who  is  responsible for this trouble. I do  not

say  that  all  the students are boycotting  the

examination, because there are some 60 per  cent

of the students who sat for the examinations. It

is also the duty of the Commission of Inquiry to

look  into  the  question whether the  back-seat

drivers of the Barisan Sosialis have anything to

do  with  boycotting  the examinations.  If  the

Member  for  Upper Serangoon, who is at  present

the  Editor-in-chief of the Party organ  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis, feels that his  statement  on

this matter   [Interruption].

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have great difficulty in

following these interjections. If the Member for

Upper  Serangoon wishes to interject, I am  sure

if he gets up the Prime Minister will give way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come on, come on!

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Just now I was only helping

the Prime Minister to choose the correct word.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Then I must

thank  him, because very often he used to  help

me in this. Without his help, I do not think  I

would be able to speak Mandarin this well. So I

must  admit that it was only with his help that

I   have  learnt  Mandarin  and  made  progress

thereon. But unfortunately I am unable to  help

him  in his political thinking. He is still  at

the  stage of young students who are liable  to

make  many  mistakes. Because of  the  language

difficulty, I could not explain to him  why  it

would  be  bad  for  him  to  go  over  to  the

Opposition. It is a pity that I cannot  do  so.

Partly  I  should be responsible for his  going

over,  because I cannot help him  when  he  had

helped me to learn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now he said that he had published the

students' statement because of freedom  of  the

Press  and  freedom of news. He has  had  close

association  with  me, and therefore,  when  we

parted,  I  did  not say very  much  about  him

because of our personal relationship. All of  a

sudden,  good  friends have become  enemies.  I

think it is a bad thing to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

Delightful though the Prime Minister  is  as  a

speaker,  we  have  a merger motion.  Could  we

dispose  of  this  one and go straight  to  the

point?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You started it!

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I did not start it.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister is

indulging in his skilful way of wandering  away

and coming back to the point. At the moment,  I

cannot say that he is very much irrelevant. Mr

Prime Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you,

Mr  Speaker. He has had close association with

me. When he was Editor of the P.A.P. organ,  he

was in full support of the trade union movement

as  the  P.A.P. was. I introduced him to  trade

union  leaders who gave him, news  about  their

own unions. So

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point

of clarification.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Prime Minister said that news came  to

me  only  as  a result of his introducing  trade

union  leaders to me. But he has forgotten  that

before I joined the P.A.P. I was a reporter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member

for  Cairnhill knows that the Member  for  Upper

Serangoon  was a reporter of Sin Pao, which  was

closed down, and then after that the P.A.P. gave

him  some  work  to  do. The  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon says today that when he published  the

statement of the students, it does not mean that

the Barisan Sosialis was in support of them. Now

we want to talk about how to handle this matter.

We  will  tell them that they are handling  this

matter  wrongly, because the students will  look

at the paper and say, "Chan Sun Wing has sold us

out."  This is the first mistake they have made.

The  second mistake is whether they are sincere.

The  ex-Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  Education  asked,  "How  is  it  that  they

publish the views of only one side and not  both

sides? If there is freedom of speech and freedom

of  the Press then they should publish the views

of both sides."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have asked about our broadcasting station.

We  are  waiting for them to come to our  forum.

That  night, when I was engaged in a  debate  in

this  House, I said that in a forum  over  Radio

Singapore they were defeated by the Minister for

Finance, and so they did not dare to come for  a

second  round in a public forum. At  that  time,

because of his temper, he said, "At any time and

anywhere."  Well, at any time and anywhere.  The

Minister  for Education said that  it  would  be

better  to  invite the Chairman of  the  Barisan

Sosialis to take part in the next public forum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I thought I had explained

to  the  House  that  day why  it  was  that  I

refused. The debate was coming on Monday.  They

wanted to have the forum on Sunday. What is the

meaning of that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now I know

it  is  better for him to have another  excuse,

because  after  this debate he  will  be  given

another  invitation  to  a  forum  at  a  radio

station   anywhere.  It   is   no   use   using

threatening  methods. Or we  can  have  a  mass

rally. All right, let it be.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I now ask the Prime

Minister  to  come  back to the  theme  of  this

adjournment  motion, which is  this  boycott  by

students? There is no right of reply. I  thought

that is quite clear. In this debate the Minister

for  Education has no right to reply. The  reply

now,  I  take  it, is being made  by  the  Prime

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   must  give  a  chance  to   the   ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Education because if he does not say it today he

may  not have a chance tomorrow, or he may  have

consulted his back-seat driver. So it  would  be

better  if he could stand up right now  and  say

whether what I have said is right or wrong. What

is  his attitude and stand on the 4:2 system and

the  3:3  system and what is his  stand  on  the

boycott of the examination?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> It is more my asking you

for  advice whether it is a point of order.  The

Member  for  Serangoon  Gardens  would  like  to

speak, and would the Prime Minister give way  to

him since he has provoked him into speaking?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. The

Prime  Minister has, in fact, invited the Member

for  Serangoon Gardens to speak. I  take  it  he

will give him an opportunity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Of course, I

will. I think this is some kind of contradiction-an internal contradiction among themselves. The

views  openly  expressed by their  leaders  have

originally been decided by the backseat drivers.

Their 'articles have been written by their back-seat  drivers. They have now come here  to  play

some spook show. Today it is a free debate. They

can   freely  express  their  stand  and   their

attitude, if they have any stand or attitude  at

all.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There are only five minutes left.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Two minutes

will  be enough for me. There are two questions.

What is their stand on the boycott of the common

examination,  and  whether  they   support   the

students' boycott? The second question is,  what

:, their stand on the changing of the 3:3 system

to  the 4:2 system? Of course, this question can

be   put   to  the  Commission  of  Inquiry   to

investigate.  I feel that the Member  for  Anson

has  great experience in regard to the  exercise

of  democratic rights. I think the investigation

by  the  Commission of Inquiry will give the  13

Assemblymen a chance to come forward  and  state

their  attitude, and disclose how they made  use

of  the  students to further their own  ends  to

destroy our merger.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I want to make it quite

clear  that  in this particular case the  debate

will end at 8.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> One minute democracy!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, according to our Standing Orders, we do not

provide that the motion cannot be debated  until

we reach 3.00 a.m. or 4.00 a.m., because we have

the  right to set aside the Standing Orders. But

I  feel  that  they are rather excited.  Perhaps

they  have something to tell me. That is  why  I

want  to  give  them a chance to speak  on  this

matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not expect

the Prime Minister to give me only two minutes

to  speak. I will reply to certain allegations

made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Education talked about what I  had

asked  him  a  few days ago in the C.P.A.  Room

about the matters raised today. I have received

five  letters from the students, who have  also

sent  this letter to every Assemblyman. I think

every Assemblyman and every political Party has

received  this letter. I will ask  him  how  he

deals  with  this matter. But I did not  expect

that  he  would keep this matter in  his  heart

without disclosing his intention as to what  he

wanted to do with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. I have left the

Government  for  about four  months.  For  two

years,  when I was with the Government,  there

had  never been any incident. But today,  when

anything happens, the Government pushes  every

responsibility and blame on my shoulder.  This

is  not reasonable. Perhaps in case there  may

be  further occurrences or incidents, then the

Government  will  push  everything  on  to  my

shoulders. It is not reasonable on the part of

the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that we must remember that

when  this incident occurred recently  at  the

Parliamentary  Secretaries' meeting,  we  know

that  the  opinion expressed at  this  meeting

would not be -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The present motion for

adjournment  lapses. May I ask the  Leader  to

move a new motion for adjournment?
