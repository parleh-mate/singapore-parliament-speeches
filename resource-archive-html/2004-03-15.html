FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Sir, last Saturday, before Parliament adjourned, I announced, in response to Dr Teo Ho Pin, the plans for the downtown at Marina Bay including the development of the waterfront promenade, a new bridge and also other amenities, so that we could open up the area and make it much more vibrant, accessible and attractive.&nbsp; I also announced that the Government would appoint URA as the development agent to proactively develop the area.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would now like to assure Dr Teo that the release of any land at the downtown at Marina Bay, such as the VSC land, will factor in the supply of space in the existing city.&nbsp; The existing CBD which encompasses Shenton Way, Raffles Place and even the Marina Centre area, will not be neglected.&nbsp; The existing CBD will combine with the new extension at Marina Bay to form a core business district for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owners of older commercial buildings in the existing central business district are refurbishing and modernising their premises in order to stay competitive and to attract tenants.&nbsp; There were quite a few examples recently&nbsp; -&nbsp; the Singapore Land Tower at Raffles Place, IBM Tower at Anson Road and the former Chartered Bank building at Battery Road.&nbsp; There are also opportunities to redevelop some buildings for complementary uses, like housing, and this will further enliven the city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, all the above will help to rejuvenate the existing CBD and enable it to remain competitive and relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1712<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the longer-term, the successful development of the downtown at Marina Bay will bring in jobs, enhance real estate values and create a vibrant and exciting waterfront area for Singaporeans and for visitors.&nbsp; Together with other exciting developments that were announced recently, like the proposed leisure resort complex in the Southern Islands, it will reinforce Singapore&rsquo;s position and competitiveness as a regional and international business and financial hub as well as a tourist destination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to assure Members that other key areas in the city will not be neglected.&nbsp; Orchard Road is one such area.&nbsp; Orchard Road is an icon.&nbsp; It is a shopping street, well known overseas.&nbsp; It is synonymous with great shopping, good food, good hotels.&nbsp; But we need to safeguard Orchard Road&rsquo;s position as one of Asia&rsquo;s premier destinations because of increasing competition from other shopping destinations in the region.&nbsp; So, we have to find new ways to remake Orchard Road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that the private sector has responded to the challenge.&nbsp; For example, there are some new developments, such as Wisma Atria and Paragon, which have recently repositioned themselves and revamped their developments in response to the market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is also working to improve the experience for shoppers along Orchard Road, and one of the areas for improvement, which many have been fed back, is pedestrian connectivity.&nbsp; What URA is planning to do is to build up a comprehensive underground pedestrian network in Orchard Road and in the CBD.&nbsp; To encourage developers to build these underground links, I am pleased to announce that the Government will adopt&nbsp; a co-funding approach and provide a cash grant to developers who wish to implement selected key linkages between developments along Orchard Road as well as in the central business district.&nbsp; A sum <p align=left>Column: 1713<p>of $59 million has already been approved for this purpose, and URA will be announcing the details of this scheme very shortly.&nbsp; I would also like to add that URA is now working closely with the Singapore Tourism Board to develop other plans and ideas to enhance Orchard Road and to make it even more exciting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now address Dr Teo Ho Pin&rsquo;s question about underpasses, particularly, he asked whether we can provide more flexibility to developers to build underpasses.&nbsp; Sir, underpass construction is very much a part of land sales requirements for the city centre sites, again, to provide for better pedestrian connectivity, particularly in those high-density sites around MRT stations or in high traffic areas.&nbsp; These underpasses, we all recognise, serve a very useful purpose, especially when the weather is not so convenient for walking.&nbsp; In many areas in the city area, we cannot build overpasses or overhead connectors because of physical site constraints or sometimes because of aesthetics.&nbsp; Hence, the specification for underpasses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1995, there have been some 12 sites which have included underpass requirements under the sale of sites conditions.&nbsp; So, these underpasses, for example, Raffles Link which links the Esplanade theatres, the Marina Centre shopping areas with the City Hall MRT station are very well utilised.&nbsp; In other locations, developers can choose whether they want to build underpasses or overhead bridges.&nbsp; One such example is the Tekka corner site where they can choose whether to build one or the other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must say that developers generally see the benefits of these direct underground pedestrian connections, especially to the nearby MRT stations. The requirement for underpasses is stated upfront so that developers can factor in the construction cost at an early stage.&nbsp; I do not think that the requirements are that onerous <p align=left>Column: 1714<p>because of the benefits that are offered by better connectivity.&nbsp; So I would like to assure Dr Teo that we will continue to discuss with the developers and to make sure that these requirements are reasonable and, more importantly, are made known to them upfront.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I now ask my Senior Parliamentary Secretary to respond to the other queries?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Sir, on Saturday, speaking on his cut on capital grants to the HDB, Mr Steve Chia noted that HDB had lost $773 million in the year 2003, $997 million in the year 2002 and $952 million in the year 2001, and had received an accumulated Government grant of $11.5 billion since 1960.&nbsp; Yet, HDB had equity of $4.9 billion and a capital gains reserve of $8.2 billion in the asset revaluation reserve.&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia wanted to know how HDB, despite its deficits, could accumulate such a large reserve.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in response, I explained in the House that these reserves refer to assets acquired under past terms of office of the Government, and that under the Constitution, these reserves cannot be drawn upon without the approval of the President. With your approval, Sir, please let me elaborate on this matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB is a key statutory board listed in the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1991.&nbsp; Hence, HDB is required to safeguard its assets as at the change over date of Government.&nbsp; These assets mainly refer to its commercial and industrial properties and car parks which are owned and managed by HDB.&nbsp; Sir, if HDB disposes of any of these assets, eg, when HDB sells a shop under the Sale-of-Shops Scheme, any capital gains or losses so arising must be transferred to the reserves <p align=left>Column: 1715<p>account, namely, the capital gains reserve, for safeguarding.&nbsp; This is what the $4.9 billion in the capital gains reserve refers to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the assets revaluation reserve of $8.2 billion, this is an account which dates back all the way to 1985 when HDB adopted its present conventional accounting system to better account for its activities.&nbsp; All properties owned by HDB were valued in 1985 and 1986.&nbsp; The difference between this value and historical cost of the properties was recorded as the asset revaluation reserve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the deficit in HDB&rsquo;s financial statements reflects the results of HDB&rsquo;s operations.&nbsp; As I have told the House on Saturday, HDB&rsquo;s projected deficit of $422 million for FY 2004 is mainly due to the sale of subsidised flats and the provision of CPF housing grants to eligible flat buyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The past capital reserves which appear in HDB&rsquo;s accounts are a different matter altogether, and as they are safeguarded under the Constitution, cannot be used to finance HDB&rsquo;s deficits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would now like to answer Mr Steve Chia&rsquo;s question on the safety of shopping centres and Mr Ang Mong Seng&rsquo;s questions on car parks.&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia asked about the rules for converting car parks and public spaces and expressed concern over their impact on fire safety.&nbsp; Conversion of car parks and public space into shop floors requires planning permission.&nbsp; Approval is granted only if the developer can comply with all the technical requirements of all the Government agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Civil Defence Force, in particular, would allow the conversion only if fire safety requirements are fulfilled.&nbsp; For example, they must be <p align=left>Column: 1716<p>assured that the existing staircases and exits are able to accommodate the increased number of occupants and the necessary fire protection systems are provided.&nbsp; They will also ensure that the fire hose access points are not blocked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for temporary structures which do not require planning permission, such as tents for short duration events like trade fairs, festive bazaars and carnivals, the owners are still required to obtain licences or permits from relevant authorities including the SCDF.&nbsp; Proposal layout with the access would ensure that they do not pose fire hazards.&nbsp; Fire safety is a primary concern of all the agencies.&nbsp; Measures and means of escape must also be adequately provided at the site.&nbsp; The above controls should allay the fears over the fire safety of converted space and ad hoc structures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng has suggested to merge HDB and URA car parks sections for operational efficiency and greater convenience to the public.&nbsp; URA and HDB car parks are located in different areas and serve different purposes.&nbsp; HDB car parks are mainly in HDB residential estates serving mainly residents. URA car parks, on the other hand, serve mainly commercial and recreational areas outside the HDB estates, mainly in the business area. URA car parks are primarily for short-term parking, whereas HDB car parks, on the other hand, are mostly for season parking.&nbsp; Given the different locations, purposes and management of car park functions of HDB and URA, it is useful to keep the two functions separate.&nbsp; Where it is practical to do so, both HDB and URA have adopted similar practices by using the same coupons.&nbsp; So his analogy that HDB and URA operate under MND is like &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; is not quite correct.&nbsp; Because in one country, two systems, they carry two passports.&nbsp; In this system, we carry one same coupon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng also suggested that HDB and URA car parks should <p align=left>Column: 1717<p>switch over from the manual coupon system to the electronic parking system.&nbsp; This system has been implemented in some car parks.&nbsp; We will look into the possibility of putting the system in place in more car parks.<br></p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</B> Sir, can I just seek one clarification from the Minister?&nbsp;</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; All right.</P></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B> I think the Minister has not answered the question on the underpass security threat.

This phenomenon was experienced by the United Kingdom in the 1980s where there were lots of refurbishment work in London, due to changing market conditions. One key lesson which we can learn from the UK experience is the use of fast track construction technique to meet the changing needs of building users. Many refurbishment contracts in London were complex and had a short con<p align=left>Column: 1718<p>struction period. As such, contractors adopted a wide variety of construction techniques such as prefabrication, fitting out or dry construction methods, to meet the tight construction schedules.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether the Ministry has any plans to introduce fast track construction in Singapore.</P></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</B> Sir, the construction industry has been contracting since the Asian financial crisis. In fact, conventional wisdom is that more contractors will go belly up in the coming months.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our construction industry has contributed much to Singapore&rsquo;s physical development and would continue to play a role in the economy, albeit a smaller one. We must not forget our experience with the shipping industry which, up to just a few years ago, was considered a sunset industry destined to oblivion. Now on the back of enhanced international trade flows, it is a thriving industry again and one of the few industries able to offer jobs to our unemployed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the Government should not interfere in the market to help poorly managed, unproductive firms, we must take care not to implement rules and practices which add to the woes of our long suffering contractors. Last year, I had mentioned in my cut on the construction industry that many contractors feel that though Government regulations are well intentioned, it is as if they are being pushed to "<i>pai tui tiou lou</i>" &ndash; Hokkein for "Queue up to commit suicide".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, I think the many high profile incidents of stalled work as a result of contractors going bust that took place subsequently proved this point &ndash; that many contractors had indeed submitted low suicidal bids due not only to the poor economy, but, according to many <p align=left>Column: 1719<p>contractors, the competition for jobs at all costs in order to meet the requirements to remain on the BCA registration system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides modifying the requirements of the registration system to mitigate this problem, I would like to highlight another area that the BCA could look into. BCA should encourage Government departments to allow contractors with expertise and registration in different types of works &ndash; civil or engineering &ndash; to form joint ventures to tender for projects requiring different expertise. There should be no necessity for Government departments to require at least one of the contractors in a joint venture to have expertise in all types of work required as this would effectively bar many smaller and medium sized contractors.&nbsp; A case in point is the ferry terminal project at Marine Coastal Drive. I understand that for this project, even if there is a joint venture, at least one of the partners in the joint venture must have registration for both civil and building works in order to be eligible for the tender of this project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to urge the Minister to look into these issues and concerns.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Sir, under MND's guidance, the Building and Construction Authority aims to develop a technologically advanced construction industry which serves Singapore's economic needs and ensures that buildings and infrastructure are of high safety standards. One of the key thrusts is to develop a technologically advanced and competitive construction industry, able to deliver high quality building infrastructure. I have a few questions for the Minister.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's construction industry has been shrinking. What is the Government doing to expand the construction industry? The recent announcement in the Budget of the increase in the skilled labour <p align=left>Column: 1720<p>levy of $30 to $50 has really added to the costs to the contractors who are facing this shrinking construction industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry was also forced to review the tender system as well as the payment guidelines to the contractors when a few major construction companies went under water. Can the Ministry give an update on the measures introduced so far or planned to introduce? Has the Ministry also looked into the payment of the sub-contractors in the process of this review? And, if so, can the Ministry give an update of the progress of the review? This is important as in the event of default by a main contractor, there will be a domino effect on all the sub-contractors. Will the Government also look into a system where the contractors can have some protection against cost escalation?&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been drastic increases in the prices of raw materials due to the oil crisis as well as the demand for the raw materials of the growing Asian countries.&nbsp; For example, the cost of reinforcement bars has increased from $570 per ton in October 2003 to about $1,000 per ton in February 2004, that is, within a period of five months - a 100% increase in prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Government intervene, just as it did for the banks, and get the construction industry to merge and consolidate so that they can face the challenges posed by the big companies from China, Korea and Japan? The recent award of large developments, for example, T3, Republic Polytechnic and mega ITE, to foreign construction companies,&nbsp;does not encourage the growth of the local construction industry.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</B> Sir, the shakeout of the local construction industry since 2001 has devastated many construction companies and their sub-contractors. During my meet-the-people sessions over this period, several sub-contractors came to me, laying bare their problems under the existing contractors' <p align=left>Column: 1721<p>sub-contractor framework, which is viewed to be heavily loaded against them. One, in particular, complained about the novated sub-contractor system. In his case, he won a contract, an open tender, but was forced by the developer to work under a main contractor with whom he had no previous working relationship. In the course of the construction, there was a dispute and the main contractor refused to pay. Not only that, the main contractor forfeited his deposit; the bank pulled out his loan, and he was bankrupted. &nbsp;Soon his home will be repossessed. &nbsp;Sir, it was indeed heart-wrenching to see a grown man cry.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, Sir, we have other unhealthy practices between main contractors and sub-contractors. These have been highlighted in the newspapers.&nbsp; I just like to point out one, and that is, the sale of headcounts of foreign construction workers.&nbsp; MOM controls the number of foreign workers in the industry by tying the issuance of work permits to the award of major contracts. Thus, when a main contractor gets the job, he could parcel out the foreign workers' work permits to the sub-contractors, often times, at a price. At a good time, the rate could go as high as $1,500 per worker. The sub-contractors have to submit to this because it is their livelihood.&nbsp; The main contractor would also squeeze the workers themselves for a significant sum through their recruitment agents. Thus, the main contractor would make money personally while their construction company could go bust.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we have this unusual phenomenon of contractors bidding below cost, leading the company to go bust later, but the owner of this company continues to have lots of cash in his pocket.&nbsp; This is unhealthy and should be eradicated.&nbsp; In our attempt to regulate the industry, we have instead created a maze where if you could navigate it, there is still much profit to be made. The situation reminds me of a<p align=left>Column: 1722<p> Chinese saying, "<i>shang you zheng zhe, xia you dui zhe</i>", which means for every policy, there is a counter-measure. Sir, I thought this only happens in China, but it is Singapore here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also echo Mdm Cynthia Phua's call regarding the rapid run-up of raw material prices, especially steel. They have delivered another unexpected blow to the sub-contractors. It is indeed the proverbial last straw on the camel's back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Minister to take the current downturn in the construction industry to carry out a thorough multi-ministerial review of the myriad rules and regulations governing the construction industry. Hopefully, we could lay the foundation of a robust and healthy construction industry, which is indeed crucial to the continued success of Singapore.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<P><I>Construction Workforce</I></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the construction industry is often regarded as a dirty, dangerous and demanding industry. But it is also an industry which produces tough and resilient workers. Construction workers are known to be able to work under tough conditions and possess multiple skills. Due to the ease in employing foreign workers in Singapore, the Singapore's construction industry has failed to develop a local construction workforce over these years. The lack of recognition and poor image have also impeded the recruitment of Singaporeans into the industry.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the bulk of workers at the construction sites are foreigners, and construction is still highly labour intensive. Sir, there are two compelling reasons why we need to reconsider developing a local construction workforce. First, it is not sustainable to rely solely on foreign workers for construction work, and, second, we must develop our own local construction workforce which can also be<p align=left>Column: 1723<p> our own emergency workforce in times of disasters.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an urgent need to review the operations of the Construction Industry Training Institute. We must provide more opportunities for Singaporeans to learn multiple construction skills and earn a good salary as a skilled tradesman. Without strong recognition from the Government, it will be an uphill task to attract younger Singaporeans to join the construction industry.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Are there plans by BCA to develop a local construction workforce?</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; How many locals and foreigners were trained by CITI yearly?</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Can we train our construction workforce to be an emergency workforce for disaster management?</P></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:&nbsp;</B> Go on to your next cut, please, Dr Teo.</P></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contractors Registry System</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the revised Contractors Registry System has resulted in an unhealthy state of construction firms in Singapore. Its requirements for turnover and the need to have a mixture of public and private projects track record for renewal and upgrading have pushed many construction firms to commit "suicidal" bids. This has resulted in a large number of construction firms (some formerly G8 contractors) going bankrupt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent liquidation of some MUP main contractors has caused much disruption to many residents. As for those contractors who are more conservative, they were downgraded to a much lower <p align=left>Column: 1724<p>grading, such as C1 and C2, for failing to achieve the required turnover. This situation is unhealthy as we are penalising our established contractors. The downgrading also retards their company's growth as they cannot participate in certain Government tenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand the intention of the revised registry system is to consolidate the industry. But the desired outcome may be a setback for the industry as more "cowboys" are graded to be A1 and A2 contractors due to their total sub-contract practices. This is what the industry calls the "<i>Ali Baba"</i> package. While credible and established construction firms are downgraded and cannot sustain their businesses, we need to review the contractors' registry system to ensure that the criteria will help to develop world-class construction firms in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Minister how many G8 contractors were downgraded as a result of the new registry system? Will the Ministry consider reviewing the registration and upgrading criteria? And in what ways has the registration improved the quality and professionalism of contractors?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Construction Projects</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B>&nbsp;<I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, at the moment, most building projects are awarded to the contractors on a tender system.&nbsp; Normally, the contractor who submitted the lowest bid will be the successful bidder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they have been awarded the contract, they will sub-contract parts of the project to the sub-contractors.&nbsp; Many of these main contractors, upon receipt of the initial payment from the developers, would transfer the fund to other projects or other investments. As a result, they are unable to pay the sub-contractors for the work they have done.&nbsp; But the sub-contractors will still have to carry on the job and complete their project, failing<p align=left>Column: 1725<p> which they will be sued by the main contractor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort of system is advantageous to the main contractor, but biased against the sub-contractors.&nbsp; In other countries, the funds received by the main contractor could only be used for the same project and not to be transferred to other projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to suggest that some regulations be made requiring the main contractor to set up a&nbsp;special "Project Account" for every project.&nbsp; Any payment received for the project shall be deposited in this project&nbsp;account and be used only for the specific project. The main contractor would not be allowed to transfer the fund elsewhere. In this way, there is no excuse for the main contractor not to pay his sub-contactors for their dues in the project concerned. The sub-contractors will not be inconvenienced due to lack of funds to carry on with the project.&nbsp; As such, all projects should complete in time and the image of our building industry will not be tarnished.&nbsp; I&nbsp; hope that the Minister would look into the regulation for a special project account to be set up for each construction project.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P><P></P><P>&nbsp;</P></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Many industry practitioners in the construction industry are still not familiar with this approach.&nbsp; As the Ministry has recently amended the Building Control Act to promote a performance based system, we should incorporate total building performance when designing and retrofitting buildings.&nbsp;

Sir, on my next cut,&nbsp;the performance of a building is dependent on five key factors, namely: design, construction, maintenance, usage and environmental factors.&nbsp; Many designs and materials used in temperate climate are not suitable for our tropical climate conditions.&nbsp; That is why we often see building defects in many of our buildings, such as cracks, delamination, algae growth, water seepage, water splashing and corrosion.&nbsp; These failures are due to a lack of research and knowledge on the performance of buildings in tropical climate conditions.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, not much emphasis has been placed on research and development in the construction industry.&nbsp; Many building researchers are academics from the universities who work part-time on research projects.&nbsp; Both the BCA and local construction firms are also not proactive in spearheading research.&nbsp; They also do not receive much support from the Government or developers.&nbsp; In contrast, Japanese contractors invest a considerable amount on research and development to develop new technologies and systems.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If we can facilitate their mobility, the social divide for people with disabilities will shrink.&nbsp; MRT stations, HDB flats, commercial buildings have improved tremendously over the years to provide more handicapped-friendly facilities.&nbsp; What&nbsp;is lacking are appropriate connecting facilities between buildings for better access for persons with disabilities.&nbsp; Just to illustrate, most of the sheltered walkways today offer little protection to wheelchair bound pedestrians on rainy days.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also improve access to public transport for people with disabilities. &nbsp; It is almost impossible for wheelchair bound persons to take a bus, the footpath from&nbsp;a block of flats to the bus stop and steps leading to a bus stop are really challenging deterrents, let alone getting up the bus.&nbsp; The current design of overhead bridges&nbsp;is definitely not a solution for the handicapped to use to cross the roads.&nbsp; In fact, the overhead pedestrian bridge over <st1:Street><st1:address>Old Airport Road</st1:address></st1:Street> and Mountbatten Road is not popular with the residents at all.&nbsp; And it breaks the link of footpaths within the HDB blocks.&nbsp; They rely mainly on taxis and rely very much on the charity of the taxi drivers to bring them round.&nbsp; We should progressively improve the environment and encourage physically challenged persons to be more mobile.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designing footpaths and linkways that are handicapped-friendly will also mean that senior citizens are likely to enjoy the ease of use and being friendly and safe,<p align=left>Column: 1730<p> children will also benefit from such designs.&nbsp; I propose that MND initiate a plan to incorporate handicapped-friendly footpaths for travel to important locations within the HDB precincts where the handicapped can have easy access to critical services and public transport.&nbsp; This can serve as an example for private developers to follow suit as well.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB can work with the handicapped interest groups and the community to identify the needs and solutions and require developers to provide safe and convenient access, shelters from elements and safety features.&nbsp; We have to stay away from the misconception that handicapped-friendly facilities are no more than just having ramps and&nbsp;parking lots for the handicapped.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, first of all, I would like to address the questions related to the contractors' procurement system, and then I will ask my SPS to address the other questions.&nbsp; Sir, we all know that the contractors have been having a hard time recently.&nbsp; Last few years have been particularly difficult ones mainly because the construction demand has shrunk by more than 50%.&nbsp; In 2003, last year, construction demand was $10 billion, the lowest in more than a decade.&nbsp; And if you compare that with, say, during the boom years, at its peak, construction demand was more than $20 billion.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, the total number of contractors, the size of the construction industry, the manpower involved, the firms involved, have more or less remained the same.&nbsp; In other words, there are simply not enough jobs to go around and I think that is really the fundamental cause of many of the problems facing contractors, subcontractors and many of the ills which are confronting the industry today.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because competition for jobs has become more intense, many firms have faced severe financial difficulties.&nbsp; And I<p align=left>Column: 1731<p> think the experience which Dr Wang recounted just now, I am sure has been faced by many other Members of Parliament as well.&nbsp; We do sympathise with their plight and to the extent that we can help, I think the Government will.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Mdm Cynthia Phua have asked what we can&nbsp;do about the situation.&nbsp; I think one of the common complaints is about subcontractors not being paid, or not being paid on time.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; Members will recall, last year, I introduced a package of help measures for the construction industry in Parliament.&nbsp; This was some time in October last year.&nbsp; At the same time, I also mentioned that BCA was looking into the possibility of introducing a security of payment legislation, or SOP legislation.&nbsp; Under this legislation, we would provide statutory rights to contractors to seek payment for works done.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to inform Members that BCA has completed the study of the SOP legislation that are existing in other countries - Australia, UK, New Zealand - and we will be introducing a SOP legislation that will be suitable for local conditions.&nbsp; The key elements in this legislation will be (1) the right to progress payment for works done; (2) the right to suspend work if not paid; and (3) a fast and low cost adjudication system to resolve progress payment disputes.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">11.45 am</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The industry has suggested that work suspension should be allowed only after adjudication, and only if the adjudicated amount has not been paid.&nbsp; The industry has also asked that developers be allowed to make direct payment to the subcontractors in cases of non-payment by the main contractor, in other words, bypassing the main contractor in order to make sure that cash flows to the people who are doing work and to make sure that the project does not get delayed or aborted.&nbsp; BCA will consider these suggestions in developing the proposed legislation.&nbsp; I must hasten to add that such legislation is not a panacea for the payment woes that are faced by contractors and subcontractors, but it will at least facilitate the cash flow and alleviate the problem of non-payment along the value chain, as highlighted by Dr Wang Kai Yuen and other Members.&nbsp; I expect to table this legislation in Parliament in the latter half of this year, and further details will be announced then.<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng also touched on the issue of escrow accounts, ie, project accounts.&nbsp; This was actually studied by the group looking into the industry.&nbsp; Although it has some merits, unfortunately, there are many other problems associated with it.&nbsp; It is a complicated issue to manage and would require legislative backup.&nbsp; But I think, more importantly, even with such an account, there will still be payment disputes between contractors and subcontractors, and also between contractors and developers.&nbsp; So, we have decided that, for the moment, we will not be pursuing such an account.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn now to Dr Teo Ho Pin's questions on the Contractors Registry System (CRS).&nbsp; He expressed concerns about the registration renewal criteria, and asked what are the effects of this scheme on the quality and professionalism of local<p align=left>Column: 1733<p> contractors.&nbsp; The CRS, if I may go a little&nbsp;bit into the background, was set up as a centralised registry to prequalify contractors for public sector jobs.&nbsp; It grades and then prequalifies these firms, depending on their scale and skills, and the criteria include factors like financial strength, track record, manpower capabilities.&nbsp; This is necessary because projects are getting much more complicated.&nbsp; They are much more complex, and they require a multitude of skills, robust financial strength and manpower expertise.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked why do we require multi-skills for certain jobs.&nbsp; The complexity of such jobs require such multi-skills within the contractors involved.&nbsp; So, if you have a firm that is registered at a lower grade, you will face difficulties in trying to undertake larger scale projects, especially those that span a long time.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo wanted to know specifically how many G8 contractors were downgraded with the implementation of the new registry system.&nbsp; The BCA revamped the registration criteria in July 2002, ie, almost two years ago, and that was to better match the higher standards required in construction projects.&nbsp; For building works, the number of firms in the previous G8 grade was 87.&nbsp; In the new equivalent grade, which is A1 grade, this has come down to 38.&nbsp; So, basically, it has been reduced from 87 to 38, or more than half.&nbsp; For civil engineering works, the number was reduced from 52 to 23, again more than half.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo also suggested that the CRS grade renewal criteria be reviewed.&nbsp; Again, I would like to inform him that this was done.&nbsp; BCA relaxed the requirements, particularly for track record for CRS grade renewal in October last year.&nbsp; This was at the same time as I announced the package of help measures.&nbsp; The qualifying period for grading has been extended from three years to five years.&nbsp; And BCA also allowed on-going projects to be taken into account.&nbsp; So, as a result of this, firms will<p align=left>Column: 1734<p> not be under great pressure to tender for projects at unrealistically low bids, or so-called suicide or <i>tiou lou</i> bids, as Dr Amy Khor calls them, in order to satisfy this required track record.&nbsp; At the same time, he will recall that we tightened the timeframe to submit financial accounts for A1, A2 and then, later on, for B1 firms, in order to provide more time checks on the financial status of the firms undertaking public sector projects.&nbsp; So, all these changes were made with a view to improving the health of the construction industry as well as to help some of the contractors satisfy the CRS requirements.&nbsp; But I would agree that we need to continuously review the CRS requirements regularly, and I assure him that we will do so in consultation with the industry, other Government agencies and also the GPC for National Development.&nbsp; We should also be mindful that we do not make changes too frequently, otherwise it is going to confuse the firms seeking registration, renewal or upgrading.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo also asked whether the CRS has improved the quality of the local contractors.&nbsp; If you look at the statistics last year, more than 95% of the public sector construction projects - I only refer to public sector construction projects because the private sector does not provide such data to us - were graded satisfactory and above, and in meeting the CRS requirements, you will see that many of our larger local contractors now have more professionals in key positions, and that the management practices are now fully compliant with many of the ISO standards.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether we can protect the contractors against cost escalations, particularly the rapid increase in cost of, say, steel as a result of high demand from China.&nbsp; I think some of these cost increases, eg, the increase in the cost of steel, are really factors which are beyond the Government's control.&nbsp; And construction material prices are dynamic.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1735<p>They are affected by worldwide supply and demand, and the reason international steel price hikes, for example, has caused some contractors to bear unexpected additional pain.&nbsp; However, on the flip side, if prices had dropped, the contractors would, of course, pocket the savings.&nbsp; So, for public sector projects, both parties, whether it is the contractor or the agency concerned, will have to accept material price fluctuations as a commercial risk.&nbsp; Public sector agencies are aware of the potential impact of material cost increase on the project, and that is why some of them include a price fluctuation clause in their contracts, especially when such projects span a long period of time, or when the usage of certain materials is high.&nbsp; So, if there is such a clause, then the contractors would be protected.&nbsp; Of course, this clause is made known at the point of tender, so that contractors can price accordingly.&nbsp; But where there is no such provision, the agency is not contractually bound to compensate contractors for any price increases, and contractors will have to bear this cost increase.&nbsp; However, I do know that some agencies are looking into ways to help to ease the cashflow of contractors.&nbsp; In the final analysis, it is up to the agencies as to how they wish to structure their contracts and how they intend to deal with the contractors, bearing in mind of course that they have to safeguard funds.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua expressed some concern about local contractors not being competitive with the big boys, ie, the big foreign firms.&nbsp; I just want to assure her that our local contractors are able to hold their own.&nbsp; I have some figures here which I would like to share with her.&nbsp; In the last two years, local contractors have been awarded something like 15 out of 35 public sector projects valued about&nbsp; $100 million and, of the 20 projects, 11 were awarded to joint ventures between local and foreign contractors.&nbsp; So, I would say<p align=left>Column: 1736<p> that, on the whole, local contractors can compete even for large projects.&nbsp; But having said that, I think there is still merit for local contractors to consolidate to build niche capabilities and to form consortiums or groups in order to look for overseas projects, and the Government will encourage and facilitate such consolidation.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, I think we all realise that it is left to the contractors to decide whether they want to consolidate or not.&nbsp; The Government really cannot intervene or even enforce this.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One final point, to respond to Mdm Cynthia Phua's question about expanding of construction opportunities, first of all, she will recall that the Government has brought forward some public sector projects in order to help the industry, especially the local contractors.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, as I indicated, the size of the local market is small; in fact, it has shrunk considerably, especially under the present economic climate.&nbsp; So, the only way for the contractors to grow is to venture abroad, and there are opportunities overseas.&nbsp; The market in India and China is growing at an average rate of about 10% annually, and there is a tremendous window of opportunity for local contractors.&nbsp; BCA, together with IE Singapore, has intensified efforts to promote export of construction services in the last few years.&nbsp; They have organised trade missions to help Singapore firms to gain a foothold in these markets, and they have also facilitated the formation of consortia, ie, joint ventures, among local contractors in order to further expand their markets overseas.&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Minister of State, my Senior Parliamentary Secretary and myself have all been involved in these promotion efforts and will continue to do so in order to help the local industry.&nbsp; Overseas orders for 2003, just to put this on record, reached about $1 billion, and I expect that we can grow this number even further, if<p align=left>Column: 1737<p> local contractors can work together and, with Government's facilitation, further expand their business overseas.&nbsp; In this way, we can develop an external wing, capitalise on the Singapore brand name, and we can offer value-added services to establish a significant presence overseas for our construction industry.</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Dr Teo suggested amending current building legislation or introducing new legislation to achieve total building performance.&nbsp; Total building performance is still an evolving science without international benchmarks or standards.&nbsp; Initiatives for Total Building Performance should be industry-driven, with the aim to provide better buildings and better quality buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA's approach therefore is to specify and legislate only minimum performance requirements to ensure safe buildings that are fit for occupancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the question on sustainable development, BCA is actively promoting it in construction projects.&nbsp; From July this year, contractors in the A1 and A2 categories of the Contractors Registry Scheme will be required to obtain ISO 14000 Certification on Environmental Management.&nbsp; This aims to minimise environmental impact of&nbsp;their construction activities. BCA and&nbsp;NEA are also&nbsp;exploring the feasibility of introducing environmental impact assessment for existing<p align=left>Column: 1738<p> and new buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;the building research institute, Dr Teo asked if&nbsp;Singapore could become a research centre for tropical climate building construction.&nbsp;Sir, the answer must be yes.&nbsp; In November 2000,&nbsp;BCA and&nbsp;NUS jointly established a&nbsp;Centre for Total Building Performance to promote and&nbsp;facilitate R&amp;D&nbsp;collaborations amongst public agencies, tertiary institutions and the private sector so as to make Singapore a hub for tropical building research. The Centre's current R&amp;D activities focuses on environment-related strategies such as sky-rise&nbsp;greening, air quality of indoor&nbsp;environment and energy efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generous funding for programmes, such as the A*STAR's Construction R&amp;D programme and the Innovation Development Scheme has enabled research bodies and private sector companies to attract and recruit a strong group of full-time researchers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the suggestion of developing Singapore into a regional testing centre for building materials and products, I wish to point out that the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) of SPRING Singapore was established for this purpose.&nbsp; Since 1986, the SAC has accredited many local laboratories that may test and certify building materials and products under&nbsp;the Singapore Laboratory Accreditation Scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on fast-track construction, Dr Teo also spoke of the need to develop our contractors' capabilities for fast-track construction.&nbsp; The BCA has introduced a buildable design legislation in Janaury 2001.&nbsp; The legislation requires buildings to be designed to allow contractors to adopt labour efficient and fast construction methods. Dry construction using pre-fab components is promoted while conventional wet trades, such as brick walling and plastering are discouraged. The outcome so far has been positive. The use of brick walls in the private residential<p align=left>Column: 1739<p> sector has decreased substantitally. At the same time, the use of pre-cast concrete construction has increased significantly.&nbsp; Pre-fab technology is also promoted through the incentives offered to contractors and prefabricators to mechanise their operations and adopt pre-fab construction methods. Tax allowance is given for a purchase of construction equipment and financial grants for upgrading pre-cast production techniques.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCA also encourages wider use of design-and-build contracts to promote fast-track construction.&nbsp; The amendments to the Building Control Act, the Architects Act and the Professional Engineers Act&nbsp;which took&nbsp;effect from 1st Janaury this year, provided greater flexibility to design-and-build arrangements for improved integration of services, faster construction and cost savings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree with Dr Teo on&nbsp;the need to educate all stakeholders of buildings and facilities to have responsibility for building maintenance. The Minister for National Development has reiterated that the maintenance is a shared responsibility.&nbsp; BCA intends to carry out&nbsp;a comprehensive education programme for stakeholders and building maintenance and management.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, regarding the need to review safety standards for maintenance, BCA recently reviewed the periodic building inspection process.&nbsp; From 1st November 2003, BCA has required professional engineers (PEs) to refer to the structural layout plans when carrying out visual inspections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the questions&nbsp;concerning the construction workforce, the Government has been trying to encourage locals to join the construction workforce, with some success, not total success.&nbsp; But BCA's records show that locals prefer to take up<p align=left>Column: 1740<p> managerial and supervisory positions in the industry and not so much as trademan, ie, labour work.&nbsp; This is a physically demanding nature of contruction work.&nbsp; But we will redouble our efforts and try to recruit more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in a civil emergency, such that when a building collapses, the Singapore Civil Defence Force will be activated as the lead agency for disaster management.&nbsp; Our resident construction workforce has the required skills to help reinstate public amenities and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the cost of construction which was raised by&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay, there is a perception that the cost of construction in Singapore is rather high. About 2-3 years ago, we commissioned a study to verify whether that perception is correct and the result is different from the perception.&nbsp; Our building regulations are not more onerous than those in the UK or the USA.&nbsp; In fact, our construction costs are lower than in Hong Kong and Sydney, though higher than in Kuala Lumpur, we concede.&nbsp; In short, although our construction cost is higher than in Malaysia, we are competitive and is unlikely to be unduly affected by our building codes.&nbsp; In any case, our building codes today are performance-based.&nbsp; In other words, you do not need to design to our codes, you just design to our safety standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On barrier-free accesibility, Mrs Yu-Foo, Ms Braema and Mr Andy Gan raised several concerns.&nbsp; The Code on Barrier-Free Accessibility already includes design guidelines on family-friendly facilities in buildings, like shopping complexes and supermarkets, frequented by families and young children.&nbsp; In addition, National Parks Board has a programme to make parks barrier-free and conducive for the elderly.&nbsp; Ms Braema asked why the Code is not applied to all buildings and developments.&nbsp; There is a good reason for that.&nbsp; First, it will be very costly to the owners of existing buildings to comply with the <p align=left>Column: 1741<p>Code.&nbsp; Existing buildings not designed with such provisions will have to carry major retrofitting works if the Code was applied retrospectively.&nbsp; Moreoever, the Building Control Act does not allow us to apply the Code backwards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the landed residential buildings, ie, the private domain bungalows, semi-detached and terraces, are private properties and only used by the owners exclusively for their guests or friends.&nbsp; The owners should be allowed to decide whether to input the necessary barrier-free features or not.&nbsp; We should not impose such requirements in private domain houses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, plant equipment rooms in buildings are not meant for public access at all. Why would anybody go into an engine room or plant room?&nbsp; So there is no need to provide such features in these rooms.&nbsp; The Code is reviewed regularly every five years and involves all parties which Ms Braema and Mr Andy Gan would like us to include. They include the Handicaps Welfare Association, Singapore Association of Visually Handicapped, Asian Women's Welfare Association and all the Government agencies like MCDS, URA, NEA, HDB, LTA, NCSS and also professional bodies like NUS, SIA, IES, REDAS.&nbsp; Of course, we will welcome any other bodies that need to be included in this committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have answered most of the questions.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Could I remind Members that we are rather behind time on this amendment, so please keep your speech short.&nbsp; Prof.&nbsp;Low, can you take all the three cuts together?</P></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bird Flu</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay</B><B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> The Avian influenza affecting the Asian region is almost over. Looking back, it would be <p align=left>Column: 1742<p>good for us to review what we had intended to do if the H5N1 Avian influenza should strike us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, when the positive type A flu has been detected, all birds will be culled.&nbsp; The announced approach is not to wait for confirmation of the&nbsp;H5N1 infection.&nbsp; Immediately, when type&nbsp;A positive is detected,&nbsp;culling action of all birds will&nbsp;begin.&nbsp;Sir, the positive type A&nbsp;flu does not imply the human type&nbsp;of H5N1 flu infection.&nbsp; It could be other types of flu, such as those well-reported, H7N1 and&nbsp;some other types of&nbsp;flu which&nbsp;are relatively minor. Some of the other types of flu&nbsp;are not infectious&nbsp;to human&nbsp;beings.&nbsp; In agricultural countries like Japan, Canada and America, they cull the birds&nbsp;when H7N1 is detected to prevent the spread of the flu&nbsp;as it will affect other farming&nbsp;activities.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Singapore, we are&nbsp;not an agricultural country.&nbsp; The culling of birds is mainly to prevent the infection to human beings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, the&nbsp;decision to cull&nbsp;all the birds when we detect only the type 'A' positive flu is not &nbsp;well-justified.&nbsp; The action to cull all the birds based on type A positive flu&nbsp;will cost the farmers a great deal of losses.&nbsp; The action to cull all the birds may cost them $20 million.&nbsp; The farmers have sacrificed so much, but we have yet to confirm that the birds have&nbsp;been infected with&nbsp;the human-infected H5N1 flu.&nbsp; Therefore, in my view, we are a little bit over-reacting.&nbsp; The question is that when we make&nbsp;a decision, who pays for the cost?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On culling of the birds, all the chickens will be culled if one farm has detected&nbsp;the positive type 'A' flu.&nbsp; In other words, all the chickens in the farms in Singapore will be culled whether or not that particular farm has detected the positive type A flu.&nbsp; Again, is it necessary to take such a drastic action? The reasons are, firstly,&nbsp;it may not be H5N1 flu which we are concerned with.&nbsp; Secondly, the farms<p align=left>Column: 1743<p> could&nbsp;be so far away, for example, between Sungei Tengah and Lim Chu Kang, may be more than five kilometres away.&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;drawing the&nbsp;infectious circle is quite an arbitrary work and is subject to a lot of arguments.&nbsp; A smaller effective infectious zone to be drawn would avoid many unnecessary losses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third point is that&nbsp;when all the birds in the same farm are culled, why are some other farms being spared?&nbsp; The place that is exempted is the Bird Park. The Minister did explain to the House that the birds in the Bird Park&nbsp;are valuable and their cages are further away and&nbsp;not so congested.&nbsp; If H5N1 should infect the birds near the Bird Park,&nbsp;why should&nbsp;the birds in the Bird Park receive double standards in the treatment by the Government?&nbsp; The birds have to be culled.&nbsp; Therefore, the decision of not culling the birds in the Bird Park, in my view, is technically incorrect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Compensation to Farmers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the chicken farms in Singapore have more than a million birds. If culling action should be taken, the farms will lose more than $20 million, which is the&nbsp;price of the birds.&nbsp; The farms will also suffer a subsequent loss because of the lead time for them to develop until they are in full productive mode again.&nbsp; The&nbsp;total losses could be more than double.&nbsp; I estimate it could be about $50 million. The Government did mention in this House that compensation would be made, but&nbsp;did not say&nbsp;how much compensation would be offered.&nbsp; Judging from the case of Pulau Ubin, there are only a few hundred birds in the termination list, and the cost of which will only be about $5,000.&nbsp; The Government did not pay the $5,000 to the small-time farmers but instead the Poultry Import and Export Association, where I serve as&nbsp;its Advisor -&nbsp;I have to declare my interest that this Association has nothing to do with me - was asked <p align=left>Column: 1744<p>to pay for the birds which were taken out from the Pulau Ubin farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government announced that they will&nbsp;buy all the birds and incinerate them. However, it turned out that the Government removed all the birds in the island without paying a single cent and it saved completely on the cost of incineration and the cost of culling the birds. The Poultry Import and Export Association was asked to pay for the costs&nbsp;to achieve the Government's intended objective of stopping all the small-time farmers and it does not reflect very well on the sincerity of the Government.&nbsp; It led the people to suspect</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>that the Government will not be so generous in its compensation if really culling action should be carried out in all the large-scale farms.&nbsp; Since the flu is almost over, it will be time for the Government and relevant departments to sit down and work out some sensible compensation so that the farmers will be satisfied with the terms and will lend their full support to the Government for its action, if unfortunately, in future the bird flu were to&nbsp;attack Singapore once again.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately, due to the Avian Flu, farmers were asked to implement many cost-sensitive measures, like erection of nets for the whole farm enclosure.&nbsp; They were also asked to do things to improve the standard of their farms.&nbsp; As I know, at least there are more than three farms at the moment that have a balance of three years' lease.&nbsp; Judging from the bird flu scare, it looks unlikely that the farms' lease would be extended by the AVA.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my personal opinion.&nbsp; The expenses on the improvements are just a waste of money and would not be justified if the lease is only to last for another three more years or shorter.&nbsp; If the Government is not extremely keen in keeping all these farms, why not compensate the farms with the early termination of their lease and let the <p align=left>Column: 1745<p>farmers' useful and hard-earned resources be redeployed to other businesses which receive support from the Government?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Agriculture Policy</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, in the late 80s and early 90s, the Government announced a large-scale agro-technology park development.&nbsp; At least four agro-technology parks were developed in Chua Chu Kang.&nbsp; At that point of time, the farmers did have the thinking that farming activities were being revitalised in Singapore and it was time for them to invest in the&nbsp;farms.&nbsp; At that time, seven farms, all large-scale, got into the business.&nbsp; Looking at the first measure, a few&nbsp;years ago, the Government gave the reason of pollution by the duck farms.&nbsp; Originally, we were 100% self-sufficient in the supply of ducks in Singapore.&nbsp; However, overnight, the farms closed down when their lease expired and the farms were all gone.&nbsp; In 2001, the complaints of smell from the farms led to the closure of three of the four egg farms in Sungei Tengah,&nbsp;which we were also very proud of&nbsp;as they provided 30% of the total egg consumption in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to ask&nbsp;whether the Minister has any long-term policy on the farming activities in Singapore.&nbsp;

Then, at one time, I used to buy at the supermarket <I>char siew pau.&nbsp;</I> They were very cheap - 15 cents - and I used to enjoy eating them until again somebody pointed out that these are probably made under very unhygienic conditions.&nbsp; Maybe that is why they always tasted so good.&nbsp; I find this very disturbing because, on the one hand, we ban the import of pork from Malaysia because of the Nipah virus, but we allow the pork to come in in the form of meat dumplings.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is this case of the oyster food poisoning which took place in November when more than 200 people who ate at a 5-star hotel came down with poisoning because they ate raw oysters.&nbsp; Because of that incident, we found that the oysters&nbsp;did not actually come from Australia or New Zealand, but actually came from China.&nbsp; Although we were told that investigations were underway as to what the problem was, whether it was a contamination at source or due to the handling at the hotel, we have not exactly known what has happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the AVA does a very good job in ensuring very high standards&nbsp;for our food imports, but it is near impossible to check every source of food production or food manufactured overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In England and in Germany,&nbsp;plots&nbsp;of land are set aside for retirees to begin farming as an enterprise or as a hobby.&nbsp; I am asking if the Ministry of National Development could take the lead in this with AVA, HDB, URA, SLA, to keep aside more land beyond the 1,200 hectares that I believe&nbsp;are currently made available to retirees on two levels.&nbsp; For the smaller plots the HDB dwellers could come down, potter about and go back to his flat for home consumption.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on a larger scale, for our more mobile retirees to sink roots here rather than take off to retirement homes elsewhere and form a farming entrepreneur ownership, and so develop even by-products from the products that they grow.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> We are running out of time.&nbsp; Let me try to gallop through these cuts.&nbsp; The most important question, in my opinion, was Dr Teo's:&nbsp; is eating chicken safe?&nbsp; I want to assure this House and, indeed, all Singaporeans, that eating chicken, certainly in Singapore, is safe.&nbsp; It is very, very safe, and nobody needs to have any second <p align=left>Column: 1748<p>thoughts or any reservations on that point.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Low said that the Avian Flu outbreak is almost over.&nbsp; I just want to put things in context.&nbsp; Avian Flu has been around for 100 years.&nbsp; It is not a new disease in that sense.&nbsp; What is new is that in 1997 it crossed the species barrier and affected human beings.&nbsp; And, he has quite rightly said the most feared sub-type is H5N1.&nbsp; But other sub-types as well can occasionally cross, and cause problems.&nbsp; So, the correct attitude is that whilst we must not over-react, we must not be complacent either.&nbsp; And the key is to have a responsive and proper system, so that we can make the appropriate reactions when a threat emerges.&nbsp; The key thing here is to remember that it is very contagious.&nbsp; Secondly, to also remember that early detection and effective eradication of the infected flocks or the potentially infected flocks is the most effective way to stamp out the disease.&nbsp; He asked why we would cull all the flocks in all the chicken farms.&nbsp; Let me put it to him in context again.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore we have seven poultry farms.&nbsp; All these farms are at close range to each other.&nbsp; Furthermore, they share resources in the sense that certain service trucks, certain transport and logistics arrangement, even certain feed sources, would be shared in common.&nbsp; So, if an outbreak occurs in one farm, can he, or AVA, or indeed anybody, be sure that the same breach in virus security has not occurred in any other farm?&nbsp; In our context, once this has occurred, we believe in a deliberate and systematic eradication of all the infected and potentially infected flocks, rather than to wait on tenterhooks and worry when is the next outbreak going to occur.&nbsp; Our policy objective is to eradicate the disease, to safeguard public health, to maintain confidence in Singaporeans and visitors alike.&nbsp; I would also remind him that in 1997, Hong Kong embarked on a total eradication policy and<p align=left>Column: 1749<p> the WHO has stated that this measure by Hong Kong in 1997 averted a potentially disastrous global outbreak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to touch on the allegation of double standards.&nbsp; Let us put things again in context.&nbsp; Avian Influenza affects mainly poultry.&nbsp; Why poultry?&nbsp; Because they are the most sensitive, the most susceptible to this particular infection.&nbsp; So far, all major outbreaks in the world have occurred only in the context of poultry farms, not in the context of pet birds, not in the context of bird parks.&nbsp; In the case of Singapore, if an outbreak were to occur in a susceptible species, for some reason we suddenly found that it has mutated and a certain species in the Bird Park is susceptible, of course, we will eradicate and take all the measures needed to contain that outbreak.&nbsp; So let me assure the House that there is no commercial or policy reason to have double standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I want to touch on the issue of compensation.&nbsp; If Avian Influenza breaks out in Singapore, it will be a disaster.&nbsp; It will be a disaster financially to the people involved in the trade.&nbsp; Let us not pretend otherwise.&nbsp; But, let us also be honest enough to accept that there is no way the Government can fully compensate for all the immediate and consequential business losses.&nbsp; Our approach is to say that we will share the pain and we will help bear the cost that they will incur in controlling that outbreak.&nbsp; The Government will make <I>ex-gratia</I> payments to the farmer for the live poultry which are culled, based on the estimated market value of the flocks.&nbsp; In the case of Tekong, I am glad to say that all, or almost all, the chickens were sold and they were sold at the market rate and, therefore, the issue of compensation does not arise.&nbsp; He mentioned the increased cost associated with providing bio-security, like bird-proofing the farms.&nbsp; This, we believe, is the cost of doing business and, properly, it should be paid for by the people who choose on a<p align=left>Column: 1750<p> voluntary basis to embark on chicken farming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Low also asked about our long-term policy on farming in Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has&nbsp;a very limited land resource.&nbsp; It is not possible for us to be totally self-sufficient in food.&nbsp; Our approach towards a resilient food supply is to ensure that we diversify our sources of food supply.&nbsp; As far as local farms are concerned, we will allow farming to occur in Singapore so long as land is available and, so long as the private sector finds it commercially viable to use the land for this purpose.&nbsp; Ms Braema asked if cheap farm land could be set aside for retirees.&nbsp; I think it follows from my earlier point that the private sector, including Ivy-Singh Lim, must find it commercially viable to run these farms on available land.&nbsp; We will not subsidise the land for these purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidentally, we have six agro-technology parks set aside, zones that are reserved sites in Singapore.&nbsp; This can be used for farming but I would also add that it can also be used for other compatible activities, like horse-back riding, spa resorts, camping sites, etc.&nbsp; Interested parties can bid for this land in an open tender.&nbsp; The land will be awarded to the highest bidder and who is able to make the best use of the land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would now move on to the issue on ensuring food supply safety.&nbsp; I am glad Mr Tan Soon Khoon enjoys his <I>otah</I>, his <I>pau</I> and his oysters.&nbsp; Our objective is to allow him and other Singaporeans to continue enjoying these delicacies.&nbsp; How do we ensure food safety?&nbsp; We have an integrated food safety system.&nbsp; It starts from the farm all the way to the fork.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;first to accredit the supply sources, and a lot of &nbsp;AVA officers have to spend time going to farms&nbsp;or&nbsp;factories overseas to make sure that these sources are producing things in a wholesome way and in a safe way.&nbsp; We also expect health certification by the exporting authorities in<p align=left>Column: 1751<p> the countries which are exporting the food to us.&nbsp; We have a system for the inspection of import consignments on arrival,&nbsp;and this is backed by advanced food testing capabilities.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Last week, Miss Penny Low faced the ire of 10 families in just one block of flats alone in Compassvale. In a survey in Anchorvale, 180 families responded with their predicament. Safety, noise-heavy vehicles are anyway not supposed to be used for personal transportation -&nbsp;are often used to justify the lack of attention to this problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a moment and look at it from the standpoint of the drivers. Can you seriously believe that these drivers have<p align=left>Column: 1760<p> any bargaining power with their employers over whether they get transportation to and from work, or get paid an allowance to get to work and back home, when all of Singapore is asleep? Invariably, it hurts the drivers&rsquo; pockets. Yes, each heavy vehicle comes with a parking permit when it is registered. But there is a severe mismatch of where the parking lots are and where people live and work. This parking permit cannot be a solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the options available to these drivers are disappearing. The compounds of schools, temples, churches, petrol stations where they used to have them are getting smaller and are fast disappearing as an option. The new town does not have surface car parks. Multi-storey car park is the norm. These multi-storey car parks are themselves the bane of drivers who are not even driving the big prime movers but just a van with a roof that exceeds the 2.1 metres allowed clearance for these multi-storey car parks. I feel for the effect that it has on the lifestyle of these drivers. They either park miles away from home or work and spend untold hours to commute. They hit the road before the break of dawn and get home with just the moon as company, or else play a cat-and-mouse game with traffic wardens. Invariably, paying parking fines becomes a fixed monthly outlay. And we say we pay attention to lifestyles and want more babies? &nbsp;As an MP, I too worry about the safety and noise concerns, but these can be solved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister to consider locating heavy vehicle parking at the fringe of Sengkang Town, so that at least the drivers of such vehicles have the option of a long walk or go on bicycles? This would take care of the noise and traffic issues. Or we could locate the parks, as Dr Warren Lee has just said, in the area designated for light industries. Surely, one cannot say that heavy vehicle movements to and from these industrial estates pose a safety issue.</p></P></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 1761<p>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</B> Sir, the URA works very closely with the various authorities (NParks, HDB and LTA) to ensure the sufficient provision of land for parks and sporting facilities as well as the provision of heavy vehicle parking facilities. These facilities are implemented together with the HDB&rsquo;s building programme.&nbsp; Dr Lee suggested that we find creative ways to use the land not presently needed. Indeed, we do that. Today, the grassroots organisations can approach SLA or HDB to use vacant land for interim parks and other community and recreational uses. Residents who need to use this interim land for any special purposes can always contact the advisers who can access a special portal, and the approved uses are listed in the portal.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the issue raised by Mr Wee on the provision of heavy vehicle parking lots in HDB estates, he has given us a reason, and I think it is a good reason, because heavy vehicles are not meant for personal transport. Heavy vehicles are actually factors of production and they should be parked in places designated for such purposes, in the factories or in heavy vehicle parking lots. Where possible, URA, together with LTA, tries to provide these heavy vehicle parking lots at the fringe of HDB estates. In the case of Sengkang, I understand that many residents are heavy vehicle drivers and, hence, the pressure on the MPs like Miss Penny Low and Mr Wee Siew Kim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we also have to be mindful of the residents&rsquo; concerns. The residents have complained to the press, Ministries, URA, HDB, LTA and also to MPs &ndash; perhaps not to the Member &ndash; that the presence of heavy vehicles in the vicinity of HDB car parks, initially multi-storey car parks, endangers the lives of their children and, indeed, themselves. At the same time, we are also mindful that heavy vehicles are noise polluters and emission polluters, however efficient they <p align=left>Column: 1762<p>may be. So the suggestion that we should locate these heavy vehicle parking lots in the midst of the HDB estates should be reconsidered. We have to balance the needs of the heavy vehicle drivers with that of the residents.&nbsp; We are talking about residents in the hundreds of thousands, and we are talking about heavy vehicle drivers perhaps in the hundreds. We understand the difficulty of heavy vehicle drivers of rising before dawn and going back after dark. We will try as far as possible to locate heavy vehicle parking lots near the estates.

But really what I ask for is, firstly, there is already a light industrial park planned for Sengkang and if people cite safety issues, then we have a problem with the light industrial park. Secondly, I mentioned that it is on the fringe. We have heard the comment that Sengkang is a wild west, and I do not know what noise and safety the people are talking about. &nbsp;I would like the Ministry to reconsider its position.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

At the same time, amenities such as sports stadia or swimming pools will be in short supply as they tend to be built only when there are enough residents to justify the amenities. It is a chicken-and-egg situation. I am glad that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has already mentioned that the Ministry would consider working with residents and grassroots leaders to create temporary parks, recreational facilities on these often large tracts of open ground. Done <i>gotong royong</i> style, these facilities need neither be expensive to build nor maintain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the temporary nature of these facilities, I think we need to keep matters in perspective. Even though a biking trail or an unofficial soccer pitch, or even a hobby farm, may be available for only three to five years, it will benefit a whole cohort of children in the neighbourhood and lots of residents who may feel strapped for cash to travel to other sports facilities far away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the Minister would consider this.</p></P></span></div>						<p align=left>Column: 1764<p>			<!--MP_NAME:Mr Othman Haron Eusofe--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>East</I> <I>Coast Park</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe</B>:<B>&nbsp;</B> &nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has plans to upgrade the East Coast Park in the next financial year.

In case of any problem, the information facilitates product recall and trace back to the supply source for further investigations. An errant establishment will be suspended until satisfactory remedial action has been taken, in order to ensure that they comply with the requirements.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food labels are also required to list the ingredients of the product for the benefit of people who may be allergic to some ingredients, for example, nuts. Infant food and products with a limited shelf life, for instance, perishables like dairy products and <I>tofu</I>, must be date-marked. The issue is not whether it is canned or not. The issue is the durability of the food. Retailers are held responsible and will be prosecuted and their products will be seized and destroyed if they are found to sell unwholesome products. AVA checks the labelling of food products at retail outlets, warehouses and food factories. Importers, manufacturers and retailers are subject to enforcement actions if their products do not meet these requirements. AVA has found that the pre-packed bread sold at supermarkets meets the labelling requirements because such requirements do not apply to loosely packed bread and pastry products sold at bakery shops.

The train bombing in Madrid last week was a stark reminder of how violent and senseless terrorism is and how it can happen any time, anywhere and that no country and no one is truly safe.&nbsp; Emerging evidence points to the Islamic militant network, Al-Qaeda, as the group responsible.&nbsp; Indeed, the Spanish authorities are now analysing a video tape claiming that the train bombings were Al-Qaeda&rsquo;s punishment for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>&rsquo;s support for the US-led war in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several countries have since stepped up their security after the <st1:State><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:State> attack.&nbsp; The British are deploying anti-terror marshals on trains across the country and throughout <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>'s underground network.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region> deployed 500 soldiers to key transportation hub, while the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> has also increased its rail security.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is taking steps to also beef up its security, especially the public transport security, given that we have also supported the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the war against <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

My second observation is that the geo-political situation in this region is more uncertain and fluid, as pointed out by my GPC Chairman.&nbsp; Elections in several countries, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, would have implications on this region.&nbsp; The outcome of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region> presidential election will also have implications on our policies and the different policies in this region.&nbsp; The historic impeachment of the South Korean President last week adds further uncertainty into the picture.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for his assessment on the security outlook for the region and how we are gearing up to <p align=left>Column: 1770<p>meet the expanding spectrum of national threats.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr R Ravindran (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Advances in technology will have a profound effect on the future of warfare.&nbsp; It has been said many times that generals invariably fight the war.&nbsp; For example, based on the First World War experience,<p align=left>Column: 1773<p> the Polish generals sent their horse cavalries against German tanks at the outbreak of the Second World War, and the French generals defended <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region> by building an outdated Marginot defence line, which was easily breached by German tanks punching through selected points in blitzkrieg attacks.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, the first Gulf War in 1991 and the second Gulf War in 2003 highlighted to all of us the immense changes in warfare.&nbsp; This led to a revolution in military and strategic thinking and a fundamental review of weapon procurement and military doctrines.&nbsp; Such paradigm shift is now termed as revolution in military affairs (RMA).&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, we need a paradigm shift in the SAF.&nbsp; I hope the SAF is not being tied down to old-fashioned warfare of the past, and is not bogged down by the baggage of our experience in World War II, the Malayan Emergency or even confrontation.&nbsp; More to the point, what happened to the two Gulf Wars demand a total review of the force structure, strategic concepts and operational doctrines of the SAF.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Old fashioned generals weighed down by old concepts are being replaced with forward-looking commanders.&nbsp; Are we in the SAF prepared to change and ride the tide of such unprecedented technological advances and changes?&nbsp; At the same time, SAF is facing new threats.&nbsp; In the new strategic landscape, the SAF has to contend with biological and chemical attacks, low intensity operations and terrorist attacks.&nbsp; I therefore wish to ask the Minister whether the SAF is prepared for such unconventional threats and how far is the SAF transforming itself in view of the <p align=left>Column: 1774<p>changes in technology and the strategic landscape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tan Soo Khoon--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So, I think the image of the SAF suffered somewhat during the year.&nbsp; However, the openness in which we discussed the deaths of our NSmen in Parliament shows that the Ministry is serious that it wants to be held accountable for any lapses, and this is very important, especially when we consider that, in the last 10 years, 3,000 NSmen had in fact been injured during training, and a total of 37 had died.&nbsp; We must, therefore, continue to have such open accountability.&nbsp; The availability of the SAF Hotline to report any misconduct or unhappiness in training is encouraging, but some NSmen do not know what is allowed or what is not allowed in training.&nbsp; So, they do not know if there has been a breach of training guidelines or of what the limits are.&nbsp; Then, there are some NSmen who are afraid of reporting their injuries to medical officers, as they fear they may be accused of malingering and giving excuses to skip training.&nbsp; Yet, some of these injuries may have life-long implications in the long term.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1775<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SAF has to continue to uphold its image as a professional fighting force capable of defending the nation.&nbsp;

Small groups of well-trained and well-equipped forces with superior information about the enemy forces and intentions have often tipped the balance in their own favour.&nbsp; We have a situation where the SAF can no longer count on increasing headcounts or bigger budgets alone to keep our fighting edge.&nbsp; The SAF will have to do more with less.&nbsp; While transforming itself into a force that can effectively face the challenges of these asymmetric&nbsp;warfare, unconventional warfare, defence against terrorist attacks, and keeping the peace.&nbsp; On the one hand, our soldiers will have to use more simulators while, on the other, more will be called upon to protect our own local vital installations from real threats in peace time, and even to serve overseas.&nbsp; We will need to restructure our forces, reprioritise our plans for acquisition and replacement of equipment and reskill our men to meet these new challenges.&nbsp; We will need to maintain unit cohesion and inter-unit cooperation, and improve our capability to mount joint operations on land, sea and air, even as we try to lessen the burden of reservist training on our Operationally-Ready NSmen and their employers.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We will need to reassure them, their parents and their loved ones that the SAF will conduct rigorous and challenging training while ensuring that the safety and welfare of the men are never taken lightly.&nbsp; We need to assure that the environmental hazards that our men will face, eg, infectious disease risks, will be managed and planned for as well as military risks will be planned for.&nbsp; If we do this, then I believe that all Singaporeans will do their part towards the total defence of Singapore.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> Sir, if we look at the SAF today, we will realise that it is a very different organisation from what it was when it first started.&nbsp; The SAF has over the years transformed itself into a lean and well-organised armed force that leverages heavily on technology as a force multiplier.&nbsp; This reliance on technology has given the SAF the edge that it enjoys today.&nbsp; In fact, independent analysts hold the SAF in very high regard as an effective fighting force in the region.&nbsp; The experience of the recent war in Iraq has proven the effectiveness of leveraging on technology to fight a modern war.&nbsp; This shows that we were doing the right thing in moving in the direction that we did.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, we know that the transformation was no easy task.&nbsp; It requires vision and far-sighted planning to bring these changes.&nbsp; Even before the Iraq war, I am sure our planners had an idea of how military technology is evolving, and must have thought about using information technology and smart weapons as an integral part of our defence system.&nbsp; I am grateful that MINDEF has, on its part, invested resources into making this possible.&nbsp; In fact, more than just relying on foreign technology to meet our needs, our Government has even got down to designing weapons systems and platforms to ensure that our armed forces are <p align=left>Column: 1777<p>equipped with tools to meet our own local specific requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is never an end point in a&nbsp;transformation process.&nbsp; For the SAF, the organisation is constantly evolving.&nbsp; Besides, even aside from the transformation in the way in which battles are fought, the conditions and nature of the battlefield are also evolving.&nbsp; Whereas the soldiers in the past were being prepared to fight conventional wars, in the aftermath of September 11, we are now mindful that the SAF may also have to engage in low intensity battles with enemies that may not be as easily defined.&nbsp; Such a transformation may at times require a paradigm shift in the way in which doctrines are written and training schedules are planned.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to share his vision to the extent possible of the kind of organisation that the SAF is likely to evolve&nbsp;itself into in the next 10 years, whether the SAF, as an organisation, is nimble enough to deal with changes in the nature of challenges that we face.&nbsp; For instance, can the SAF deal with low-intensity conflict as opposed to having to fight in a conventional warfare?&nbsp; Are we confident that our on-going efforts to transform the SAF will be adequate to prepare our armed forces to adequately deal with the situation when it arises?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Western alliance, comprising mainly the US and the UK, went to war with Iraq last year, almost certain that the evidence they had on hand would prove beyond doubt that the belief that President Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; So confident were the Americans that Mr Collin Powell&nbsp;went to the United Nations Security Council, believing that the photograph he had was enough to&nbsp;convince the world.&nbsp; One year on, after the invasion of Iraq and the fall of President Saddam Hussein, we are nowhere nearer to finding any weapons of mass destruction than when we first started out with.&nbsp; All they ever found were some old canisters, probably used for chemical weapons.&nbsp; These were probably remnants of the time when Iraqis wielded chemical weapons against the Iranians and the Kurds.&nbsp; There was certainly no evidence of any nuclear, biological or even chemical weapons that were ready for deployment within 40 minutes, as the British Prime Minister had led the world to believe then.&nbsp; It is becoming increasingly clear in the minds of many that there were probably no <p align=left>Column: 1779<p>weapons of mass destruction or any programme leading to the development of&nbsp;weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has become most embarrassing to political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic who have been left scrambling for an&nbsp;explanation for the failure of intelligence gathering in the run-up to the Iraqi war.&nbsp; Of course, there had been accusations of political interference in the work of intelligence officials which led to the famous BBC comment that intelligence reports had been sexed up to gain public support.&nbsp; The issue, therefore, is the extent to which the public can be assured that there is proper segregation between the work of intelligence officials and the elected leaders whose task is to take political decisions based on the outcome of intelligence reports.&nbsp; No doubt, this issue will be addressed&nbsp;in the next few months as the public enquiries in the UK and US progress.&nbsp; What has happened overseas will no doubt be relevant in Singapore.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what assurances there are for Singaporeans that our intelligence gathering is accurate and reliable, and that the work of intelligence officials will&nbsp;not be unduly hampered by the interference of any party, to avoid a repeat of what has taken place elsewhere.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For instance, the command and control of the various sensor and weapons systems onboard each frigate are achieved via an indigenously designed Combat Management System (CMS).&nbsp; This system was developed by the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) with the cooperation of its partners.&nbsp; It is the first system designed with embedded intelligence for track management, identification and weapons assignment functions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such developments keep us ahead of the pack.&nbsp;

In fact, Tim Huxley, a famed defence analyst, wrote in an article "Singapore and the Revolution in Military Affairs", that for less than $5 billion annually, MINDEF and the SAF provide Singapore with a remarkable range of military capabilities.&nbsp;

And even if MINDEF makes every effort to improve the safety environment, accidents do and will occur.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the issue is not whether or not MINDEF convenes an enquiry each time an accident takes place or training standards are reviewed regularly.&nbsp; What matters is how we rank, in terms of safety standards.&nbsp; It would help the public if MINDEF would perhaps have a benchmark that measures their safety level against the training safety level in&nbsp; comparable armed forces elsewhere.&nbsp; This would provide a better comparison on the extent to which MINDEF has paid attention to training safety and would also, at the same time, provide much assurance to parents that their children are in safe hands.&nbsp; I cannot reasonably expect my son, when he goes to National Service, not to be in danger.&nbsp; But if I know that the odds of getting hurt in&nbsp;a<p align=left>Column: 1787<p> road accident are higher than when he is training under the SAF, for me, speaking as a parent,&nbsp;I will be very much assured indeed.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, the recent explosion incident&nbsp;at the Armour Training Centre and the training deaths last year highlight the need for an effective audit system for training safety.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, as part of the review of training and safety systems, several measures have been proposed to enhance the SAF's audit system.

I also want to ask the Minister about another measure that has been proposed, which is for benchmarking purposes, that the Army is considering engaging an independent external agency to validate the effectiveness of the safety and audit systems.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether there has been any decision on this and whether external agencies have been engaged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to add a point to what my colleagues have said about human errors.&nbsp; It is true that human error is hard to predict and control.&nbsp; But we can try to minimise it.&nbsp; But on the other hand, in minimising it, in seeking to ensure safety, I hope that our SAF&nbsp;will not swing to the other end, be so safe that our training lacks the vigour and toughness that it needs to produce a strong SAF.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Chairman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman:</B> Dr Warren Lee is not here.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang is also not here.&nbsp; Dr Ong.</P></span></div>									<p align=left>Column: 1788<p><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<P><I>SAVERS Scheme</I></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Ong Chit Chung</B>:&nbsp; Sir, some years ago, the SAVERS Scheme was introduced by MINDEF with much fanfare.&nbsp; The SAVERS Scheme aims to give flexibility and a good return to the regular officers of the SAF, upon their retirement or completion of service.&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that some regular officers have lamented that they are not&nbsp;getting good returns from the SAVERS Scheme.&nbsp; They feel let down.&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wish to ask the Minister if the SAVERS Scheme has lived up to its expectation, and whether the SAVERS Scheme should be revised in view of the recent results.&nbsp; The point is: what can the serving officers in the SAF look forward to in the future?</P></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Chairman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman:</B> Dr Tan Cheng Bock is not here.&nbsp; RAdm Teo.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</B> Sir, first of all, I would like to thank Dr Ong Chit Chung, Ms Irene Ng, Mr Ravindran and other hon. Members for their comments and questions on this critical issue of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s defence and security.&nbsp; What they have said reflects a general recognition that our strategic environment is a difficult one, and the challenges we face in our efforts to enhance <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s security have also become more complex.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spectrum of missions that the SAF has to deal with has expanded in recent years. The SAF will have to meet these increased demands for many years to come.&nbsp; In the area of non-conventional threats, the tide of the extremist ideology which is the well-spring of catastrophic terrorism shows no sign of abating.&nbsp; More than two years after the September 11 attacks, Al-Qaeda and its affiliates, even in our region, are still actively recruiting<p align=left>Column: 1789<p> and training, and plotting to launch attacks, after having succeeded in two devastating attacks in <st1:place>Bali</st1:place> and <st1:City><st1:place>Jakarta</st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp; Many Southeast Asian countries are on the hit list, including <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The Government's efforts to prevent such attacks and to protect our people are of the highest priority because the danger is clear and present.&nbsp; The SAF works closely with the Home Team and other Ministries, with the DPM and Co-ordinating Minister for Security and Defence, Dr Tony Tan, coordinating these efforts. These efforts require the commitment of MINDEF and SAF resources, manpower and capabilities, for example, to protect key installations from air, sea and land threats. It also requires ideas and research and development (R&amp;D) to deal with scenarios that are very different from what we have been used to, such as to protect civil airliners against surface-to-air missiles, maritime terrorism and biological, chemical and radiological threats.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng has asked what we are doing about beefing up security on our trains, in view of what has happened in <st1:State><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:State>.&nbsp; I should say that we do not look just at particular events, but we have to look at this in a comprehensive way. We adopt a comprehensive approach to national security, rather than taking piecemeal measures and the security of our MRT system is something that has been carefully considered in our national security plans, particularly by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Transport.&nbsp; It requires a combination of good intelligence to identify threats before they can launch their attacks, hardening potential targets with heightened security measures, imposing very tight controls on the movements of explosives and other dangerous materials, good border controls for immigration and customs.&nbsp; But even with all these efforts, we cannot afford to be complacent and the security agencies will be maintaining a high level of alert as long as there is a potential threat.&nbsp; But our defence efforts also require Singaporeans <p align=left>Column: 1790<p>to be alert, as the total defence of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is not complete without participation of every Singaporean.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we will have to continue to work with other governments because no country, on its own, can effectively counter this transnational threat that respects no borders.&nbsp; Cooperation in the form of intelligence exchange, is particularly important, as Mr Sin Boon Ann has suggested.&nbsp; Our intelligence agencies are recognised by their counterparts for their professionalism and ability and I have no doubt of their capability and their ability to maintain the independence of their advice and reporting.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="13" Minute="45">1.45 pm</st1:time></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s intelligence agencies have good ties with friendly counterparts worldwide and these links have reaped significant results such as the arrest of key terrorists in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

It requires international cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is working with the countries in our region, as well as other countries which share these security concerns, such as <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; At the bilateral level, we have been cooperating with <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> in conducting coordinated patrols in a designated area of the waters in the Singapore Straits for many years.&nbsp; This cooperation has been very successful in tackling the problem of piracy.&nbsp; With the exception of a short period, in 1998-99, when <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> was going through a particularly difficult period, there have been no pirate attacks in this area since<p align=left>Column: 1791<p> the coordinated patrols started with <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1992.&nbsp; Within <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s own waters, the Navy and Police Coast Guard have taken various measures which were detailed last week by my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, in this House.&nbsp; I agree with Ms Ng that more needs to be done in this area, and the inter-ministry Maritime Security Task Force, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of Defence, is studying what further measures can be taken.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction also requires international cooperation.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> has contributed to the global counter-proliferation effort by tightening up our export controls and participating in the Container Security Initiative.&nbsp; The SAF has been taking part in the multinational Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).&nbsp; Our LST, for example, participated in Exercise Sea Saber, a US-led Maritime Interdiction Operation exercise in the <st1:place>Arabian Sea</st1:place> in January that involved 12 countries.&nbsp; We will be observers in a German Customs exercise in <st1:place>Frankfurt</st1:place>, an Italian exercise in the <st1:place>Mediterranean</st1:place>, and a French air exercise in <st1:City><st1:place>Paris</st1:place></st1:City>, over the next three months.&nbsp; The SAF is also looking at hosting a multilateral PSI exercise in the future.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are committed to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, especially as the confluence of the two threats, the possibility of such weapons falling into the hands of terrorists is a real one, and there would be untold consequences of such an attack on a city-state like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The threats of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction proliferation underscore how our national borders no longer are the boundaries of our security.&nbsp; As a small country which is so open and connected to the rest of the world, developments elsewhere in our region and <p align=left>Column: 1792<p>even further afield will have repercussions for our security.&nbsp; And this is a key reason why we have sent SAF contingents to take part in the UN peacekeeping mission in Timor Leste and the coalition mission for the reconstruction of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Instability in Timor Leste would have had serious implications for the rest of our region, and it was important that we play our part to help to restore stability to this young nation.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sending an LST and a C-130 transport aircraft to the multinational mission in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we recognise that there are significant risks involved.&nbsp; But restoring stability in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> and re-integrating it into the global community is vital for a stable <st1:place>Middle East</st1:place> and for global stability in general.&nbsp; If the multinational mission in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> were to fail, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> could quickly become a hotbed of terrorist activity which would embolden terrorists all over the world.&nbsp; The consequences of this will, sooner or later, spread to our region and arrive at our shores.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked for details of our participation in multinational missions.&nbsp; The criteria for deciding on our participation would, first of all, be the strategic considerations I have just spoken about. In addition, the SAF conducts a careful study of the operational requirements of each mission to determine what we can contribute which would add the most value to the mission.&nbsp; Singapore is not in a position to send large numbers of troops, but we can contribute SAF personnel and assets that can make a useful contribution, such as a company of combat peacekeepers, a medical team, a helicopter detachment, and a Force Commander in UNMISET in East Timor; and an LST doing security patrols in the Arabian Gulf and a C-130 flying supply and medevac missions into Iraq.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all, about 1,500 SAF soldiers, sailors and airmen have participated in the Timor Leste and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> missions.&nbsp; The<p align=left>Column: 1793<p> personnel deployed on such overseas missions are regular servicemen, but we also accept National Servicemen when they volunteer.&nbsp; Many full-time National Servicemen came forward to volunteer to serve in Timor Leste and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Those who were accepted converted to regular service for the period of the overseas mission.&nbsp; They served with great professionalism and did <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> proud.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF's participation in these operational missions is valuable for enhancing the professionalism of our personnel and reinforces their confidence in their equipment and in their training.&nbsp; They operate under difficult conditions, facing real-life challenges and dangers.&nbsp; Our LST spent a total of 42 days on station in the Gulf, queried over 250 ships over these 42 days and boarded and searched over 70 of them, which was almost two a day.&nbsp; Our C-130 commenced operations in the Gulf from 9th February and is tasked to fly missions into <st1:City><st1:place>Baghdad</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:City><st1:place>Kirkuk</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:City><st1:place>Mosul</st1:place></st1:City>, Tallil and <st1:City><st1:place>Basra</st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp; Our men and women work closely with other armed forces and, in the process, learn from as well as benchmark themselves against their foreign counterparts.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I was heartened when the New Zealand Defence Chief told me recently that the SAF peacekeepers in Timor Leste had been highly professional and an asset to the New Zealand Defence Force battalion to which our unit was attached.&nbsp; The New Zealanders are seasoned and highly regarded peacekeepers.&nbsp; So this was a worthy endorsement.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as you can see, we have responsibilities and contributions to make as a responsible member of the international community.&nbsp; We have to get involved in international issues which have implications for our security.&nbsp; And, we have to work with other countries to fight transnational threats.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1794<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peacekeeping, counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation are relatively new roles for the SAF.&nbsp; They add to, and contribute to, but do not supersede the fundamental mission of the SAF.&nbsp; The SAF is, first and foremost, for the defence of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The SAF is the defender of our sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> wants positive relations and mutually beneficial cooperation with our ASEAN partners and friends.&nbsp; In MINDEF, we actively pursue this through our policy of defence diplomacy.&nbsp; Apart from building closer defence relations with our ASEAN neighbours, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement with <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in October last year, and we are discussing a Framework Agreement for a Strategic Cooperation Partnership in defence and security with the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while we pursue defence diplomacy, we must recognise that our strategic environment remains fraught with uncertainties.&nbsp; The flux which has characterised the regional situation over the past few years has not entirely settled.&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung has reminded us of the uncertainties that we must always be prepared for.&nbsp; When things are going well, we should not be too elated or become complacent.&nbsp; Nor should we be too disheartened or discouraged when things take a turn for the worse.&nbsp; The SAF provides us with the confidence to face any eventuality with equanimity.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we have always been prepared to make steady investments in our defence, in both good times and bad times, we have been able to maintain an even keel whether there are smiles all around or we are being harangued.&nbsp; We can calmly carry on with our lives in the face of pressures or even saber-rattling.&nbsp; The SAF gives us that political room to confidently proceed with policies which best serve <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s interests instead of being forced to dance to the tune of<p align=left>Column: 1795<p> others.&nbsp; The SAF is the insurance policy that allows us to navigate steadily and securely.&nbsp; It provides the solid foundation for our economic development and social progress.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to assure Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Ravindran and Dr Maliki that the operational readiness of the SAF is one of our highest priorities.&nbsp; The SAF cannot be an effective deterrent unless it is operationally ready.&nbsp; The modernisation and upgrading of our capabilities is an ongoing process, carried out on the basis of sensible professional considerations.&nbsp; Should our servicemen ever be called to battle, they must have the weaponry and equipment that give them the advantage.&nbsp; Our training is serious and rigorous.&nbsp; There is a cycle of exercises to test our doctrines, our weapons and equipment, and our men, and to do all this at different unit levels.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also carry out regular mobilisation exercises.&nbsp; Dr Maliki will be pleased to know that the turnout rate in the SAF's mobilisation exercises is consistently 95% or higher, and often close to 100%.&nbsp; Civil resource mobilisation exercises have also recorded similarly high positive result.&nbsp; This means that our units will be fully manned within six hours of recall and ready to do their duty, armed with capabilities which give us a significant edge over any potential adversaries.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would now like to turn to what is the key initiative in MINDEF, one which we have embarked on to ensure our security for the future and not just to defend against today's threat.&nbsp; While we maintain our operational readiness, we are also looking ahead and developing capabilities to enable the SAF to stay ahead in the next decade and beyond.&nbsp; The <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> war last year showed us how the revolution in military affairs will change the way in which wars are fought.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 1796<p>devastating effect of precision strike, for instance, was decisive.&nbsp; In World War II, it was estimated that it took 9,000 bombs brought out by waves of bombers to ensure a successful strike against one strategic target such as a command HQ or a key bridge.&nbsp; In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region> war, just one aircraft flying a single sortie could destroy several strategic targets by dropping one or two precision-guided bombs with pin-point accuracy on each target.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was also possible because the US and coalition forces had superior information of the battlefield, made possible by the latest communications, network and sensor technologies.&nbsp; Such technological possibilities - and there are many other exciting areas of technological developments - will fundamentally change the nature of warfare in the future.&nbsp; The advantage in the battlefield of the future lies with the force that can harness technology to make maximum use of these transformational capabilities.&nbsp; Platforms, manned and unmanned, weapons and sensors that are fully networked into such a fighting system will have their combat power magnified many times.&nbsp; Tanks or ships or aircraft operating on their own, which are not so networked and which are capable of operating only in the conventional way, may find that they are merely targets.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transformation of the SAF to exploit these rapidly emerging possibilities is a strategic imperative.&nbsp; But, it is not something that can be achieved overnight.&nbsp; To introduce new concepts of operations and new technologies requires experimentation and research and development.&nbsp;

We recently set up a Future System Directorate to take the lead in exploring and experimenting with how technology can be harnessed to develop superior and innovative concepts.&nbsp; MINDEF considers this effort so critical that we have set aside 1% of the defence budget for experimentation, over and above the 4% to 5% we set aside each year for research and development (R&amp;D).&nbsp; The newly created SAF Centre for Military Experimentation is already conducting various experiments in a virtual environment.&nbsp; The SAF also started conducting experiments outside the laboratory, during exercises, to test out new concepts under real-life conditions.&nbsp; For instance, when I visited <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region> last year, I was able to see some experiments with new command and control concepts and systems for future land battles fielded for the SAF's Exercise Wallaby.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While MINDEF will continue to modernise the SAF, such as through the acquisition of the Next Generational Fighter, the effort in transformation will eventually see a third generation SAF emerging over the longer term.&nbsp; This will be an SAF that has enhanced capabilities through exploitation of new concepts and technologies, an ability to fight across a wider spectrum of operations, flexible, and much more efficient in the use of resources.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF has, for many years now, been exploiting technology as a force multiplier and investing significantly in R&amp;D locally as well.&nbsp; We have built up many centres of excellence in a number of high pay-off strategic transformation technologies&nbsp; -&nbsp; such as comprehensive awareness, network-centric warfare, electronic warfare, and precision strike&nbsp; -&nbsp; in the Defence Science and Technology<p align=left>Column: 1798<p> Agency, DSO National Laboratories, and Singapore Technologies Engineering.&nbsp; Our local laboratories and industry have a solid depository of the technologies that are needed for the future.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I am unable to describe many of the remarkable achievements and capabilities because they are classified, I can say that some of these are in technologies one reads about on the war in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; But given the importance of their work in developing the third generation SAF, MINDEF intends to showcase some of these technologies at an exhibition later this year that will coincide with the Defence Technology Prize Award ceremony.&nbsp; In addition, I would be happy to invite Members for a visit to the Defence Science and Technology Agency to view some of these technologies.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the key advantages that we have is that we are fortunate that we have well educated soldiers who can easily master the technologically sophisticated weapons and equipment.&nbsp; We also have a strong science and technology base and a solid R&amp;D set-up.&nbsp; These are things which no country can create overnight, and which we are fortunate that we have built up both nationally and within our defence establishment and industry over many years.&nbsp; The implications for the SAF are profound.&nbsp; It means that we will not be held back by numbers.&nbsp; A small population will not be a constraint on our ability to defend ourselves and to deter would-be aggressors.&nbsp; Our technological edge and our transformational capabilities will not only neutralise but more than compensate for this.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the transformation of the SAF is a critical initiative.&nbsp; It is an effort to make sure that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is safe not just for today, but for our children and our children's children.&nbsp; That is why we must continue to invest a portion of the defence budget for transformation, for <p align=left>Column: 1799<p>research and development.&nbsp; That is why the Government is prepared to invest a significant share of the budget in MINDEF.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining operational readiness and transformation are both key priorities for the SAF.&nbsp; One priority, operational readiness, ensures that the SAF can carry out the missions required of it to defend <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> against the spectrum of threats to our security&nbsp; -&nbsp; a spectrum which has grown both in range and complexity.&nbsp; The other priority, transformation, ensures that the SAF continues to be a credible deterrent for many years to come, sustaining the clear edge over potential adversaries, equipped with the capabilities to fight the wars of the future.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am happy to note the firm support for defence investment which has been expressed here today by several hon. Members.&nbsp; The firm commitment of our people to the defence and security of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> has allowed the Government to maintain a steady and prudent course over many years in the development of our defence capabilities.&nbsp; Ours is not a feast or famine approach.&nbsp; We do not splurge in good times nor do we cut back and leave ourselves exposed in difficult times.&nbsp; Defence capabilities cannot be built up in fits and starts.&nbsp; Singaporeans understand that the optimal development of defence capabilities takes time and careful planning with a long-term horizon.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defence is not an optional extra for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp; -&nbsp; it is critical for a small state for which there will be no second chance if we lose the first battle.&nbsp; Defence spending is the largest part of our budget by far, reflecting the importance the Government and people attach to ensuring <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s security and the seriousness we put into the effort.&nbsp; The Government is committed to spending up to 6% of GDP on defence.&nbsp; We have been spending between 4.5% and 5% for several years <p align=left>Column: 1800<p>now. MINDEF has requested only for what is needed to ensure our defence, and has not always asked for the full amount.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will keep to this policy.&nbsp; MINDEF is committed to prudent spending.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to elaborate on some of the measures MINDEF and the SAF have adopted to stretch each dollar of our defence expenditure to get maximum value.&nbsp; The MINDEF Productivity and Innovation Committee is chaired by the Minister of State for Defence.&nbsp; The MINDEF Economy Drive Committee indeed has been in place since 1976.&nbsp; Over the last few years, the Committee has helped MINDEF to make cost savings of an average of $125 million a year.&nbsp; Last year, the saving was $195 million, or 2.37% of the defence budget.&nbsp; The savings are effected without compromising operational readiness and effectiveness and allow these resources to be ploughed back to develop other areas of defence.&nbsp; MINDEF's <st1:Street><st1:address>Economy Drive</st1:address></st1:Street> effort is the analogue of what the civil service has adopted in its <st1:Street><st1:address>Economy Drive</st1:address></st1:Street> campaign.&nbsp; At the individual level, a strong culture of cost consciousness and striving for improvement is encouraged.&nbsp; In the last quarter alone, the SAF suggestions scheme yielded cost savings of $62.7 million.&nbsp; This amounted to $144 of savings for every dollar that MINDEF and the SAF awarded servicemen for the suggestions that they put up.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also been able to leverage on technology to increase productivity and stretch our defence dollar.&nbsp; For instance, the SAF uses some of the most advanced simulators in the world.&nbsp; These simulators have improved training effectiveness in such areas as armour and marksmanship training, flight training, and navy procedural and tactical training.&nbsp; They have both increased the effectiveness of our forces and reduced the cost of training.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At force structure level, we have stretched our defence dollar by upgrading<p align=left>Column: 1801<p> our platforms where possible, and replacing them only when they are no longer cost-effective to deploy.&nbsp; Our A-4 fighter aircraft and missile gunboats would have been upgraded several times and been in service for 25 to 30 years by the time they are replaced.&nbsp; In fact, they are older than most of the servicemen who serve on them.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In manpower productivity, our artillery guns are a good example.&nbsp; In earlier days, we needed 12 men to operate each 155 mm gun.&nbsp; Then we developed locally our FH-2000 which needed only eight men.&nbsp; Last month, I was in New Zealand with Dr Ong where we carried out the first live firing exercise of the Primus, our Singapore Technologies built self-propelled 155 mm howitzer which has improved mobility, faster response time and more lethal firepower. It requires a crew of only four National Servicemen.&nbsp; Over a decade, we have increased manpower productivity three-fold for our artillery guns.&nbsp; We were able to do so through innovation in operational thinking and engineering, and also because we could leverage on the increasing proportion of A-level and Diploma qualified men in each cohort to operate these systems.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members have asked about the effect of a lower birth rate.&nbsp; This is not a new challenge for the SAF.&nbsp; The Ministry of Defence and SAF have had a policy of zero growth in regular manpower establishment since 1986 while cutting down on the requirement for full-time National Servicemen.&nbsp; This is possible despite the greater demands on the SAF and the deployment of more capabilities, because of productivity improvements and constant attention to restructuring in both front-line units as well as support units.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outsourcing is one important cost-saving measure.&nbsp; For instance, Members may not be aware, but we now do our air-grading, ie, how we identify those with <p align=left>Column: 1802<p>flying potential, in a place called <st1:place>Tamworth</st1:place> in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; It is a commercial arrangement where we do not even own the aircraft.&nbsp; We provide the key people to do the assessment but we do not own the aircraft and we do not maintain the aircraft.&nbsp; The savings from doing our air-grading in <st1:place>Tamworth</st1:place>, instead of the previous way of maintaining a fleet of our own trainer aircraft, has resulted in savings of $7 million a year.&nbsp; Yet another example is the maintenance of our C-130 aircraft for the operation in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Members may not realise that the maintenance of the C-130 has actually been outsourced and together with our pilots and crewmen operating in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>, are ST Aerospace technicians who service the aircraft when the aircraft returns from a mission.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other initiatives which MINDEF has pioneered in the civil service to cut costs.&nbsp; One example is how we commercialised our logistics through the setting up of the Army Logistics Base.&nbsp; In a private financing initiative arrangement, a commercial company put in the investment and MINDEF assured it of a multi-year contract.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address Mr Steve Chia's comments, all investments in new capabilities go through stringent assessments of requirements in relation to the SAF's missions and war-fighting strategies.&nbsp; Our current programme to select a New Fighter Replacement is a case in point.&nbsp; It is being watched closely by the aerospace industry and other air forces because, as the <I>Financial Times</I> said in an article last year, "much of the intensity is due to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s reputation as a 'reference customer', one of a handful of countries that carry weight because of the stringency and transparency of their procurement process."</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when we buy weapons and we look at them, our engineers and our people do so very seriously and with a<p align=left>Column: 1803<p> keen eye to cost-effectiveness, to make sure that we make the most of our defence dollar.&nbsp; Our engineers and procurement officers ensure that we get the most cost-effective systems, and we undertake creative sourcing, strategic cost previews and cost audits.&nbsp; As an example, we started using reverse auctions for procurement in 2001, not something always that our suppliers like or enjoy. This procurement method has yielded an average 10% savings over traditional methods.&nbsp; We have activated about $100 million worth of reverse</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Taken together, they give the Ministry of Defence a real strategic advantage by ensuring that we get maximum value for each and every defence dollar that this House votes for MINDEF.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="14" Minute="15">2.15 pm</st1:time></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, Mr Sin Boon Ann, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Ms Irene Ng and others - Dr Tan Cheng Bock is not here, but he mentioned this to me outside the House - raised the issue of training and safety.&nbsp; The interest in this subject and the concerns that have been expressed are fully understandable and well placed given that almost every Singaporean family has a son or husband, or other male relative, who is a SAF serviceman doing National Service.&nbsp; I would like to reiterate the assurance I gave Parliament last October after the tragic deaths of three SAF servicemen doing training.&nbsp; The SAF will train our servicemen hard and train them realistically for the defence of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but we will never compromise on safety nor risk the lives of our servicemen during their training.&nbsp; I am heartened by the very mature response of Singaporeans and Members of this House.&nbsp; Singaporeans <p align=left>Column: 1804<p>understand the need for the SAF to have tough and realistic training.&nbsp; Many have told me so.&nbsp; But they also expect the training to be conducted safely, and rightly so.&nbsp; They must also have the confidence that if, in spite of the procedures and checks in place, an incident does occur, that MINDEF and the SAF will deal with it professionally and in as open a manner as possible, to uncover any problems and shortcomings, learn from them and prevent a recurrence.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF has completed a full review of its training safety system.&nbsp; The review affirmed that we have in place a strong safety system to support our training.&nbsp; The safety structures, processes and procedures that had been developed over the years are robust.&nbsp; The review also found that for the safety system to work most effectively, there must also be a strong safety culture.&nbsp; This has been pointed out by Members of this House - Dr Ong, Mr Tan and others.&nbsp; And this is one of the areas of focus of the SAF's efforts to further improve training safety.&nbsp; The enhancement of a safety culture includes emphasising openness, command responsibility and an attitude of performing one's job professionally and safely.&nbsp; Safety hotlines have been installed in all three Services to encourage feedback.&nbsp; The SAF has also taken steps to ensure that not just accidents, but near-accidents are thoroughly investigated and lessons learned from them.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides enhancing the safety culture, the SAF has also improved the dissemination of safety information within its ranks.&nbsp; A knowledge management system for safety information is currently being set up.&nbsp; The SAF is also studying trend forecasting methods to anticipate and address potential safety problems before they arise.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The review of the training safety system included a full review of lesson plans to ensure that they are up to date.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1805<p> To make sure that training is actually conducted in accordance with the lesson plans, we have stepped up senior commander visits and audits by the Service inspectorates.&nbsp; All instructors and all army commanders now undergo safety-related training before they take up their posts, so that they are well equipped for field training.&nbsp; In addition, all three Services have beefed up their inspectorates and safety sections with additional staff.&nbsp; They are also looking into how best to engage external safety auditors so that we may further improve training safety.&nbsp; We are also benchmarking SAF safety standards against those of established armed forces.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The review concluded that medical coverage for SAF training was adequate.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we have made a number of improvements to the medical support system.&nbsp; Training centres now have advanced resuscitation equipment, such as defribillators.&nbsp; Additional training for first responder resuscitation is conducted for both medical and non-medical personnel.&nbsp; This means that more and better firstline medical response can be provided in the field.&nbsp; The training for medical vocationalists has been revised so that our doctors and medics are current in advanced life-saving skills.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF is working hard to maintain high training and safety standards.&nbsp; The review that we have just completed has led to several measures being implemented, as I have enumerated.&nbsp; But safety has to be a constant, ongoing concern.&nbsp; And I assure Members that attention to safety will continue to be of the highest priority for the SAF.&nbsp; We have a substantially good system, but we know that we can always try harder and improve, and we will.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on a related matter raised by Dr Ong, the issue of compensation for SAF servicemen was raised in Parliament last October.&nbsp; I informed Parliament then that MINDEF would carry out a review of the <p align=left>Column: 1806<p>compensation issue.&nbsp; MINDEF compensates servicemen for death and injury sustained due to military service in accordance with the SAF Regulations.&nbsp; While the basic compensation provided is based on the provisions in the Workmen's Compensation Act, MINDEF also has the flexibility to pay up to 30% in additional compensation in cases where circumstances merit this.&nbsp; In exceptional circumstances, MINDEF has also paid compensation beyond the 30% cap.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principles that MINDEF applies in computing the compensation amount are consistent with the legal principles applied by the civil courts in assessing damages for injuries and deaths.&nbsp; I am satisfied that MINDEF's current framework is essentially adequate to provide fair and reasonable compensation to our servicemen.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have directed MINDEF to formalise these arrangements into a framework for compensation.&nbsp; This framework will provide greater clarity for decisions on compensation for deaths and injuries sustained due to military service according to the merits of each case.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I have asked that for the purpose of compensation, MINDEF treats full-time National Servicemen and NSmen on par with regular soldiers.&nbsp; This means that for deaths due to service, we will also provide a lump sum pension of a minimum of one year's equivalent of a regular's pay in addition to the compensation.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from compensation, there is also a range of additional benefits, such as welfare grants from the SAF Benevolent Fund and a dependants' pension depending on the family's financial circumstances.&nbsp; There is also a comprehensive group insurance scheme which our soldiers are encouraged to take up.&nbsp; It provides coverage of up to $400,000 at affordable premiums of $16 per month for every $100,000 of coverage.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1807<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF knows that no amount of compensation or benefits will alleviate the grief or make up for the loss to the serviceman's family.&nbsp; However, with these improvements to our compensation framework, we will be in a better position to compensate our servicemen's families as fairly as possible.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked about the SAVER Scheme.&nbsp; We have a policy of keeping the SAF young.&nbsp; With the threat environment and war-fighting becoming ever more complex, the timely renewal of the SAF leadership is key if we want to keep the SAF dynamic, vigorous and forward-looking, with a constant supply of fresh ideas and receptiveness to new concepts and change. This is the best way to make sure that our generals are always prepared to fight the next war and not be trapped trying to fight the last war.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1998, MINDEF implemented a 23-year career for our officers.&nbsp; This maintains a balance between the requirement for experience while ensuring timely leadership renewal.&nbsp; This also means that the individual officer is still young enough to acquire the skills and knowledge to make a switch in career, and he has enough working years left to have a meaningful second career.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support this new career structure, MINDEF introduced the SAVER Scheme.&nbsp; This scheme offers our officers accelerated career advancement and a very good salary and benefits package.&nbsp; A key feature of SAVER is a generous superannuation scheme to support their transition to a civilian career when they leave the SAF.&nbsp; This is designed such that an SAF officer in his 23-year career would earn close to 75% of what his private sector counterpart would earn in a 40-year career.&nbsp; Since its inception, the SAVER Scheme has met its objectives of<p align=left>Column: 1808<p> improved recruitment and retention of officers and timely leadership renewal.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, MINDEF is enhancing the career transition programme to provide better support to those officers who are leaving as the employment environment in recent years has been more difficult.&nbsp; The programme offers career counselling, networking opportunities and outplacement services in preparation for their career transition.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr Ong has also referred to some complaints by retired officers that they did not get good returns from the SAVER Scheme.&nbsp; Let me exaplain.&nbsp; The SAVER fund is no different from other pension funds which are invested, and we have explained to our officers that they should take the long-term view.&nbsp; In fact, the returns are slightly higher than the benchmark which the fund compared itself to.&nbsp; SAVER benefits are invested with a view to giving good returns over the long term, based on a strategy of balanced asset allocation.&nbsp; There may however be a few years when the performance of the fund is negative, and there may be a small minority who leave the SAF at that point where the returns are negative.&nbsp; The performance of the fund, as I have said, so far has been better than our benchmark, and better than numerous established pension funds in the market.&nbsp; Our officers also have the option to move.&nbsp; They can move their retirement benefits into a more conservative portfolio two years before their retirement, depending on their risk appetite.&nbsp; But of course, if they do that, and if the investment makes exceptional gains in those two years, then they will not benefit from those exceptional gains.&nbsp; So those are the risk return benefits. However, having now run the fund for about six years, MINDEF is reviewing the fund structure to fine-tune it to see whether there are more options that can be developed to meet the needs of the<p align=left>Column: 1809<p> fund members at the various points of their career.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, good and strong leadership in the SAF is vital and cannot be compromised.&nbsp; MINDEF will ensure that our employment schemes continue to attract officers of quality which can meet the demands required of those who shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding our nation's defence and security.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am most heartened by the degree of support which hon. Members have shown for the need to ensure <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s defence and security.&nbsp; Underlying many of the points which they have raised is the recognition that security is the basic building block of our nation's well-being.&nbsp;

<B><B>Mr</B> Arthur Fong (West Coast)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, two years ago, my parliamentary colleague Dr Chong Weng Chiew made a plea for a&nbsp;review for the reduction of the length of National Service term.&nbsp; He argued that, given the advancement of modern technology and the lesser reliance on manpower, would it not be possible for the length of our National Service to be shortened.&nbsp; Sometime later, the then&nbsp;Minister for Defence, DPM Dr Tony Tan, informed this House that MINDEF had studied the request in detail and responded to Dr Chong's plea.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to take up this issue again for several reasons.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, MINDEF had anticipated and made preparations in response to our falling birth rate.&nbsp; For instance, I understand that MINDEF is relying more on technology, so much so that the building of assault bridges, for example, no longer requires or relies on a lot of manpower.&nbsp; We have also added more advanced <p align=left>Column: 1811<p>weaponries that trim manpower needs tremendously.&nbsp; Hence, in this regard, the utilisation of our NSmen need not be a compact two years.&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we are addressing the falling birth rate, but we cannot be sure of how it will turn out.&nbsp; That being the case, it makes our smaller manpower pool all that more precious.&nbsp; Our youths today face competition not just from amongst their peers, but on the global arena for jobs.&nbsp; Our young graduates, as it is, compete against their peers from some countries with a very much lower starting salary, as they hit the job market two to two and a half years later than, say,&nbsp;a Malaysian, European, Indian or American professional hired here on local terms.&nbsp; Although these and other nationals can augment our pool of professionals and perhaps even given a PR later, our very own young men who bear the responsibility of national defence start a peg below these other foreigners.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, our current employment situation, where workers above the age of 45 are having difficulty in securing re-employment, means our youths need to be economically productive to their family as soon as possible.&nbsp; Many of these NSmen have parents who are in this age group and who are worried that, if they lose their jobs, they will have problems supporting their children through university after their NS stint.&nbsp; A few of such families have described the time when their children are still in NS a&nbsp;very stressed period, as some of them are saying that they are on borrowed time, hoping not to get retrenched or getting the pink slip.&nbsp; Although there was a review and a welcome revision of NS allowances recently, and notwithstanding the importance of national defence, given Singapore's unique situation, the families of many of these NSmen are worried and would like to see their children launch into their career or further studies earlier,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1812<p>thereby relieving some of the stresses and burdens of the families.</P></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</B> Sir, I would like to suggest that we introduce National Service for our female citizens for a 1-year period, starting from&nbsp;18 years old.&nbsp; I would suggest that our girls do basic military training for three months, including the use of weapons, and the balance nine months be taken up for basic nursing and nursing related training.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is not a new thing for women to do National Service.&nbsp; Recently, the Malaysian government made the girls there do national Service, and the girls in Israel do national service as equals to their men.&nbsp; I believe that basic training in nursing is good for all our girls.&nbsp; It shall equip them to be better and more mature women, and to cope better with life generally.&nbsp; After a period of training in nursing, I believe our girls can manage emergency situations better.&nbsp; They shall also be better housewives.&nbsp; It shall, in a way, prepare our girls to embrace motherhood more readily to help in the procreation policy.&nbsp; The basic training in nursing will make it easier for our girls to take up full-time nursing as a career, and to be able to fill the many vacancies in our hospitals.&nbsp; Even if they do not take up full-time nursing, the training can make them deal with life better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we do not have a war situation like in Israel, and there is no need to involve the women to do National Service in&nbsp;combat duties.&nbsp; Our girls, after they complete their 1-year stint in National Service, can be deployed in non-combatant duties, such as in the medical corps, administration or logistics.&nbsp; They can thus relieve a lot of our men from carrying those non-combatant duties.&nbsp; I think, generally, our girls would not object to do 1-year National Service.&nbsp; They get to mix with the guys, and they are in a better position to find a boyfriend or a husband.</p></P></span></div>				<p align=left>Column: 1813<p>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</B> Sir, Mr Arthur Fong has raised the issue of the declining birth rate on National Service.&nbsp; I support his concern.&nbsp; The declining TFR highlighted by the DPM in his Budget Statement has its implications for defence a decade or so down the road.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, ours is a national service doctrine, based on full-time National Servicemen.&nbsp; Furthermore, the full-time NS obligation of two to two and a half years, one of the longest in the world, was established years ago, based on the requirement to maintain a standing force of a certain size.&nbsp; As the number of NSmen has declined from the 1960s to now, how do we maintain a standing force of a certain size must have occupied the minds of the MINDEF establishment.&nbsp; As the number of recruits drops, to maintain the same operational force size, we will&nbsp;need to extend the NS period, or the requirement for the standing force must have changed.&nbsp; There are no two ways about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his statement earlier, the Minister touched upon manpower productivity measures where MINDEF&nbsp;has somehow found a way to work with fewer National Servicemen.&nbsp; As they&nbsp;look down the road 10 years from now, they must have prepared for the day when the number of our National Servicemen will be even&nbsp;much smaller.&nbsp; The Minister has already painted the future of the 3-G SAF, where technical capabilities are becoming more crucial and indispensable in the defence of Singapore.&nbsp; Since war was first pursued, generals have always asked for more men and more weapons.&nbsp; The Chinese proverb <I>duo duo yi shan</I>, which means the more the merrier, was attributed to General Han Xing, who helped to establish the Han Dynasty.&nbsp; In recent times, one is reminded of the American generals in the conduct of the Iraqi war.&nbsp; It was at the insistence of the US Defence Secretary, Mr Donald Rumsfeld, that the US military already had sufficient forces at hand to pursue its campaign that the general reluctantly <p align=left>Column: 1814<p>went ahead.&nbsp; Otherwise, the military would have waited for more men and more equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF would have to live with a&nbsp;much smaller force a decade down the road.&nbsp; Sooner or later, we would have to adopt a different doctrine for a totally different war of the future and not, as the Minister said, wars of the past.&nbsp; Could we have taken advantage of our transformation into a 3-G SAF, thereby reducing the size</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, although National Service has been introduced for more than three decades, for a variety of reasons, females have never been enlisted.&nbsp; MINDEF's response has hitherto been that, based strictly on our current defence needs, there is no need to enlist women for NS.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, perhaps it is time to reconsider this policy for three reasons:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, women have an equal responsibility to men for the well-being of Singapore. Singapore belongs as much to the women as she does to the men.&nbsp; On the economic front, women already have equal access to education and to employment, whilst on the social and political fronts, there are no hindrances to participation and contribution.&nbsp; By the same token, women should not be excluded from National Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, National Service need not be limited to military service.&nbsp; Equally compelling possibilities are nursing and civil defence but not for the reasons that Mr Chiam&nbsp;has given, which appear to revolve around stereotype views. My point is about enlarging the whole concept of National Service, regardless of gender, and not to reinforce stereotype<p align=left>Column: 1815<p> views that nursing is only for women. Even for military vocations, there are women who are professionally employed currently.&nbsp; As the Minister has said, as technology and knowledge will be applied on an increasing scale, that is, more brains than brawns, the exclusion of women becomes less defensible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, currently, NSmen are recipients of preferential treatment in several ways.&nbsp; NSmen who join the public sector are afforded higher starting salaries.&nbsp; They are given tax reliefs and issued more distributions by Government, for example, the New Singapore Shares. They enjoy membership of SAFRA club facilities.&nbsp; But, most importantly, on an intangible scale, every male has a shared experience that facilitates bonding with one another.&nbsp; Overall, NS has helped foster ties and served as a leveller, and as a melting pot for our diverse cultures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a quick survey by the newsapaper, <I>Today</I>, some 45% of the women aged between 14 and 25 years polled said "yes" to NS.&nbsp; Although not all females are enthusiastic about being conscripted, as my two girls will readily tell you, we should bear in mind the bigger picture. The fact that only men are made to serve NS is a form of discrimination. The current policy of enlisting men only fails to recognise the equal role that women can play in the defence of our nation.&nbsp; It also denies them the privileges that their male counterparts are afforded by virtue thereof.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, DPM spoke of forging a strong society which must necessarily entail the contribution of all Singaporeans, both men and women. I do not deny that extending NS to women will increase defence and related spending as well as have potential ramifications for our labour supply. But change is what remaking Singapore is all<p align=left>Column: 1816<p> about, is it not?&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask the Minister for his reasons for not introducing NS to females.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, National Service has become a way of life in Singapore. Many of us, male citizens in Parliament, have undergone military or Police National Service since its inception in the 1960s.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the old days, military or Police National Service personnel had to do two or three years of NS, depending on the rank he held.&nbsp; It could be asked: how productive was he during these 2-3 years? &nbsp;What is the productivity level of National Servicemen undergoing 2½ years of NS today?&nbsp; Is there a need to serve that long?&nbsp; Could the Minister consider reducing National Service liability, in a few years' time, say, with effect from 2006 or 2007, to 1½ years instead of 2½ years, so that our young NSmen, while serving the nation, could go on to be more productive in studies and working life as soon as possible?&nbsp; A great deal of their training may be repetitive and unnecessary.&nbsp; Alternatively, NS could be served during university or polytechnic holiday periods.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been constantly discussed by our people and leaders whether National Service should be extended to females once they attain 18 years of age.&nbsp; Thus far, the Ministry has not favoured it. Should this be reviewed?&nbsp; Should it be considered on a voluntary basis or should it be compulsory plus voluntary basis, serving perhaps, for one year, and beyond that, on a voluntary basis of another half year if it is going to be 1½ years?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should they not be given a chance to serve the nation too like men, maybe not in a combat role except those who are really keen to do so? They could easily be assigned to do many jobs in the military or Police, including administrative, planning, medical, etc. Also, this will ensure that they keep fit and will learn and appreciate<p align=left>Column: 1817<p> what NS is all about and be loyal to the nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thorny issue that crops up often but seldom gets a full airing is the issue of Malays doing National Service.&nbsp; What is the ratio mix of NSmen in the SAF and Police National Service currently?&nbsp; Compared to our population of Chinese, Malays and Indians, what is the percentage of Malays in the military and the Police National Service?&nbsp; What is the percentage in the Army, Navy and Air Force?&nbsp; There is, for many years, the perception that Malays are not to be given sensitive positions in the military.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Is it because of the sensitive Malay-Muslim population in this region and because of Malaysia and Indonesia?&nbsp; Would our Malays be sitting on the fence if there is a conflict between Singapore and Malaysia or Indonesia?&nbsp; What if there is a conflict with India or China? Would the Indians or Chinese be sitting on the fence too?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should treat all citizens alike and the nation and its leaders must be confident of its citizens to be loyal.&nbsp; During confrontation in the early 1960s, the Malays defended Singapore against Indonesia, so did the Chinese and Indians.&nbsp; There should not be a mental discrimination against race in the Singapore Armed Forces or Police Force National Service.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, I fully agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua's call for Government to reconsider the issue of having our women serve in National Service.&nbsp; Apart from the very pertinent reasons that Mrs Lim has enunciated, there is also a very practical issue which I think we should consider.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While compulsory National Service for young men ensures that the Armed Forces will be adequately manned, there are many sectors as well in the country that have to be fully geared and operational in<p align=left>Column: 1818<p> the case of an impending war or&nbsp;other such national emergencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, not an insignificant percentage of the staffing in our hospitals are non-Singaporeans.&nbsp; In the case of an impending war, there is a significant probability that these workers may return to their homes, leaving our hospitals and other healthcare institutions very short-handed, particularly in a situation where the men with National Service obligations will also have been called up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect that this may similarly be the situation in other equally important sectors, besides healthcare.&nbsp; Therefore, I think this is a situation which should be addressed and we should therefore consider the introduction of National Service for Singaporean women.&nbsp; It is important, as Mrs Lim has said, that our women are allowed to serve as well as our menfolk do in the defence of our country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides that, there are other reasons and benefits for the women and the nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, opportunities for women to be educated and sensitised to national issues which I think is currently quite a gap, as women transit from school to work and then considering a total involvement in family issues and, therefore, they do not have the same kind of exposure and opportunities as our young men do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, increase opportunities for them to foster understanding and bonding across racial and socio-economic classes through the mixing that is possible in the period of National Service.&nbsp; This concurrently enables them to widen their own network of friends and colleagues into the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, opportunities to pick up skills which will&nbsp;be useful throughout their lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1819<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, opportunities for young women with potential to be identified so that the development to optimise their contributions in future leaderhip roles can be facilitated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all of these in mind, I therefore trust the Minister will give this proposal some consideration.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Operationally Ready NSmen</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol</B>):&nbsp; Sir, the policy of having Operationally Ready NSmen has been the key pillar in our total defence policy in deterring any potential aggressors.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wholeheartedly support this policy.&nbsp; However, Sir, I would&nbsp;like to ask the Minister&nbsp;for Defence if there is room for some flexibility to accommodate our intended shift to an entrepreneurial economy,&nbsp;without sacrificing the effectiveness of our reservist policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A start-up entrepreneur does not&nbsp;have it easy if he has to attend to the call of reservist duty for several weeks&nbsp;a year.&nbsp; A start-up&nbsp;entrepreneur puts in much longer hours than the average working people and his absence from work will have a significant impact&nbsp;in his budding business.&nbsp; Is there room to review the duration of reservist duty?

Members of Parliament.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am not talking here about just making babies.&nbsp; I think we should leave making babies as a national service, it is not a national duty in the first place.&nbsp; As to why I see it as a nation building exercise is because I see that there are two arms to National Service.&nbsp; One part of it is that there are other sectors as mentioned before - the SCDF, Singapore Red Cross, the Police, the health sector - that also do their own little bit in building up this nation. And then, we have the military arm.&nbsp; If we were to put these two arms together under a bigger corporate whole, maybe consider it as a nation building exercise, then within this realm, both men and women can play a more productive role. In that context then, I would like to hope that both men and women can be given an opportunity to choose which arm of these sectors they would like to compulsorily give their service to.&nbsp; And in time, perhaps a year's stint, and if they wish to specialise, they can sign up for a longer training period or be enlisted into the military arm or the other arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are interesting models already around, from Switzerland to now I hear that Sweden too is going to table this in Parliament for discussion.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the need for women to be conscripted into nation building, this is inevitable on two counts.&nbsp; If women wish to see gender equity as something that is due to them, then it is also fair that women see this as part of their duty towards the nation to serve in the military or to serve in any one of these sectors. Secondly, women coming into this fold&nbsp;are also equally important as human resources are getting scarce and it will become inevitable that women need to play a bigger role in this area of nation <p align=left>Column: 1821<p>building. In fact, the then Prime Minister had already brought this up in 1978 and this was brought up again in 1998 when Parliament discussed this issue all over again.&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some women, of course, might find this unpalatable. Why should they be serving in such an exercise?&nbsp; However, I think it is&nbsp;a fair demand for women to do their bit in this.&nbsp; An&nbsp;AWARE's position, which was tabled to the Remaking Singapore Committee, is that it is something we ought to do as women if we are asking for gender equity.&nbsp; Women need to know also that doing such a stint is beneficial as it prepares them for national emergencies, something that Dr Jennifer Lee has already said, and the throwing together of people from diverse backgrounds is both an enriching and challenging exercise.</P></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Measures included the extension of passport validity and the waiver of monetary bonds for NS-liable males who accompany their parents on overseas employment.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Initiatives to keep up with educational trends such as (i) recognising NS for admission to Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs); (ii) calling NSmen for training during specific periods of the IHL vacation window to minimise disruption to their studies; (iii) providing e-learning courses to facilitate the transition of full-time national servicemen into further studies or the workforce.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Enhancing recreational facilities for NSmen, such as the new golf course in Kranji.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Harnessing information technology to enhance NS management and administration, such as automating the recall/mobilisation system and allowing online updating of NSmen's personal records.&nbsp; The pay processes have been enhanced to make NS Pay administration more convenient for NSmen.&nbsp; NSmen can now submit their Make Up Pay Claims online.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to inform this House that most RECORD III recommendations have been implemented with the remaining few slated for completion by the end of this year.&nbsp; I have circulated to Members a table showing the key recommendations and their status.&nbsp; But I would like to highlight three of these that were completed in 2003:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Servicemen who hold leadership positions (ie, officers and specialists) and who have demonstrated outstanding performance during full-time NS are eligible for Co-Curricular Activities points for NS. These count towards the bonus points for admission to NUS and NTU.</p><p align=left>Column: 1824<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; An e-learning facility was set up for full-time national servicemen who wish to take up on-line courses during service to facilitate their transition to further studies or the workforce.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; NSmen can now update their personal records online via MIW.com.sg.&nbsp; This is one of the several e-initiatives introduced as part of the RECORD III recommendations.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong has also raised his concern on the award of NS points for university admission. &nbsp;Under the NUS and NTU admission system, students are awarded points for participation in CCA, in junior colleges, centralised institutes and the polytechnics. &nbsp;These can constitute up to 5% of the total score for admission into these universities.&nbsp; Like CCA, National Service also cultivates qualities such as leadership and teamwork, which contribute to the development of a well-rounded person.&nbsp; One of RECORD III's recommendations was to award additional CCA points for NS to help national servicemen in their application to NUS or NTU. MINDEF has worked with both universities to establish this system.&nbsp; The additional points for NS are awarded based on NS performance, and level of responsibility held. &nbsp;This system was implemented as of the last admission exercise in 2003. For that exercise, out of 1,081 NUS and NTU applicants who were eligible for the scheme, 570 (53%) were awarded additional CCA points.&nbsp; MINDEF will review the outcome of the implementation of the recommendations in RECORD III and consider when to convene RECORD IV.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Arthur Fong commented that NS allowance is inadequate in the context of the high cost of living in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. &nbsp;He suggested a market allowance that is commensurate with NSFs' "A" levels and polytechnic diploma qualifications.&nbsp; Sir, National Service (NS) is a duty performed by male Singaporeans and Permanent<p align=left>Column: 1825<p> Residents upon reaching the age of 18 years, to safeguard <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s security and sovereignty.&nbsp; It is not a form of employment where remuneration is pegged to market rates.&nbsp; Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs) receive an allowance that is meant to help cover basic upkeep, such as transport and incidentals. &nbsp;Lodging, food, clothing and medical care are provided for by the SAF as most of them stay in camps.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF recognises the sacrifices and contributions of our National Servicemen.&nbsp; We regularly conduct reviews of NS allowances, taking into account inflation in the cost of living and the level of responsibilities shouldered by them. &nbsp;The last revision was made less than two years ago in July 2002, when NS allowances across all ranks were increased significantly by about 50%.&nbsp; A recruit's monthly allowance was raised from $240 to $350. A combat specialist holding the rank of Third Sergeant had his monthly allowance increased from $420 to $660, while a Lieutenant had his monthly allowance increased from $780 to $1,150.&nbsp; Over a two to 2½ years' period, Full-time National Servicemen will receive progressively higher allowances from $350 to $1,150 per month, depending on the rank attained. &nbsp;Since the last increase in NS allowances in 2002, the CPI, last year (2003), was only 0.5%.&nbsp; MINDEF will continue to track the inflation rates and will review NS allowances from time to time.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Chiam See Tong thought it a good idea to introduce compulsory National Service for women and he suggested that three months be put aside for basic military training and nine months to train them as nurses.&nbsp; This, he said, will equip them to be better homemakers, more able to cope with emergency situations, with people and with children.&nbsp; But, Sir, nursing is an elaborate course.&nbsp; Nanyang Polytechnic, for example, runs such a nursing course and it takes three <p align=left>Column: 1826<p>years full-time to train a competent nurse.&nbsp; Dr Jennifer Lee also supported National Service for women, but for a different reason, so that they may help out in the healthcare sector, especially in times of emergency.&nbsp; Mrs Lim Hwee Hua believed that NS should be a shared responsibility between males and females, and nation building should be applied to both.&nbsp; She also mentioned nursing or civil defence.&nbsp; Ms Braema suggested that women be offered the option of volunteering for NS.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am heartened to hear so many Members speaking up in support of National Service, and for women to get involved in NS, should the need arise.&nbsp; This is an acknowledgement of the importance of NS to the security of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The primary purpose of NS is to ensure that we have the operational capability to defend <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Compulsory NS for male citizens was introduced in 1967 as we could not afford to rely solely on a regular Army to build a credible defence force for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The reason is obvious.&nbsp; Our population is too small.&nbsp; Today, National Servicemen form the bulk of our defence force.&nbsp; NS continues to be vital to the defence and security of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; But the Government's decision on compulsory NS for male citizens was taken only after very careful and very serious considerations. It was not taken lightly.&nbsp; It recognised that the purpose to compel a person to serve must be of critical importance.&nbsp; It decided that the defence of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is indeed a purpose of critical importance.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been suggestions that NS for women can be the solution to the shortage of SAF manpower caused by the falling birth rate.&nbsp; But the dwindling cohort of NS resource is not new to the SAF, as the Minister has pointed out, and it is true that our pool of national servicemen will continue to reduce in the long term.&nbsp; Nevertheless, MINDEF will have the ability to maintain operational readiness effectively by leveraging on technological <p align=left>Column: 1827<p>advancements, commercialisation of support functions and higher productivity.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no need for MINDEF to enlist women for NS compulsorily to meet SAF's operational requirements at this point.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members spoke about the value of NS and how it contributes to social cohesion and nation building.&nbsp; This is well-taken and is, indeed, a good and desirable outcome of NS.&nbsp; However, the primary purpose of NS is to defend <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, as I have explained earlier.&nbsp; We have to examine whether the objectives of social cohesion and nation building can best be met by means other than compulsory NS for women. &nbsp;Calling up women for NS would take them temporarily out of the workforce and result in significant cost to both the nation and our women.&nbsp; It is a decision that should not be taken lightly as the purpose of building social cohesion is not of the same order of critical importance as the defence of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we are to introduce NS for women, the SAF can deploy some women for operational duties, as pointed out by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, since we have a group of regular servicemen who are women and they perform operational roles. However, at this time, the SAF does not have a need and would not be able to place all our women (about 15,000 of them per cohort) in operational positions.&nbsp; So if we were just to choose some of them, then it will breach the principle of universality of NS.&nbsp; Who do we choose?&nbsp; How do we ensure equitability?&nbsp; These are all relevant questions.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Braema and Mr Chandra Mohan have suggested that women volunteer for NS.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform them that many women currently volunteer their services to the SAF.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>Most of them serve as nurses in Combat Support Hospitals (CSHs). They perform various important duties in the Combat Operating Theatre,<p align=left>Column: 1828<p> High Dependency Care and Treatment Sections. In addition, there are about 6,000 active Civil Defence volunteers, out of whom about 2,000 are women. They play an important role during civil emergencies like CPR, first aid, shelter management and administration of blood donation drives.&nbsp; These are some of the functions mentioned by Dr Jennifer Lee.&nbsp; However, these are volunteer services rather than compulsory service.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam alluded to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s NS system whereby they also enlist women for a short period, and wondered why it is not the case for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; As Members are aware, the 12-week National Service Programme which was introduced recently in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region> is different.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is aimed at nation-building and fostering a stronger sense of patriotism, cohesion and unity amongst Malaysian youths.&nbsp; Most of these objectives and others, such as racial integration, national education and community service, are already largely addressed in our school system in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The Malaysian NS programme does not encompass military training.&nbsp; It is different from NS in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, due in part to the different social circumstances of our two countries.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, MINDEF currently has no plans to extend compulsory NS to women.&nbsp; However, the Government will revisit this issue from time to time to weigh if there are strong arguments for extending NS to women.&nbsp; The SAF will continue to welcome woman volunteers whenever there is a need.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><I>Role of National Service in Nation-Building</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nation building is a continuous process, involving every Singaporean in every sector of society, whether it is at the workplace, in school, in the sports field, or at home.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Service is one key institution which contributes to nation building.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1829<p> Singaporean males of all strata of society train shoulder to shoulder to fight as a team. &nbsp;Their common experience in NS helps bond them, and shape the Singaporean identity and character.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members have also raised the point about women wanting to contribute to nation building.&nbsp; Let me say that our women are already contributing to nation building and total defence in many ways. &nbsp;As our men, and some SAF regular women as well, participate in military defence, our women contribute to economic defence by their participation in the workforce. &nbsp;Women are also critical pillars in support of civil, psychological and social defence.&nbsp; Many of our woman employers&nbsp; -&nbsp; Dr Jennifer Lee included&nbsp; -&nbsp; support our men employees when they are called up for&nbsp; In-Camp Training.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recognition of such support, spouses of NSmen are entitled to a tax relief of $500 effective from the year of assessment 1997, which has since been increased to $750 effective from the year of assessment 2003.&nbsp; The Government does recognise the contributions of women to nation building in wide and varied ways.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Wang Kai Yuen spoke about the challenges facing the SAF in view of the declining birth rate.&nbsp; The declining fertility rate and smaller NS resource pool is not a new problem for MINDEF.&nbsp; In the 1970s, the average size of the NS cohort was 22,000. In the mid-90s, the male cohort size shrunk to about 15,000. MINDEF has been tackling the decline in NS resource pool for some time now and if our TFR remains low, we would have to do more. Over the years, through the greater use of technology and the commercialisation of our logistics and support functions, MINDEF has been able to make do with the smaller resource pool without compromising operational readiness.&nbsp; Workflow and procedures are also constantly reviewed and streamlined to<p align=left>Column: 1830<p> ensure that manpower usage is optimised.&nbsp; These measures have helped us to free our scarce manpower resources for combat jobs.&nbsp; The SAF is also reviewing its long-term force structure to meet operational and training requirements with a reduced NS resource.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me briefly mention some of these measures.&nbsp; Firstly, commercialisation of support services.&nbsp; Wherever possible, we have commercialised non-combat support services.&nbsp; The Minister mentioned about the ST Aerospace crew which has accompanied our C-130 aircraft in its deployment to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Any activity that is not critical for field operation, we will contract it out to the private sector so as to free our National Servicemen for the more important and critical combat jobs. For example, we have commercialised the SAF cookhouse about six years ago to very good effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; SAF camps now serve food of a higher quality and at competitive prices.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, manpower productivity and technology development.&nbsp; This has been covered in some detail by Minister Teo Chee Hean.&nbsp; To maintain operational readiness with minimum manpower, we have invested in better training techniques, like simulators, to reduce the need for manpower and to increase their effectiveness.&nbsp; The Primus, as mentioned by Minister Teo, is a good example of higher productivity, where what used to be operated by 12 soldiers is now operated by only four, a multi-fold increase in productivity.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, progressive training.&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to have one form of Basic Military Training (BMT).&nbsp; However, over the years, we have revamped it to minimise the attrition due to training injuries.&nbsp; BMT is the crucial period, since a certain acclimatisation period is required to transform a civilian into a soldier.&nbsp; Most recruits would not have been exposed to <p align=left>Column: 1831<p>the intensity of physical activity prior to NS.&nbsp; We need to build them up progressively so that attrition as a result of physical injuries is minimised.&nbsp; This translates to a higher retention of combat-fit soldiers who can be deployed in combat vocations post-BMT.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, refining the medical classification system.&nbsp; The PES grading system used by MINDEF is reviewed every three years by HQ Medical Corps and the Medical Classification Centre.&nbsp; The review ensures that the recommendations on fitness for military duties are consistent with latest medical knowledge and practice.&nbsp; It also takes into account improvements in medical treatment that allows servicemen with certain medical conditions to be safely deployed in combat vocations.&nbsp; This has allowed us to maintain a relatively steady stream of combat fit servicemen for deployment in the SAF.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these various measures, I am pleased to inform Members that the SAF is coping well with the reduced NS resources.&nbsp; Our operational readiness has been maintained.&nbsp; Dr Wang mentioned about transformation and 3G SAF.&nbsp; Although we have made much achievement in this regard, transformation does take time.&nbsp; Our operational readiness and standing force effectiveness, however, has been maintained.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan asked whether 2-2½ years of NS is too long.&nbsp; This is also a question posed by Mr Arthur Fong.&nbsp; Mr Chandra Mohan also questioned about the racial mix in the SAF.&nbsp; Let me address these questions.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;National Service plays a vital role in safeguarding the security and sovereignty of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; It is important that National Servicemen are well trained, proficient and operationally ready.&nbsp; The length of<p align=left>Column: 1832<p> National Service is determined by the time required to train our National Servicemen to the required level of military proficiency, especially for military commanders, warrant officers and specialists.&nbsp; They are trained not only to handle their own personal equipment, but also to be able to fight effectively as an integrated force.&nbsp; Our National Servicemen have to operate at the battalion, brigade and up to the division levels.&nbsp; As many Members have pointed out, MINDEF has increasingly used technology.&nbsp; While the use of technology and sophisticated weapons systems has given us a decisive capability edge, soldiers still require a significant period of training and familiarisation to operate these advanced weapons systems proficiently.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF would not want National Servicemen to spend more time than necessary for NS duties because we are acutely aware of the commitment and sacrifices that they have to make.&nbsp; For this reason, MINDEF has a scheme whereby physically fit enlistees who attain at least a Silver standard in the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test do not have to undergo the physical training phase before Basic Military Training, and have their National Service duration reduced by two months.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><I>Racial Mix and Officer Selection in the SAF</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now turn to the subject of racial mix in the SAF, a topic raised by Mr Chandra Mohan.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full-time National Servicemen are deployed to the SAF, Singapore Police Force (SPF) or the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), which are all part of our Total Defence system.&nbsp; National Servicemen contribute to the security of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, regardless of the uniformed service in which they are serving.&nbsp; The allocation of National Servicemen to these different uniformed services is based on<p align=left>Column: 1833<p> various factors, such as educational qualifications, physical attributes and vocational aptitudes, amongst others.&nbsp; Taking our Total Defence system as a whole, the ethnic composition of National Servicemen corresponds to the ethnic profile of our population.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Defence Minister has explained that the SAF now has an expanded role and has to accomplish these roles with a dwindling pool of available manpower.&nbsp; Therefore, the SAF intends to make the most use of all available manpower.&nbsp; To this end, the SAF, like all sectors in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> society, works on the principle of meritocracy.&nbsp; This means that so long as a person is committed to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, dedicated to the SAF and is capable of doing the job, his appointment and advancement in the SAF will be based on performance and merit, regardless of his race or his religion.&nbsp; Selection for Officer Cadet Training is a good case in point where meritocracy is applied.&nbsp; Out of the pool of eligible Malay candidates, which comprises those with 'A' levels or Polytechnic diplomas, the percentage selected to attend Officer Cadet School (OCS) is comparable to that of non-Malay candidates.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF is committed to ensuring that our limited manpower resource is optimally deployed to ensure the defence and security of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

MINDEF and the SAF are mindful that NSmen face competing demands of NS duties, family and work.&nbsp; Hence, NSmen are called up for no longer than the period required to meet the training objectives.&nbsp; While NSmen can be called up for a maximum of 40 days of NS in a work year, in practice, an NSman is generally called up for not more than 14 days for local training, or 21 days for<p align=left>Column: 1834<p> overseas training, in his high-key training year.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of SAF's continuous effort to enhance training effectiveness and administrative efficiency, the National Service Training System (NSTS) was recently reviewed.&nbsp; What used to be a 13-year system with nine high-key years and four low-key years has been reviewed.&nbsp; By capitalising on our extensive investment in training technology, the new system aims to maintain the operational readiness of our NS units, while at the same time provide more meaningful, focused and effective training by optimising the time commitment of our NSmen during In-Camp Training (ICT).&nbsp; The concept of this new system includes two phases, namely, the first 10 years ICT period and the next 3-year of BIT (Basic Individual Training) period.&nbsp; Under this system, NSmen will serve at least seven high-key ICT, compared to the nine previously, out of a total period of 13 years, which remains unchanged.&nbsp; But in the last three years, they are called up for just two days each for BIT to refresh them on their basic soldiering skills.&nbsp; This, in effect, represents a reduction of operationally-ready NSmen ICT training. MINDEF has also restricted the number of times an NSman can be called up for NS duties to a maximum of three times per work year.&nbsp; Also, we have strived and done our best to ensure that notices are provided at least six months in advance of the training commencement date.</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Priority will be given to NSmen who have a good ICT attendance and<p align=left>Column: 1835<p> performance record.&nbsp; In addition, commanders are given the flexibility to grant time-off of up to two days for NSmen to attend to urgent business matters which may crop up from time to time during their NS training stint.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like now to address the issues of accounting practices and irregular claims, as raised by Dr Maliki and Dr Ong Chit Chung.&nbsp; Sir, let me first thank both Dr Ong and Dr Maliki for their concerns regarding the findings of the Auditor-General's Office and the Public Accounts Committee on MINDEF.&nbsp; Their concerns are understandable and MINDEF will continue to improve upon our financial control systems.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I address the background of the specific irregularities, I would like to seek Members' understanding that, for a large organisation, like MINDEF, to function efficiently, a certain amount of decentrali<p align=left>Column: 1836<p>sation, delegation and empowerment is essential and in fact desirable.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, even though MINDEF spares no efforts in strengthening its financial controls to minimise systemic weaknesses, human lapses or non-systemic problems sometimes occur.&nbsp; I shall take the Members through the irregularities which occurred in MINDEF over the last four years, as raised by Dr Ong and Dr Maliki.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, each time an irregularity was noted, its causes were investigated and measures were taken to address any system flaws to prevent the lapses from recurring.&nbsp; Most of these cases reported were due to human lapses and non-systemic problems.&nbsp; To deter and prevent such problems from recurring, MINDEF has sent a strong signal to its personnel that it will not hesitate to take disciplinary actions against any one found guilty of deliberately circumventing controls for personal gains.&nbsp; In cases where personnel were found to be negligent, disciplinary actions commensurate with the gravity of the case, were also meted out against them.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the audit of the claims system, the Auditor-General reported seven cases of intentional splitting of claims, 21 cases of duplicate claims and 83 cases of claims made for visits to Chinese physicians, which should not have been allowed.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the PAC@Gov used by the rest of the civil service, the Personal Claims System in MINDEF is an honour-based claim system.&nbsp; The system relies on the honesty and integrity of individual servicemen to submit only legitimate claims.&nbsp; Claimants are personally accountable for the claims made.&nbsp; They are subject to severe disciplinary actions if they breach the trust of the system.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seven cases of spilt claims amounted to about $995, which is about 0.1% of the $1 million of claims paid out in that fiscal year.&nbsp; Though the amount <p align=left>Column: 1837<p>involved may not be significant, MINDEF takes a serious view of these cases of breach of faith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Full investigations were conducted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Claimants found to have intentionally split the claims were summarily dealt with or court-martialled.&nbsp; Many were fined depending on the gravity of the offences.&nbsp; One was fined $500 and sentenced to 10 days' detention.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty-one&nbsp;cases of duplicate claims were investigated.&nbsp; It was concluded that there was no intent to cheat.&nbsp; All were isolated instances of claimants being careless in their filing or arose out of unfamiliarity with the procedure of making amendments to the legitimate claims resulting in duplicate entries.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For the 83 cases of claims made for visits to Chinese physicians, investigations revealed that the personnel had thought that such claims were allowed since Chinese physicians were registered with the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Practitioners Board.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF has recovered all the wrongful claims.&nbsp; Claimants and the Approving Officers have been cautioned to be more vigilant in the filing and processing of claims.&nbsp; Depending on the degree of negligence, the claimants were either given Record of Verbal Warnings or verbally reprimanded.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF has also issued an advisory to all servicemen on the proper submission of claims and has reiterated that it will take severe disciplinary action against any personnel found guilty of cheating.&nbsp; Checklists for Approving Officers as well as a list of common mistakes committed in the Personal Claims System have also been promulgated.&nbsp; In addition, the system has also been enhanced so that claimants may select only from a list of clinics registered with the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; The system has also been upgraded to identify duplicate and split claims and will prompt the Approving Officers to verify <p align=left>Column: 1838<p>the original receipts to detect likely duplicate or split claims.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

This case was discovered in 2002, that an officer at an overseas detachment had omitted to submit his leave records and had over-claimed about $1,500 in subsistence allowances.&nbsp; The investigation established that the over-claim of subsistence allowances was due to the misinterpretation of guidelines by the processing staff.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the over-consumption of leave, the investigation established that the officer's action of not submitting the leave records was unintentional.&nbsp; It was attributed to the heightened training activities that the officer was involved with as well as the immense stress that he had due to domestic family matters.&nbsp; All over-claimed subsistence allowances and over-consumption of leave have been recovered from the officer.&nbsp; He was also given a Letter of Warning for the lapses.&nbsp; This Letter of Warning has an adverse impact on his next promotion for the next three years.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

The Mess Manager was consequently dismissed and the amount was fully recovered.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF, having carried out the investigation, is satisfied that there were no systemic problems in this case.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the last case, for the over-crediting of over $600,000 to the retirement accounts of servicemen, I acknowledge the oversight of my officials.&nbsp; However, I assure the Members that the lapses did not result in any loss of public money.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 475 Premium Members' accounts that were over-credited, none of the cases were due for payment yet.&nbsp; To administer the Premium Scheme for the Warrant Officers, Specialists and Enlistees, the Premium Administration System was developed.&nbsp; As in all other MINDEF systems, a User Acceptance Test was conducted and this was one of the procedures for IT system development before the system was rolled out, so as to ensure that the system is functioning correctly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, one system check was missed out and overlooked.&nbsp; The errors have since been rectified and the system check put in place.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF recognised that some of the lapses were the result of inadequate training in financial procedures.&nbsp; Since 2002, we have introduced a policy where staff must be trained and certified in the necessary procedures before they can be given financial appointments. They are also provided with the opportunity to undergo refresher courses as and when needed.&nbsp; This process of training and certification enables the vast majority of financial appointment holders to conduct their responsibilities properly and with the full knowledge of the relevant policies and procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp; When human error occurred,<p align=left>Column: 1840<p> these were caught, in large part, by the stringent controls that MINDEF has put in place.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to assure Members that MINDEF has in place a basically sound financial control system with proper segregation of duties, a staff rotation policy and an EDP cum audit checks.&nbsp; MINDEF has and will continue to learn from these lapses and to improve upon our internal controls to minimise systemic weaknesses.&nbsp; We will continue to simplify and clarify financial guidelines, and take various measures to further enhance our system.&nbsp; Our adoption of the Risk and Internal Controls Evaluation (RICE) which is also a Control Self Assessment system is a step in this direction.&nbsp; It is an approach which is increasingly considered an Internal Audit Best Practice.&nbsp; It requires staff to assess for themselves the risks and adequacy of financial controls of the business processes they are responsible for.&nbsp; And such self assessments are conducted with the assistance of the Internal Audit Department.&nbsp; Such a system transforms the traditional role of the Auditor from that of an unwelcomed inspector to one in which the Auditor is a partner to help correct weaknesses before lapses even occur.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

For example, Sir, the Ministry of Education requires all schools to run a Trim-and-Fit Programme for students from the primary to pre-university levels to reduce the percentage of overweight students and improve their overall physical fitness.&nbsp; And MINDEF provides support for this programme by providing schools the MINDEF Physical Fitness Performance Awards to encourage schools to improve levels of physical fitness among their students.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Health also contributes to the fitness programme through the Health Promotion Board.&nbsp; What does it do?&nbsp; It provides medical screening and nutrition counselling for the severely overweight students and develops the norms used in schools to identify overweight students.&nbsp; The principals and teachers are encouraged to give attention and priority <p align=left>Column: 1843<p>to these programmes.&nbsp; MINDEF meets the principals of the various educational institutions regularly to brief them and to let them know the general trends in the fitness levels of the new enlistees, and specifically on how the individual educational institutions have performed relative to each other in terms of the percentage of students that have taken and passed the National Physical Fitness Award.&nbsp;

Prof. Low Seow Chay</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I am going to talk about air pollution derived from diesel-driven vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, diesel engine driven trucks, taxis and buses are more energey efficient than similar vehicles powered by petrol engines.&nbsp;The diesel-driven vehicles running on Singapore roads help our nation in saving millions of dollars, in terms of the import of fuel every year.&nbsp; This is because diesel engines burn less quantity of fuel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trouble with diesel vehicles is the particulate matter in its emission, in particular, the particulate matter, PM 2.5, <p align=left>Column: 1852<p>which is classified as a carcinogen.&nbsp; It is a particulate which is smaller than 2.5 micron.&nbsp; In the current vehicle emission standards, there is no control of such matter.&nbsp; Ideally, this PM 2.5 could be easily removed by a particulate trap.&nbsp; In my view, we should push for a higher standard to protect our people against such&nbsp;a carcinogen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By implementing such a new requirement, it means&nbsp;an increase in the cost of vehicles and&nbsp;also an increase in transportation cost in doing business in Singapore.&nbsp; One of the ways to strike a good balance between the cost of transportation and a good clean environment is to push for a higher standard but exempt the taxes on anti-pollution and energy efficient equipment on the vehicles. We would not only want to achieve a world-class economic standard, we also aim to achieve world-class air quality standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Government to increase the vehicle emission standards and exempt the tax on all the anti-pollution equipment to make Singapore a cleaner place and that the cost of transportation even more affordable.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Diesel&nbsp;Engines</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Ong Kian Min (Tampines</B>):&nbsp; I share Prof. Low's concerns. Except for taxis and goods vehicles, we rarely, if ever, see diesel-powered passenger cars on our roads today.&nbsp; By contrast, in Europe, diesel vehicles, from trucks to vans to motorcars, are a common sight.&nbsp; Diesel-powered cars are fast gaining popularity in western Europe, although the strictest envrionmental conditions are imposed.&nbsp; Many top-tier car manufacturers, including BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz offer diesel counterparts to their petrol-powered cars.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that in recent years, such technological advances have been made with the refinement of diesel engines and <p align=left>Column: 1853<p>in the quality of the fuel itself that it warrants a serious relook at diesel as an alternative to petroleum.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One major advance in diesel engine design is that the injection of the fuel directly into the cylinders has produced engines that offer demonstrable exhaust emissions and fuel economy gains as well as substantial noise and vibration improvements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been told that aside from the price of diesel being lower than petrol by volume, diesel engines can deliver on the average up to 30% better fuel economy than their petroleum counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp;With less fuel being consumed, there is also lower carbon dioxide emission.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2001, vehicles registered for use in Singapore have had to comply with Euro 2 emission standards. This and our stringent regulations on the proper maintenance of vehicles in Singapore have resulted in a reduction in smoke emission from diesel-powered vehicles.&nbsp; In the year 2002, the Ministry of the Environment indicated that it would look into introducing Euro 3 emission standards at the appropriate time.&nbsp; However, in the region, Hong Kong and Thailand are already one step ahead, complying with the Euro 3 emission standards today.&nbsp; Next year, the European Union will adopt Euro 4 emission standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if it is possible for Singapore to leap-frog to&nbsp;Euro 4&nbsp;standards and, if so, when.&nbsp; Under the Euro 4 emission standards, diesel will have sulphur level of not more than 50 parts per million as compared to&nbsp;Euro 2 standards of 500 parts per million.&nbsp; Euro 4 standards will therefore reduce drastically the level of sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions from diesel-powered vehicles.&nbsp; Adoption of the&nbsp;Euro 4&nbsp;standards for diesel, coupled with the use of particulate<p align=left>Column: 1854<p> filters and stricter standards of vehicle maintenance, will make the case for diesel much stronger than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A comparison of the cost of petrol and the cost of diesel, not taking into account the excise duties, clearly shows that diesel is significantly cheaper than petrol.&nbsp; This being the case, switching to diesel can translate to significantly lower foreign exchange payments for national fuel imports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, car owners in Singapore face a major obstacle if they wish to purchase a diesel-powered car.&nbsp; In addition to road tax, diesel cars, other than taxis, are levied a prohibitive diesel tax of six times the road tax of an equivalent petrol-driven car.&nbsp; For taxis, the diesel tax is $4,700 per year.&nbsp; Such a high tax deters ownership of a diesel car in spite of the economy offered.&nbsp; I believe the reasons for the high diesel tax are two-fold.&nbsp; One, to contain smoke emissions, which will be significantly improved with the adoption of Euro 4 standards and high vehicle maintenance standards that we have.&nbsp; Two, as diesel does not attract any duty, unlike petrol, to equalise the operating cost of the car.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand from my discussions with the other Government agencies that the second point is not so much a problem as taxes and duties can be adjusted and fine-tuned. The main concern is in relation to pollution.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry can bring forward the adoption of&nbsp; Euro 4 standards,&nbsp;and with that, make changes to the tax and duty structure to allow vehicle owners a more balanced choice between petrol and diesel-powered cars.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, I would like to continue from what Prof. Low Seow Chay and Mr Ong Kian Min have said about diesel engine vehicles, in particular, diesel engine cars.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1855<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the report of the Office of Transportation Technologies, US Department of Energy, it was stated that modern diesel engine produces a lower amount of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons.

There was no unhealthy day, not a single day.&nbsp; One obvious reason is that we were not affected much by the regional haze last year.&nbsp; It was just modest.&nbsp; But, Sir, I want to emphasise the point that while regional haze is an important factor, we should not overstate that factor.&nbsp; The fact is that the quality of the air in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> depends a lot on what we do in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last 20 years, through careful planning and pollution control, we reduced the amount of lead in the air by more than 90%, and this did not happen by chance.&nbsp; At the same time, we reduced the amount of sulphur dioxide by more than 70%.&nbsp; Again, this did not happen by chance.&nbsp; Sir, the point I want to make here is that, as long as we work together to manage air pollution, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> can indeed continue to enjoy quality air for some time to come.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Iswaran and Dr Amy Khor asked if there is a difference between the air quality in the western area versus eastern area.&nbsp; Mr Iswaran said that the PSI is an average across <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Sir, I want to clarify that this is not the case.&nbsp; The way we measure PSI in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is that we have 14 stations spread all over <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and we take the worst reading of these 14 stations in the compilation of our PSI.&nbsp; In other words, when I say that last year we had 93% of good PSI days and 7% of moderate PSI days, that applies to the whole of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, whether you live in the west, east, north or south, since the compilation of PSI is based on worst reading across <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Therefore, I want to assure Dr Amy Khor and Mr Iswaran that the air in the west is clean, fresh and safe.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1859<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mdm Cynthia Phua asked for an update on the haze agreement.&nbsp; I am happy to report that the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution was ratified by six countries as of 25th November last year.&nbsp; What this means is that the Haze Agreement can now come into force under the ASEAN framework because we need to have six countries to ratify the agreement.&nbsp; We can now go ahead to consolidate and strengthen our regional collaboration in the areas of prevention, monitoring, and mitigation of land and forest fires.&nbsp; Sir, the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional Haze Agreement will take place on 28th and 29th of April in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and ASEAN members will discuss the implementation mechanism and decide on the location of the ASEAN Coordinating Centre which will harness, mobilise and coordinate existing resources. Hopefully, by working together as one region, we can minimise the potential impact of haze on ASEAN.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second indicator is the colour of the land, and again I am happy to say that it is still green and clean.&nbsp; Every day, 6,900 tons of wastes were collected in a very timely manner.&nbsp; 90% of this waste is incinerated in our incineration plants, with the remaining 10%, which are non-incinerable, disposed directly at Pulau Semakau as landfill.&nbsp; The number of illegal dumping has also come down, from 160 in year 2000 to 32 last year.&nbsp; But, Sir, one point worth noting is that every day, here in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we still need to deploy 6,700 cleaning workers, coming from town councils, NEA and NParks.&nbsp; They have to clean our streets, housing estates, parks, public amenities and public places. &nbsp; One of the reasons why <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is clean today is not because we are litter-free, but rather because every day we have these 6,700 workers to keep cleaning away our litter.&nbsp; I think this is something Singaporeans ought to reflect on.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1860<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third indicator is the colour of the water.&nbsp; Again, I am happy to say that it is still clear and safe.&nbsp; Every day, the PUB supplies 300 million gallons of water and every drop of used water is being treated to international standard before it is discharged to the sea.&nbsp; The amount of "brown" water, ie, the "flooding situation", has also improved over the years.&nbsp; Sir, Mr Othman Haron asked about last week's flood.&nbsp; The total size of flood-prone areas in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, over the years, has continued to come down. Thirty years ago, there were 3,200 hectares of flood-prone areas in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, equivalent to 8-9 <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Sentosa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Islands</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.&nbsp; By the end of last year, it has come down to 158 hectares, which is less than half the size of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Sentosa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.&nbsp; These flood-prone areas are pockets of low-lying areas.&nbsp; Whenever there is a heavy rain coinciding with high tide, we will have minor floods from time to time.&nbsp; There were 10 in the year 2000, six in 2003.&nbsp; Last week, the floods that we had were not minor floods.&nbsp; In fact, they were fairly extensive.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 8th March, in the Bukit Timah and <st1:Street><st1:address>Thomson Road</st1:address></st1:Street> areas, the flood was about 0.3 metre deep, lasted less than one hour, but covered an area of 11 hectares.&nbsp; That is why I said it was a fairly extensive flood.&nbsp; Three days later, on 11th March, in the Paya Lebar and Katong areas, again, the flood was about 0.3 metre deep, less than one hour long, but again, the area covered was quite extensive, about five hectares.&nbsp; So I can understand why Mr Othman Haron is concerned about the flood that took place last week.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are basically two reasons.&nbsp; First, the intensity of the storm last week was so heavy that it happens, on the average, once in 10 years.&nbsp; Secondly, it happened at a time when the tide was exceptionally high, more than three metres.&nbsp; These two factors, coming together, caused a fairly extensive flood.&nbsp; Some of you may wonder that since we are able to reduce the flood-prone areas <p align=left>Column: 1861<p>from 8-9 Sentosas to less than half, why do we not remove the problem of flooding completely?</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me explain.&nbsp; Lorong Buangkok is a place off Yio Chu Kang.&nbsp; According to PUB, that place is flooded, on the average, three times in a year.&nbsp; One reason is that the area is just slightly above the high tide level.&nbsp; As a result, whenever there is a heavy downpour, the place would flood.&nbsp; I asked PUB if we can do something to alleviate the flood situation there.&nbsp; PUB said, yes, it can be done.&nbsp; With today's technology, they can always put in place a pump to pump out the rain water whenever it rains heavily.&nbsp; However, it will cost us $10 million to put in place a solution, and that $10 million will go to benefit 28 households living in that area.&nbsp; Sir, Members will agree with me that it is just not cost effective.&nbsp; It does not make sense for us to spend $10 million to solve the flood problem for 28 households.&nbsp; So I asked PUB if it means that that area will forever have to suffer from flood.&nbsp; PUB said that realistically the practical approach would be to use some sand and earth to raise the ground level when the area is due for redevelopment.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to assure the House that wherever cost effective, we do undertake projects to reduce flooding.&nbsp; Take, for example, the one that is on-going at the Alexandra and Lower Delta area. We have widened and deepened the canal, and the project will be completed by the end of this year.&nbsp; Last week, even though the rain was heavy and the tide was high, that area was not flooded.&nbsp; We are beginning to see the benefits of widening and deepening the canal there.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the other flood prone area is a cluster around the central district area.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in the Jalan Besar area - some of the shophouses and roads are often flooded during heavy downpours <p align=left>Column: 1862<p>and high tides. The older parts of the city - <st1:place>Chinatown</st1:place> is also flood prone. Boat Quay, <st1:Street><st1:address>Rochor Road</st1:address></st1:Street>, <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Farrer</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, and so on are areas that are below the high tide level.&nbsp; The remaining area would be the ones mentioned by Mr Othman Haron - Geylang, Paya Lebar, <st1:Street><st1:address>Sims Avenue</st1:address></st1:Street>, <st1:Street><st1:address>Marine Drive</st1:address></st1:Street>, and so on.&nbsp; These are parts of the Geylang river system.&nbsp; Sir, I am happy to inform the House that, by the time the proposed Marina Barrage is put in place by the year 2007, most of these flood problems would go away, or at least be reduced by a very large extent.&nbsp; Sir, as mentioned by Mr Othman Haron, over the last 20 years we have spent $1.5 billion to reduce the floor-prone areas to 158 hectares now.&nbsp; Over the next 3-4 years, we will continue this effort. We aim to reduce the flood-prone areas from 158 hectares to less than 100 hectares, which is about one-quarter the size of Sentosa by 2007.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Othman Haron asked what kind of measures we can put in place today to reduce and minimise the impact of flooding on the residents.&nbsp; Sir, there are a few measures taken by PUB.&nbsp; Firstly, working with the NEA, we provide information on high tide to the residents in advance because we are able to forecast ahead which are the days we are likely to see exceptional high tides.&nbsp; Because the information is provided to the residents a few months ahead, the residents may have forgotten about our advisory note when the time comes.&nbsp; So starting from next week, PUB will provide reminders three days ahead of the high tide.&nbsp; Hopefully, this would better remind the residents.&nbsp; At the same time, PUB is working with the seven CCCs to provide flood advisories to residents living in the affected areas.&nbsp; PUB is also working with the radio to issue radio alert to keep the public informed in a very timely manner.&nbsp; Last, but not least, for those who want to find out more, they can always contact the PUB call centre, starting from last week, for any latest flood updates.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1863<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="16" Minute="45">4.45 pm</st1:time></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the fourth indicator is the colour of public health.&nbsp; And, here I am happy to say that public health is still pink.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>Last year, we had two major challenges. First, the outbreak of SARS. I am happy to say that our public health infrastructure and overall response system were put to the test and it shows that we are functioning well.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Some Members may remember that there was a concern about whether SARS could spread through the sewer system. In the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we have water seals that will not only trap smell but also SARS. More importantly, the people responded in a very united manner. Hence from the public health angle, we did well.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second challenge last year was the outbreak of dengue in our region. Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries. According to the WHO, 50 million people are infected every year, and 22,000 people - most of them are children - die every year from dengue. So this is something not to be taken lightly.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are located in a region where dengue is endemic. We are affected by the outbreak of dengue over the last two years. The number of dengue cases in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> went up, from 2,300 in 2001 to 4,000 in 2002, to 4,800 last year. We are not spared from the dengue outbreak.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am happy to say that we managed to keep the dengue outbreak situation under control. As some Members intend to touch on this subject, I will respond later when we come to them.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin asked whether we have any disaster management plans in place to cope with public health outbreaks. The answer is yes. Firstly, PUB<p align=left>Column: 1864<p> and NEA both have quick response teams in place all the time. These quick response teams were put to the test in the SARS outbreak and I think they responded very well when activated.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we work very closely with the pest control contractors so that when needed, we are able to activate them to conduct search and destroy operations.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, most importantly, we network strongly with the grassroots organisations. In times of need, we will be able to mobilise the grassroots as well.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of food-borne disease outbreaks, again, we have the system in place. Should there be an outbreak, we will be able to close the food shops concerned, seize and destroy food items, clean and disinfect the food shops.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, based on these four indicators, I am happy to say that 2003 was a good year, as far as environmental performance is concerned.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo asked how sustainable is the good environmental performance. He also asked about the monitoring mechanism for 2012 and the progress of our 3P efforts. Sir, for a fast-moving, growing and open city like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, none of these environmental performance achievements happened by chance. They did not come easy but it can be done as long as we work together to avoid environmental disaster. To ensure that we can continue to enjoy good environmental performance over the long term, we have, firstly, put in place very clear targets for the next 10 years under the Singapore Green Plan 2012, as mentioned by Dr Teo, in eight areas.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we have put in place a mechanism to review these targets every three years. This is very important because of the changing environment. So <p align=left>Column: 1865<p>we make sure that our 10-year targets are up to date once every three years.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but not least, we have translated all these 3-year and 10-year targets into a series of action programmes. As of now, there are six action programme committees formed by the 3P partners, and they have formulated 155 action programmes for implementation over the next three years. This shows how serious we are in translating our targets on paper into real action on the ground.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, I want to emphasise that how far we can go and how fast we can move towards the Singapore Green Plan 2012 depends on one thing: not so much the target or strategy or action plan, but very much our ability to transform our 3P partnership into 3P ownership. Some Members may wonder what is the difference between 3P partnership and 3P ownership.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I discussed this with my colleagues at the ENV, NEA and PUB. &nbsp;I told them that when we talk about 3P partnership, it is like having three persons on the same ship. I said that as we move from 3P partnership to 3P ownership, we should now have three owners and not three partners on the same ship. In other words, there are three captains to steer and direct the ship.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response, my Senior Parliamentary Secretary Maidin said,&nbsp;"Mr Lim, I don't think so.&nbsp; From my limited knowledge about how a captain runs a ship, I don't think it is possible for three captains to direct one ship. I don't think that is a good illustration."</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CEO of PUB, Khoo Teng Chye, said, "Instead of ship, why don't we use Jumbo aircraft instead?"&nbsp; In a SIA Jumbo, they have co-pilots. So, you can have more than one pilot to fly the plane.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1866<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, my Director-General of Public Health, Daniel Wang, said, "Yes, better still, if we do not stop with the co-pilot concept, but towards auto-pilot too." That, basically, is to make protecting the environment second nature to the 3P partners. The CEO of NEA, BG Lum Joon Khoi, then added what, in my view, is the best reason for moving from ship to Jumbo Jet.&nbsp; He said, "In the case of a ship, even if you are a captain of the ship, you can still jump ship, even though you are the last one to jump. &nbsp;But in the case of the Jumbo, when the three co-pilots are in the same plane, there is no way that they can jump off the plane."&nbsp; In other words, all of us will be committed to the same destination in managing our environment.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this indeed is the new mindset in the ENV, NEA and PUB. When we talk about sustaining the good performance of the environment, we no longer adopt the old mindset of looking at ENV as the captain of this environmental ship. Instead, we now look at our 3P partners as co-pilots. We are now three co-owners and we have to work together to go into auto-pilot mode, so that everybody in Singapore, whether you are in private sector, public sector or people sector, will look at protecting our environment as second nature to us.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some Members may wonder whether all this talk about transforming 3P partnership into 3P ownership is just talk and no action. I want to assure the House that we are putting action and money where our mouth is. The NEA, started two years ago, has established a 3P partnership fund. They drew on the resources from the various programmes, put them together, to support various 3P programmes. Last year, we had a fund size of $750,000. For this year, NEA intends to increase it to $1 million. We use these resources to work with our 3P owners in various areas. eg, in Little India, there is now a Little India Environment <p align=left>Column: 1867<p>Watch. In the case of public toilets, there is a programme launched by the Restroom Association of Singapore known as "Happy Toilets". These are just examples of what we are doing now with our 3P owners.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example - in our schools, we talk about students with straight As. In ENV, we talk about food courts with straight As. In the past, we went to a food court and we certified hygiene standard stall by stall - A, B or C. Now, we have a self-regulating programme. The food courts can self-regulate, take measures to improve their hygiene so that the entire food court can qualify for A grading. Food Junction now has 14 food courts with straight As grading. &nbsp;Another one is Banquet: its eight food courts are all straight As.&nbsp; This is a result of 3P ownership. Instead of us checking on them, they now regulate and check themselves, and they introduce necessary measures themselves.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the Singapore Environmental Council, likewise, we are working with them to introduce the concept of a pro-environment club, bringing together business organisations that want to support environmental programmes. Of course, the most significant 3P ownership programme that was undertaken last year was the launch of the Singapore's OK for the community. We now work with a few thousand grassroots leaders and volunteers in making sure that Singapore's OK is being permeated to the ground.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we move from partnership to ownership, it is very important to recognise that we are in this together - because we live in the same <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we breathe the same air, we drink the same water, and we live in the same safe and healthy environment. We must all recognise that there is no easy way out <p align=left>Column: 1868<p>towards environmental sustainability. We have to make it happen, by working together.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin pointed out the importance of strengthening mutual understanding among the 3P partners. Sir, I agree with him fully. As we move from 3P partnership to 3P ownership, the key issue is whether we are able to bring the level of public education to a higher plane. If the members of the public do not understand what we are trying to do and what needs to be done to strengthen our environmental sustainability, then many of the plans that we have under the SGP 2012 cannot come true. This is the reason why we have decided to launch Singapore Clean Report. Members of the House who have the chance to flip through this Report will notice that this Report is written in a very simple to understand manner. Some Members may wonder why it is so simple. After all, this is not meant just for primary school kids, but for the members of the public.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, I want to relate a real situation. I was told that when the World Trade Centre building was first built, they put in the fastest lifts they could find at that time. But within a few days, many of those who went to the top of the World Trade Centre came down with a common complaint that the lifts were too slow. The engineers could not understand why. They said, "Look, this is the fastest lift we can get in the market, but the people still complain that it is too slow. What more can we do?" The building management asked the engineers to design an even faster lift than the fastest lift. The engineers said, "It cannot be done, because this will compromise the safety standard."</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, out of the blue, a person who knew nothing about engineering but knew a lot about human psychology said, "Maybe the problem is not the speed of the lift because, after all, we know that <p align=left>Column: 1869<p>this is the fastest lift". &nbsp;He felt the problem was more to do with human psychology. When you are with a group of strangers in a confined space, you do not know where to put your eyes.&nbsp; If you look at the other person, the person does not like it.&nbsp; You stare at the ceiling, there is nothing to see.&nbsp; So they feel very awkward in the lift, and every second seems like a long time.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, "Why don't we do this?&nbsp; We put mirrors on the four walls inside the lift, so that they can look at themselves and see whether their hair is all right, etc."&nbsp; That was what they did. &nbsp;It was such a simple solution and it solved the problem. After they installed the lifts with mirrors, there was not a single complaint that the lifts were too slow.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has this got to do with the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> clean card?&nbsp; When we talk about sustainability, we have to talk about public education. We need members of the public to understand not just what are we trying to do, but more importantly, why we are trying to do all these. &nbsp;If we are not able to explain things in simple terms, if we are not able to do our best to KISS - keep it short and simple - then we are going to confuse the public. &nbsp;There is a Chinese saying, <I>zhi qi ran, pu zhi qi suoyi ran</I>.&nbsp; They say, "You want me to recycle, but why is it so important to recycle?&nbsp; You tell them that in the future, we may have to tighten our emission standard and save energy, and they wonder why." &nbsp;Through this Singapore Clean Report, we are actually adopting a human psychological angle now.&nbsp; We are not trying to give instructions to the members of the public, because the harder we try to enforce, the harder we try to instruct, I think the more they will resist. Instead, we try to explain and help members of the public understand why the threat of environmental disaster is real</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>and it is important that we do what is necessary.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1870<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="17" Minute="0">5.00 pm</st1:time></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members can see that we use simple graphic and user-friendly language in this Report. We hope that, in time to come, members of the public will understand much more about environmental performance and environmental sustainability. Hopefully, the day will come when we talk about the environment, we will not be talking about "The Environment", but "Our Environment".&nbsp; This would be the day when we can truly say that we have all taken ownership of the environment.&nbsp; Sir, this is also why I am thinking of changing the name of our Ministry - from the Ministry of the Environment to the Ministry of Our Environment.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to address some of the specific issues raised by the Members regarding how sustainable is the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> environment.&nbsp; Mr Othman Haron asked whether our air quality is one of the cleanest in the world.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua and Dr Amy Khor asked how does it compare with international standards and what are the new areas of concern.&nbsp; They talked about the rising trend of asthma and asked whether this has to do with the air quality.&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng asked what strategy we have to improve air quality.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the air quality in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> today is certainly one of the best in the world.&nbsp; All the major pollutants - sulphur dioxide, particulate matter 10, nitrogen oxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, and so on, are all within the international standards. Certainly, we have one of the best air quality in the world.&nbsp; However, for us to continue to enjoy this good quality of air, there are two things we need to do.&nbsp; Firstly, we have to keep the level of the established air pollutants to within the international standards, just like what we have done up to now.&nbsp; At the same time, we must continue to identify new <p align=left>Column: 1871<p>pollutants and make sure that these new pollutants are brought within the international standards.&nbsp; In this regard, one of such new pollutants which is attracting a lot of attention from Members of the House is PM 2.5 which stands for particulate matter 2.5.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PM 2.5 is a very small particle, just the size of 1/20th of the diameter of our hair.&nbsp; Various studies have shown that PM 2.5 can be harmful to our health if we are exposed to unhealthy level.&nbsp; For example, it could lead to bronchitis or asthma.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it is important for us to make sure that the emission of PM 2.5 is under control in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; PM 2.5 is a newly identified pollutant. At this moment, there are still no international standards.&nbsp; The WHO has not defined a standard for PM 2.5 yet.&nbsp; But the US-EPA, about six years ago, had already identified and defined the standards for major cities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; In line with the spirit of observing best practices, we have decided to observe the same standards as well.&nbsp; As of now, most of the major cities in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region> are still not able to meet this standard of PM 2.5.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> too. &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the House may wonder where does PM 2.5 come from.&nbsp; Sir, PM 2.5 comes from three sources.&nbsp; Firstly, from power generation and industry, and they account for 30% of the PM 2.5 in our air.&nbsp; Secondly, background sources - these are particles from natural sources, nothing much we can do, and they account for 20%.&nbsp; And the remaining 50% of PM 2.5 in our air comes from vehicles, and in particular, diesel vehicles.&nbsp; Today, the emission standard in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is Euro II.&nbsp; Diesel in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is used mainly for taxis, commercial vehicles and buses.&nbsp; Collectively, they account for almost all the PM 2.5 in our air as far as vehicular emission is concerned.&nbsp; In other words, 50% of the PM 2.5 comes from the taxis, commercial vehicles and buses.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1872<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay and several Members commented that we should do something to tighten emission standard. Mr Ong Kian Min asked when we can move to Euro III and suggested that we might want to leapfrog to Euro IV. Sir, it is true that, in 2001, we introduced the Euro II as an emission standard for all vehicles, including diesel vehicles.&nbsp; At that point in time, we gave the industries two years advanced notice.&nbsp; The intention at that point was to follow-up with the introduction of Euro III following Euro II. &nbsp; However, because of slow economic growth in the past few years, we did not want to add to the burden of the industries and businesses. Since our air quality was still within the international standards, we decided to defer the implementation of Euro III.&nbsp; But, now that we have decided to tackle the issue of PM 2.5, we have made a reassessment.&nbsp; If we were to move from Euro II to Euro III, we will not be able to bring the level of PM 2.5 to within the standards set by US-EPA because Euro III vehicles still emit a certain amount of PM 2.5.&nbsp; The only way for us to meet the standard for PM 2.5 is for us, as recommended by Mr Ong Kian Min, to leapfrog from Euro II to Euro IV.&nbsp; However, we are fully aware, as pointed out by Prof. Low Seow Chay, that this would have cost implication, in terms of cost on public transport, cost of business, and so on.&nbsp; We therefore have to be mindful and introduce whatever measures possible to minimise the cost impact on the transportation industry and on members of the public.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to inform the House that the ENV has decided to adopt Euro IV as its next move to sustain clean air in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; However, Euro IV will not come into effect immediately, but only in October 2006.&nbsp; We are giving the industries 2½ years of lead time ahead of implementation.&nbsp; Over the next 2½ years, there are two things we need to do.&nbsp; On the part of the industry, they can plan for compliance and phase in Euro IV vehicles.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1873<p>But, more importantly, we have to find ways to introduce new options for the fleet owners to satisfy this Euro IV standard.&nbsp; Today, fleet owners in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> can obviously go for Euro IV diesel vehicles when Euro IV comes into effect.&nbsp; Various Members have described the advances in diesel vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is true.&nbsp; So Euro IV diesel vehicles that use ultra low sulphur diesel are obviously a solution.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is another solution, which is to make use of CNG vehicles.&nbsp; A CNG vehicle, in fact, emits almost no PM 2.5. It is even cleaner compared to Euro IV diesel since it does not emit PM 2.5 at all.&nbsp; We feel it is very important that we try to put in place the infrastructure for both options, so that by the time Euro IV comes into effect in October 2006, the industries, the fleet owners, the taxi owners, the bus owners, and so on, will have two options.&nbsp; They could either go for Euro IV diesel or go for CNG vehicles.&nbsp; Today, CNG is not an option yet.&nbsp; Because if you were to go for CNG vehicles, there is no refueling station.&nbsp; The infrastructure is not in place.&nbsp; So we are caught in a situation where the gas suppliers are not keen to roll out the CNG refueling network because there are no vehicles and no demand.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of the fleet owners, they are not able to move into CNG cars because there is no refueling network. The only way to solve this problem is to jump-start CNG vehicles in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> over the next 2½ years so that by the time Euro IV comes into operation in October 2006, the two alternatives will be in place.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, between now and October 2006, potentially, there are 5,000 taxis which are due for replacement.&nbsp; If we can put in place the incentives to enable these taxi operators to replace their Euro II diesel taxis with CNG taxis over the next 2½ years, we would have about 5,000 CNG <p align=left>Column: 1874<p>taxis by October 2006. This is indeed our intention. The Government has therefore decided to offer incentive support for CNG taxis during this transitional period between now and October 2006, so that CNG taxis can take off and compete with Euro IV diesel taxis in the open market by the year 2006.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tax incentive support, firstly, would include the green vehicle rebate.&nbsp; CNG taxis registered between now and end 2005 will enjoy the ARF rebate of 20% of the OMV and, on top of that, they will be exempted from special tax in the years 2004 and 2005.&nbsp; In addition, the Government has decided to offer an additional ARF rebate of equivalent to 80% of the OMV.&nbsp; What this means is that the taxi fleet owners, if they were to replace their Euro II diesel taxis with the CNG taxis,&nbsp;will be able to enjoy ARF rebate of up to 100% of the OMV, together with the exemption of special tax.&nbsp; With this, the life cycle cost of a CNG taxi will not be more than a Euro II diesel taxi, if registered between now and October 2006.&nbsp; In fact, it will be slightly lower.&nbsp; I want to emphasise that this incentive support is only applicable during this transitional period between now and October 2006 so that we can see the setting up of natural gas refueling infrastructure as well as achieving a base of CNG taxis.&nbsp; After October 2006, there will be two viable options of CNG taxis and Euro IV diesel taxis. Both will have to compete in the open market.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NEA and LTA will brief the taxi and the bus operators and the gas suppliers on why we need to move towards Euro IV and details of the tax rebate and exemption of the special tax at a separate session.&nbsp; I hope that the taxi operators will take advantage of this tax rebate during this transitional period so that, hopefully, we will see the first batch of CNG vehicles operating in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> by the end of this year. This will mark a new beginning of green cars here in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <p align=left>Column: 1875<p>to enable us to bring the air quality in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to come within the standard of PM 2.5 well before 2012.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Othman Haron asked whether we are effectively reducing carbon dioxide emission.&nbsp; Sir, the answer is yes.&nbsp; CNG and Euro IV&nbsp;will help to slow down the increase in green house gas emission. If we look at CO2 emission on a per capita basis, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> was ranked 18th highest in the world. This is unavoidable because we are a city state and an export oriented economy.&nbsp; As a result, much of the CO2 is emitted by factories producing goods for export, and the emission is counted against <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; This has made us the 18th highest, in terms of CO2 per capita emission.&nbsp; However, a fairer way to look at CO2 emission efficiency is CO2 per GDP dollar.&nbsp; We think that is a more relevant way of measuring CO2 emission efficiency.&nbsp; In that regard, I am happy to say that we are ranked 49th in the world, fairly low down.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With CNG vehicles coming on stream in conjunction with the introduction of Euro IV standard, this will come down further.&nbsp; These CNG vehicles will emit 10-30% less CO2 compared to Euro II diesel vehicles.&nbsp; Together with proper maintenance of all vehicles as well as our campaign to save electricity in households and factories, and our efforts to promote the greater use of clean energy, I believe that we can collectively reduce CO2 emission on per GDP dollar basis, progressively in a sustainable manner.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to move on to indoor air quality.&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what is the indoor air quality in Singapore today, whether it is possible to have an index for indoor air quality. Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether we have any strategy to improve indoor air quality.&nbsp; Sir, I agree with the Members that good indoor air quality is important because many of us<p align=left>Column: 1876<p> spend a lot of time indoors. I am happy to say that the indoor air quality in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is generally good and safe.&nbsp; In 1996, the Ministry of the Environment published the guidelines for good indoor air quality in office premises.&nbsp; We stipulate the acceptable limits for indoor air pollutants, eg, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, suspended particles, total bacteria and fungal counts, and so on.</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="17" Minute="15">5.15 pm</st1:time></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Members may wonder why we publish only a guideline and not regulation for enforcement.&nbsp; To the best of our knowledge, this is an international practice, where the government authority will provide the guidelines as it is the responsibility of the building owners and management to ensure that the best practices are being adopted.&nbsp; We will continue to promote these best practices, so that these guidelines can be observed and the indoor air quality can remain good.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin touched on poor maintenance of air-conditioning and ventilation system.&nbsp; I do not disagree with him.&nbsp; From time to time, we do come across buildings where maintenance procedures can be further enhanced.&nbsp; This is the reason why the Singapore Environmental Institute conducts training for the building management personnel, so that they can learn how to abide by the specifications for ventilation systems under the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> standard code of practices for mechanical ventilation and air-conditioning in buildings.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to further enhance indoor air quality, NEA is now studying the possibility of drawing up a series of code of practices to supplement the guidelines.&nbsp; This series of code of practices will touch on more specific measures for various types of indoor environment and take into consideration the duration of stay, such as shopping malls versus offices. &nbsp; These<p align=left>Column: 1877<p> specific measures for different kinds of environment can become a more formal instrument.&nbsp; In time to come, if there is a need to regulate some practices in the code, we are prepared to do so, but not at this juncture. &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last but not least, I want to assure the House that, from time to time, we will not hesitate to enact legislation to address a public health concern when necessary.&nbsp; For example, three years ago, in 2001, we enacted the Environmental Public Health Act on the cooling towers and water fountains. The outcome was that we managed to reduce the Legionnaire cases by one third over three years, from 65 in 2000, to 45 last year.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to move on to solid waste management.&nbsp; Several Members asked whether clean land in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> today is sustainable.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked about the progress we have made in recycling and whether there is enough landfill in the long term.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua also asked about the progress and what is new in recycling.&nbsp; Let me emphasise here again that managing solid wastes is a global challenge.&nbsp; What do <st1:City><st1:place>New York City</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:City><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:City> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> have in common? All three cities are short of landfill sites.&nbsp; <st1:City><st1:place>New York City</st1:place></st1:City> solves the problem by transporting rubbish as far as 480 kilometres away for landfill.&nbsp; In the case of <st1:City><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:City>, it is reported that the City will run out of landfill capacity very soon.&nbsp; They are looking for new solutions as well.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I would like to reiterate that there is no more landfill site left on the main island.&nbsp; Pulau Semakau is the one we are using today, and it can last for 25 years.&nbsp; Even if we were to double the size of Pulau Semakau, in time to come, it will last for 50 years at the most. Beyond that, what do we do?&nbsp; In the past, from 1970 onwards, we solved our solid waste challenge mainly through volume <p align=left>Column: 1878<p>reduction.&nbsp; We sent the waste for burning and, in the process, reduce the volume of the waste by up to 90%.&nbsp; That was how we addressed our solid waste problem.&nbsp; If we keep on doing that, firstly, we need to build quite a number of incineration plants to burn all the rubbish.&nbsp; Secondly, we will still run out of landfill sites one day, because the bottom ash from incineration will still need to be landfill.&nbsp; This is the reason why we moved beyond incineration towards recycling about 10 years ago, so that we can reduce incineration and reduce the demand for landfill.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I am happy to say that our environment industry is becoming more capable and innovative in the area of waste recycling.&nbsp; For example, we now have the capability to recycle electronic waste into precious metals, wood waste into compost, horticultural waste into charcoal, construction and demolition waste into secondary aggregates. The list goes on.&nbsp; In fact, 94% of the construction and demolition waste in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> was recycled last year.&nbsp; This is just one illustration of how far we have come in recycling.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is even more exciting, as mentioned by several Members here, is that we have expanded the recycling culture beyond the industries to include the households as well.&nbsp; The national recycling programme for households started in 2001. We are happy to see that 45% of our households in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> are now taking part in recycling. We hope to achieve 55% by the end of this year.&nbsp; Together, the industries and households have been able to increase our overall recycling rate in terms of tonnage from 40% three years ago to 47% last year.&nbsp; This is a very significant improvement.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is even more exciting is that we are beginning to see the fruits of our recycling effort.&nbsp; Last year, we - industries and households together - produced 10% less waste, compared to 2000. We<p align=left>Column: 1879<p> are seeing a reverse trend now in waste generation.&nbsp; At this rate, Pulau Semakau will be able to last another 10 years longer.&nbsp; So, instead of 25 years, it will be 35 years.&nbsp; At the same time, we will be able to save on the construction of three incineration plants every 40 years.&nbsp; Even though this is very good, we do not think it is good enough.&nbsp; We must continue to recycle more waste streams - incineration bottom ash, food waste and more.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue to promote recycling by the households. One area of emphasis this year will be the condominiums because, as of now, only 20% of the condominiums are taking part in recycling. We hope more will come on board.&nbsp; Hopefully, we will achieve 35% by the end of this year.&nbsp; At the same time, in public places, we will put more public bins, up from 4,500 last year, to 5,500 this year.&nbsp; This will help reinforce the recycling message on a day-to-day basis to members of the public.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked whether we could do more to educate the young.&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; In fact, we now have a recycling programme targeting at the schools. We hope more schools will come on board.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua suggested that we should bring more members of the public to visit our landfill sites, recycling plants, and other facilities. This is an excellent idea and is something we will do more in future.

The obvious examples of this would be cleaning of the floor and common areas&nbsp;by the Town Councils, other applications such as fish farming, aquariums, watering of plants and used as animal feeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, if the application is suitable using untreated water of high volume, it will save cost for the industries and also save all the resources&nbsp;of the Government for doing the unnecessary water treatment.&nbsp; There are many sources where untreated water could be made available.&nbsp; The simplest one is collection of rainwater.&nbsp; The other will be to pump water&nbsp;from the open water courses, like the river, "<i>long kang</i>" or canal.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Before the advent of today's modern water treatment facilities, many people rely solely on the collection of rain water for households, landscape and agricultural uses.&nbsp; In water-scarce Singapore, Singapore's abundant rainfall of about 1,700 millimetres is a natural source of precious water.&nbsp; Instead of allowing the rain water to run off into the rivers, we should allow Singaporeans to collect it where possible.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rain water collection and harvesting can simply be described as channelling the rain water collected in gutters through a sediment filter and, finally, into a storage tank for later use.&nbsp; Harvested rain<p align=left>Column: 1885<p> water can be used to wash cars, water plants and cleaning purposes.&nbsp; In some parts of the world, people still depend on rain water collection to meet most of their water needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even in those communities where many residents are supplied with public water for drinking, home owners and businesses are turning to rain water collection systems to meet non-potable water needs, such as landscape watering especially in the dry regions of the US.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The advantages of self-collection are two-fold.&nbsp; Firstly, from the nation's point of view, more water can be stored for human consumption, instead of wasting treated water for cleaning.&nbsp;

At the Bedok Reservoir, as mentioned by the Member, there is also&nbsp;a jogging track that is well within the reservoir park, and also a track around the reservoir, which, as the Member probably knows, is used by the PUB for its inspection of the reservoir and for carrying out various other activities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in these areas and others, the PUB will continue to work with the relevant agencies to explore&nbsp;ways to provide more amenities for our reservoir parks.&nbsp; This will make the parks more attractive, for families to spend leisurely outings at these scenic locations.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Swee Say:</B> Sir, of the two water agreements with <st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the one signed in 1961 will expire in 2011. &nbsp; This is less than 10 years away.&nbsp; Several Members, Mr Othman Haron, Mr Zainul Abidin and Dr Teo Ho Pin, asked whether we are on track to increase our local supply to make up for the provision under the 1961 Agreement.&nbsp; Sir, the answer is yes.&nbsp; In the last few years, we have taken various actions.&nbsp; First, to enlarge our local catchment areas.&nbsp; The Marina Barrage will be completed by 2007-2008.&nbsp; The Seletar/Serangoon Reservoir Scheme, Phase I, is on schedule.&nbsp; Likewise, the integration of reservoirs to increase yield is also underway.&nbsp; Sir, well before 2011, we would have increased our local supply sufficiently to make up for the loss of the water supply under the 1961 Agreement.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enlarging the local catchment areas is just one of the three strategies.&nbsp; The other one is NEWater.&nbsp; Sir, at this moment, three plants are already up and running at Bedok, Kranji and Seletar.&nbsp; The fourth one is on the way, to be built in Ulu Pandan.&nbsp; NEWater would also add to our water supply.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third strategy is desalination.&nbsp; The desalination plant is done on a Design,<p align=left>Column: 1893<p> Build, Own&nbsp;and Operate (DBOO) basis.&nbsp; Groundbreaking was done in January and the plant should be ready by the end of next year.&nbsp; Together, these three strategies of enlarging our local catchment areas, NEWater and desalination will provide additional capacity more than enough to make up for the quantity provided for in the 1961 Agreement.&nbsp; What this means is that water supply will not be affected by the expiry of the 1961 Agreement in 2011.&nbsp; Our 4-Tap strategy, with three &nbsp; now in place and one more to come, will make us become more self-sufficient in future, and at the same time make our water supply system more reliable, resilient and sustainable.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several Members asked whether the introduction of desalination and NEWater would lead to higher cost of water in the future.&nbsp; Let me explain it this way.&nbsp; In 1997, when we were looking at desalination as a reliable source of future water supply, the cost at that point in time was about $2 per cubic metre.&nbsp; This was in 1997.&nbsp; Today, the good news is that desalination does not cost that much.&nbsp; In fact, under the DBOO contract, the company, Hyflux, selected through an open tender, is going to supply desalinated water to the PUB with a starting price fixed at 78 cents per cubic metre in 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is significantly below the $2 projected in 1997.&nbsp; Of course, this purchase price of 78 cents is not static.&nbsp; The pricing formula takes into account fluctuation in the cost of energy, inflation and so on.&nbsp; The price of 78 cents covers only the production cost.&nbsp; PUB will have to incur additional cost in terms of transmission, storage, distribution and so on.&nbsp; However, the point here is that, with open competition and with advances in technology, we are now able to tap on water supply from one of the most cost competitive desalination plants in the world.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even better news is that NEWater will cost even less than desalination.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 1894<p>have been supplying NEWater to the industry for over a year now.&nbsp; Today, eight wafer fab plants in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> are using NEWater.&nbsp; There are 22 other customers, including major companies like Seagate, 3M and Senoko. Collectively, these customers consume about 10 million gallons of NEWater a day.&nbsp; By using NEWater, instead of PUB water, these companies are now able to save more than $3 million a year because NEWater supplied to them is cheaper than PUB water. This is because NEWater does not attract water conservation tax given its tremendous supply potential. We are aiming to enable more industries and companies to benefit from this lower cost of NEWater as PUB expands the reticulation network of NEWater.&nbsp; I mentioned earlier that we will have four NEWater plants.&nbsp; Each of the four NEWater plants will be supported by a reticulation network.&nbsp; The one in Ulu Pandan will be supported by a network in the western and central region.&nbsp; Bedok will be supported by a reticulation network in the east.&nbsp; The one at Seletar by one in the northeast, and the one in Kranji will be supported by a network in the northwest. With these four plants supported by four reticulation networks, industries and commercial buildings all over <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> will be able to draw on the NEWater in time to come.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Zainul asked whether the monopoly for the supply of high grade water on <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Jurong</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> will be terminated.&nbsp; Sir, it is useful for me to clarify that the role of the PUB is to supply water of potable standard.&nbsp; PUB is not in the business of supplying high grade water.&nbsp; For example, on the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Jurong</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>&nbsp;&nbsp; today, companies can take industrial water or PUB water from PUB, and process it into high grade water for petrochemical plants that require water quality which is cleaner than the PUB water.&nbsp; PUB has no intention of going into that business because the job of PUB is to provide water supply of potable standards and it will leave to the<p align=left>Column: 1895<p> industry to do the value-add.&nbsp; Of course, Mr Zainul may then ask: is NEWater not high grade water?&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; Because with reverse osmosis, NEWater is almost as good as high grade water.&nbsp; But I want to emphasise that supplying high grade water is really not the core business of PUB.&nbsp; In the case of Jurong Island, PUB will continue to supply PUB water and if there is a market demand, &nbsp; a company can go on to provide the high grade water.&nbsp; I do not rule out the possibility of extending the supply of NEWater to <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Jurong</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> one day. It all depends on whether it will fit into our overall strategy of replacing PUB water with NEWater for non-potable use.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, having said that the cost of desalination is a lot lower than what we expected in the year 1997 and that NEWater is cheaper than desalinated water, I want to point out that this does not mean that we will not see any increase in the cost of PUB water in the future.&nbsp; What it does mean is that we need not increase water tariffs so soon, and by so much, as compared to the situation we were in in 1997.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Zainul Abidin and Dr Teo Ho Pin asked, beyond this 4-Tap Strategy, whether we are looking at other sources of supply.&nbsp; As far as the PUB is concerned, PUB basically has two functions:&nbsp; firstly, to ensure that water supply will always be sufficient to meet our needs today and in the future; secondly, to keep the cost of water supply to our industry and households as affordable as possible.&nbsp; Having put together a 4-Tap Strategy - water from Johore, local catchments water, desalination and NEWater - we now have a workable solution.&nbsp; But, of course, at any point in time, if we are able to identify new sources that can supply water on a long term basis, not just for the next 5-10 years but the next 50-100 years, which is able to further enhance<p align=left>Column: 1896<p> the reliability of supply as well as the affordability of supply, PUB is always open to those ideas.&nbsp; But the important point is that we do have a workable solution today and that Singapore can be assured of having sufficient water supply post-2011, and post-2061 too because we can be self-sufficient, if need be, in the long term.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether more can be done to create local entrepreneurship in our water industry.&nbsp; He asked whether it is possible for us to find ways to upgrade the technology in the industry by allowing the water industry to test out new ideas, new concepts, new technology, new processes, using the PUB facilities.&nbsp; Sir, the answer is yes.&nbsp; The PUB and the NEA, together with the EDB, have launched the Environmental Test-bedding Initiative (ETI).&nbsp; Under the ETI, companies in the industry are encouraged to try out their innovations, new processes and new technology at some of our public facilities.&nbsp; Together, between PUB, NEA and the industry, we can jointly explore the new frontiers in technology and innovation.&nbsp; Sir, we have started and we will continue to do more.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><st1:time Hour="18" Minute="0">6.00 pm</st1:time></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to move on to the area of water conservation.&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked whether PUB will step up plans to promote water conservation.&nbsp; Sir, this is a very important point.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>Even though we have formulated workable solutions for our long-term water supply, we must continue to recognise that every drop of water is precious.&nbsp; For the last five years, we have done very well.&nbsp; On a per person basis, each Singaporean, on the average, consumed 165 litres of water per day, compared to 203 litres in <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>, 254 litres in <st1:City><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp; We are one of the lower water consuming people among major cities.

In some cases, as high as 8-10%.&nbsp; This year, we hope that more will do so.&nbsp; The target of PUB is to reach out to another 200,000 households this year for the installation of water saving devices.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo asked if we can enact legislation to require water conservation. Sir, to some extent, we do have some regulations in place.&nbsp; For example, water flow in toilets in non-domestic premises has to be less than six litres per minute. But yet at the same time, PUB is talking to these building management people to see if they can go below the approved limit of six litres per minute.&nbsp; I was told that more than 200 buildings have responded so far.&nbsp; Some of them are now going for as low as two litres per minute of flow rate.&nbsp; Of course, we do not require buildings to observe that ultra low flow rate. We encourage but leave it to them to decide.&nbsp; The key consideration is to keep the flow rate as low as possible without affecting the effectiveness of these devices.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for factories and businesses, they are recyling more too.&nbsp; One interesting development with NEWater is that some commercial buildings are now using NEWater for aircon cooling towers.&nbsp; We asked the building management how do they find NEWater.&nbsp; We expect them to tell us that NEWater is good because it <p align=left>Column: 1898<p>costs 15% less.&nbsp; But, surprisingly, they told us that not only NEWater is cost competitiveness, they are also able to reduce water consumption by up to another 20% because of the high quality of NEWater.&nbsp; These buildings are now able to save not just 15% of lower cost but also another 20% due to lower water consumption.&nbsp; As we roll out NEWater, more and more buildings will be able to recycle more using NEWater due to the extra pureness of NEWater.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time, we will continue to work with the water industry to encourage faster pace of innovation, as mentioned by Prof. Low Seow Chay earlier.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the status of the DTSS&nbsp; -&nbsp; Deep Tunnel Sewerage System; when do we phase out the existing plants and whether this would increase waste water treatment fees. Sir, treatment cost of waste water is likely to go up in the future for two reasons.&nbsp; Firstly, the removal of solid, bacteria and smell from waste water is land intensive, energy intensive and capital intensive.&nbsp; Over time, as land cost goes up, as energy cost goes up, as capital cost goes up, the cost of treatment is likely to go up too.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also useful to remind the House that even though water-borne fees were last adjusted in 2000 to the current level of 30 cents per cubic metre for the domestic sector and 60 cents per cubic metre for the non-domestic sector,&nbsp; these rates still do not reflect the full cost of waste water treatment.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What PUB is doing is to slow down the cost of increase through the implementation of DTSS.&nbsp; Dr Teo asked whether we have to pay more because of DTSS. Sir, it is the reverse.&nbsp; Over the next 40 years, we basically have two options.&nbsp; One option is for us to upgrade and expand existing water reclamation plants&nbsp; -&nbsp; we have six of them.&nbsp; PUB projected that over the next 40 years, it will cost <p align=left>Column: 1899<p>PUB $8.6 billion to upgrade and expand existing water reclamation plants &nbsp; to cater for the increase in water consumption and thereby a higher volume of waste water to be treated.&nbsp; That is one option.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The second option which PUB is doing now is to build the DTSS.&nbsp; By building the DTSS, because of economies of scale, we are able to bring the cost of development from $8.6 billion down to $5.9 billion.&nbsp; This will result in a saving of $2.7 billion.&nbsp; As I mentioned, it is basically due to economies of scale in the building of waste treatment plants. With DTSS, eventually, we need only two waste treatment plants - one in Changi and the other in Jurong.&nbsp; The economies of scale enable us to bring down the cost of development.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Sir, the DTSS is on schedule.&nbsp; It will be completed by the year 2008 and start receiving and treating waste water from the northern region and eastern region. Existing plants will be phased out progressively, from the year 2007.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to emphasise again that PUB is doing its best to keep cost down.&nbsp; There is now a new mindset in PUB.&nbsp; Since the new CEO of PUB, Mr Khoo Teng Chye&nbsp; -&nbsp; Members of the House may remember that he spent some time with PSA, and he is quite used to market competition&nbsp; -&nbsp; came on board late last year, he is inculcating a new mindset in PUB - away from cost plus, towards price minus. &nbsp;He has set up 12 price-minus teams in PUB. &nbsp; The challenge of these price-minus teams in PUB is to look for ways to reduce the cost of water treatment through the use of new technology, more innovative processes as well as better management of the assets. &nbsp;At the same time, we need members of the public to play their part too, because every drop does count.&nbsp; And, remember, every drop saved will mean saving not just the cost of producing the <p align=left>Column: 1900<p>drop, but the cost of treating that drop of waste water as well.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, the affordability of water supply depends a lot on supply efficiency and demand conservation.&nbsp; For supply efficiency, we believe that by adopting the best sourcing approach, by optimising our assets, by exploiting advances in technology, we can bring supply efficiency to as high a level as possible.&nbsp; At the same time, we need to count on the support of the members of the public, the industry and the commercial sector to help derive maximum effect in the area of water conservation.&nbsp; Only when everyone plays his part, can Singaporeans be assured of always having enough water, and always finding our water supply affordable.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On dengue, I would like to congratulate NEA in roping over 600 volunteers around Singapore who are actively involved in educating their fellow residents in their estates on how to prevent the Aedes mosquitoes from breeding, and give feedback on places where breeding is likely to take place.&nbsp; They belong to the dengue prevention volunteer groups led by NEA.&nbsp; More volunteers could be roped in, considering the number of cases tripled to nearly 4,800 people for the whole of 2003.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the Ministry of the Environment's press release on 14th February on the figures last month, I am concerned over the statistics.&nbsp; The figure is alarming, despite the huge effort put in by NEA for the past years, eg, the preventive inspection of houses and flats, warning letters, hefty fines and post-fogging of areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a few questions for the Minister.&nbsp; What measures can we take to address the dengue problem?&nbsp; Although the Ministry is aware of the five-year cycle, this recent cycle had seen six deaths.&nbsp; What preventive measures does the Ministry of the Environment&nbsp;have to prevent this five-year cycle?&nbsp; Can the Minister give an update on how NEA is<p align=left>Column: 1902<p> tackling this problem in the light of the severity of the outbreak in Indonesia?&nbsp; Is there any risk of the strain of mosquito in Indonesia being transported here through airplanes or on board ships?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third concern I have is the breeding grounds found in roof gutters of private houses and properties.&nbsp; Many are due to the inherent design and installation, which have not taken into account the threat of dengue fever in the past.&nbsp; Many of these defective designs are potential breeding grounds awaiting for an outbreak.&nbsp; I have highlighted in this House previously&nbsp;and asked NEA, being the lead agency on dengue, to seek the cooperation of the Building Control Authority and the residents in resolving this issue.&nbsp; It has been some months and I have yet to receive any updates, as I volunteer to work on this issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a part of the private estate in Hillside, Yio Chu Kang, which is under my management.&nbsp; There is a constant threat of a dengue outbreak any time&nbsp;if the existing unreachable gutters are not removed.&nbsp; The Ministry should continuously work with the various Government agencies in eradicating these breeding grounds permanently, instead of using biological levicide to control breeding in roof gutters.&nbsp; I understand that this biological control agent from USA is a special formulation of bacteria which, I feel, is again a temporary measure, as it lasts only for three months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.15 pm</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Othman Haron Eusofe--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The old marketplace and hawker centre at Bedok Reservoir Road would soon be redeveloped and, once ready, it will be converted into a kind of a harmony hub.&nbsp; The HDB has been very helpful, similarly the Aljunied Town Council and NEA.&nbsp; My question to the Minister is: what is the progress of the Hawker Centre Upgrading Programme in Singapore?&nbsp; I believe it makes sense for the Environment Ministry and NEA to take over the management of hawker centres and wet markets.&nbsp; Are there plans to place them under one agency?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Wet Markets/Hawker Centres</I><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ang Mong Seng</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, in last year&rsquo;s debate, I suggested that the Ministry of the Environment should have a centralised control of all the wet markets and food centres, so as not to cause<p align=left>Column: 1905<p> confusion among the stallholders.&nbsp; From what I know, the Ministry of the Environment has taken over from HDB the control of all the wet markets and food centres.&nbsp; I would like to ask whether the authority will also take over from the town councils, the control of their hawker centres and food centres, so as to have a better management of all wet markets and hawkers centres in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have also suggested that there should be more wet markets in the new HDB housing estates. This was met with enthusiastic feedback from many residents. The residents still enjoy going to the wet market to buy their fresh food.&nbsp;&nbsp; The price is reasonable and the food is fresh. As such, I would like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry has plans to build more wet markets in the HDB estates and the new towns for the benefit of the residents.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</B> Sir, we are uniquely Singaporeans.&nbsp; Going to&nbsp;the hawker centre and fresh market is part of our habit.&nbsp; Many of my generation grew up with it.&nbsp; For many in the older generation, these trips mark the start of their day.&nbsp; I used "fresh market" because of the environmentally unhygienic connotation of wet market.&nbsp; You may ask: why push for wet markets (fresh markets) and hawker centres?&nbsp; Simply because after hearing pleas from my constituents, I believe people want fresh markets.&nbsp; It means that fresh produce usually comes without the trappings that signal high price.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;the place where they go and meet their friends.&nbsp; The market stalls are to many what Starbucks is to the young.&nbsp; The markets and hawker centres are themselves the centre of the town.&nbsp; It is itself the heart of the heartlands.&nbsp; One cannot underestimate the rapport between the market stallholders and their customers.&nbsp; Much as we talk about customer service, or the lack of it, in our retail sector last week, it is certainly not what is happening in our markets and hawker centres.&nbsp; A<p align=left>Column: 1906<p> relationship with your friendly neighbourhood fishmonger could mean the difference between whether&nbsp;he keeps the fish head for you or not.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we seek modernity, this is the social habit that we should not change.&nbsp; The impersonal and selfish attitude that high-rise flat living has engendered could be mitigated by a thriving market in every town.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister to consider stepping up the building of more markets and hawker centres, especially for the residents of Anchorvale and Fernvale?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to know whether the public toilet upgrading programme has been completed and the problem of unsightly public toilets resolved, so that next year we do not have to talk about it anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what is the progress of the upgrading of public toilets, whether our hygienic standard has already reached international standard, as in Japan and Korea.&nbsp; And how many of them have been given the Singapore's OK labels?&nbsp; Is the Minister happy with this progress?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister also mentioned in last year's budget debate that Singapore had then more than 800 coffeeshops where the toilets were waiting to be upgraded.&nbsp; How many of these have already been upgraded?&nbsp; How much have&nbsp;&nbsp;we spent on the upgrading programme, how many more public toilets need to be upgraded, and when can we expect the entire upgrading programme to be completed?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Clearly, the <p align=left>Column: 1907<p>environmental sector is an area for opportunity for industry development in our part of the world.&nbsp; I would like to know what measures the Ministry has undertaken to promote the sector as a business, using Singapore as a launch pad for the region and beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The second pertains more specifically to installation plants.&nbsp; I recall that the Ministry had undertaken some steps previously to privatise the plants, in total, including the assets and the operation.&nbsp; There is this particular industry that has two aspects to it which are important considerations when deciding on privatisation strategy.&nbsp; The first is that it is an extremely asset heavy and, in particular, because capacity is being determined by the Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact on the private operator, if there were to be any, on planning for capacity would be quite substantial.&nbsp; The second is that measures like&nbsp;the recycling policy of the Ministry will also have an impact on the operations and the viability of such businesses.&nbsp; I think this has a substantial bearing on whether there should be privatisation and, if so, what modality it should take.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for the status on the Ministry&rsquo;s privatisation plans for the installation plants, and what approach they would be taking in this regard.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Traditionally, the environment industry offers low-paying jobs and employ many unskilled workers.&nbsp; This situation has changed as the industry evolves to be more innovative and explore new technologies.&nbsp; Although some environmental jobs are still labour <p align=left>Column: 1908<p>intensive, such as sweeping and mopping, there is room to redesign and add values to these jobs.&nbsp; Mechanisation has provided a new image to the environment industry.&nbsp; Today, a wide range of equipment and machines are used for different types of environmental jobs.&nbsp; The skills requirement of our workers have also increased, thus improving the image and salary package of our workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With more emphasis on keeping our environment okay, we should expand the scope of our environmental services.&nbsp; More specialists should be trained in areas, such as pest control, disease outbreak management, disaster and emergency management.&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:&nbsp; (1) What is the progress of the "1,000 for 1,000" initiative?&nbsp; (2) Are there plans to create more jobs in the environment industry?&nbsp; (3) Is there any work redesign initiative to make environmental jobs more attractive to Singaporeans?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>International Collaboration</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I go on to my next cut.&nbsp; Environmental issues and problems are always borderless and may affect neighbouring countries.&nbsp; The haze from Indonesia is a good example as to how air quality in Singapore can be affected.&nbsp; The recent outbreak of SARS also shows that disease can cross boundary through human carriers.&nbsp; As such, the need for international cooperation to manage environmental problems has become more pertinent.&nbsp; Besides establishing systems and communication channels, there must be more concerted efforts to garner political view to address environmental issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions: (1) How is the Ministry leveraging on international cooperation to improve environmental performance in Singapore?&nbsp;
