Malaysia then applied for provisional measures to the International Tribunal for the Law of Sea (ITLOS) on 5th September 2003.&nbsp; On 8th October 2003, ITLOS rejected Malaysia's request.&nbsp; Instead, it ordered the two Governments to appoint a group of independent experts to carry out a joint study of Singapore's land reclamation works, to be completed within a year.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the months that followed the ITLOS Order, the land reclamation issue comprised two parallel processes.&nbsp; On one track, Singapore and Malaysia jointly implemented the Order by appointing a group of four experts to carry out the joint study.&nbsp; On the other track, Singapore and Malaysia were parties to the arbitration case.&nbsp; Since the second track depended on the outcome of the first track, the arbitration was suspended by mutual agreement pending the completion of the joint study.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Settlement Agreement that was signed on 26th April 2005 represents a full and definitive resolution of both processes.&nbsp; Malaysia has agreed to terminate its arbitration case against Singapore.&nbsp; Both parties are in the process of applying to the Tribunal for a final Award based on the terms of the Agreement signed.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Road to settlement</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;The joint study prescribed by ITLOS was carried out by an independent group of experts which comprised four professors of coastal engineering - two appointed by each side.&nbsp; The GOE was assisted by an independent consultant - DHI Water &amp;

&nbsp;Malaysia had claimed that Singapore's reclamation was "causing and has the potential to cause serious and irreversible damage to the marine environment".&nbsp; The Group of Experts' task was to determine what adverse impacts had or would occur.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The GOE submitted its Report to both Governments on 5th November 2004.&nbsp; We have made the Report available on the MFA and MND websites.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is important to understand that the Group of Experts&nbsp;had carefully studied all of Malaysia's allegations of harm.&nbsp; The experts were professional and thorough in their scrutiny of the possible impacts from our reclamation works.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the study, the Group of Experts&nbsp;unanimously found "no major impacts" arising from our reclamation works.&nbsp; All four experts concurred on this very significant finding.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Group of Experts&nbsp;found that, from a total of 57 impacts arising from our reclamation works, 40 were classified as "slight", meaning that while they could be detected in mathematical models, they are unlikely to be detectable in the field. The remaining 17 of these impacts were classified in the "minor" to "moderate" range. The Group of Experts&nbsp;made seven recommendations to alleviate the identified impacts.&nbsp; All their recommendations were accepted by Malaysia and Singapore, and formed the basis for bilateral negotiations to find a resolution.&nbsp; After three rounds of negotiations, Malaysia and Singapore signed a full and final settlement of the case on 26th April 2005.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Considerations for settlement</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The considerations that led to the settlement are these:</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 572<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The main factor is that the expert study, which both countries had commissioned, had reached the unanimous conclusion that Singapore's reclamation works would cause no major impact to Malaysia.&nbsp; The minor and moderate impacts identified by the experts could be mitigated and both sides were prepared to implement these expert recommendations.&nbsp; Therefore, there was no necessity to pursue the matter further.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There had also been a shift in attitudes on both sides. This dispute arose in an earlier phase when bilateral relations were less amicable.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The subsequent improvement in bilateral relations over the course of the joint study, and the emphasis both sides placed on increasing win-win bilateral cooperation gave impetus to the resolution of&nbsp;the reclamation issue.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As far as Singapore was concerned, we had no difficulty accepting the recommendations in order to settle the dispute.&nbsp; The key recommendation, which was a change to the reclamation profile at the south-eastern part of Pulau Tekong, concerned the detailed design of an area where we had yet to finalise&nbsp;the detailed design.&nbsp; As for the amounts of money to be paid for remedial works and compensation, we took into account the fact that they were very small compared with what both sides would have to incur if they were to go through with the full arbitration process.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These factors collectively enabled both sides&nbsp;to settle the case in the&nbsp;spirit of goodwill and mutual benefit.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Conclusion</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking back, I would like to highlight two hallmarks of the joint study and <p align=left>Column:573<p>settlement negotiations.&nbsp; One,&nbsp;the involvement of an objective third party - ITLOS, the Group of Experts&nbsp;and the Arbitral Tribunal - which made possible an impartial and objective assessment of the facts of the case and the merits of the competing arguments.&nbsp; Two,&nbsp;the&nbsp;warmth and civility between the officials, experts and staff involved in this issue at all levels which contributed towards a happy ending.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As I have said at the signing ceremony, the manner in which this dispute has been settled gives us confidence that we can&nbsp;resolve our&nbsp;other bilateral disputes in a similar way.&nbsp; We have demonstrated in this case, and in the Pedra Branca case, that where there is an impasse, rather than let our bilateral relations be held hostage to a particular dispute, we are prepared to have the matter referred to third party adjudication or arbitration.&nbsp; As good neighbours, we can overcome such disputes on the basis of objectivity, mutual benefit and mutual respect.&nbsp;</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:INTEGRATED RESORTS--><p align=left>Column:573<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, when the two Integrated Resorts (IRs) are in full operation, they will have significant economic spillover to the rest of the economy.&nbsp; Based on the Request for<p align=left>Column: 574<p> Concept (RFC) proposals and studies on projects of similar scale abroad, MTI expects that about 10,000 jobs would be created within the two IRs.&nbsp; Most of these jobs would be in the non-gaming areas such as food and beverage, retail, and accommodation.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTI expects that the IRs will also create 25,000 jobs in the rest of the economy, mostly in services industries such as hotels, retail, food and beverage, entertainment, travel and transportation.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the vast majority of the jobs in the services sectors are done by locals, we expect that this will continue for the jobs created and supported by the IRs.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will seek to maximise for Singaporeans every job opportunity that comes with the IRs.&nbsp; MOM and the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will work with MTI and the Singapore Tourism Board, the training institutions as well as the successful developers of the two IRs, to train and equip Singaporeans with the skills required for occupations within the IRs.&nbsp; WDA has already been training Singaporeans for jobs in the tourism related services sectors, such as retail, hotels and restaurants.&nbsp; But this effort will need to be extended to equip Singaporeans with a stronger "software" for service excellence.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in tandem with preparing our workers to take up jobs in the IRs, an&nbsp;inter-Ministry team involving MOM/WDA, MTI and relevant agencies, will also look at the broader issue of improving Singapore's service culture in order to enhance the competitiveness of our services industries and our attractiveness as a tourist destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member alluded to Hong Kong Disneyland.&nbsp; As with Hong Kong Disneyland, there will be skills gaps in our local workforce for which the IRs would need to augment with foreigners who have the specific skills.&nbsp; In such cases,<p align=left>Column: 575<p> the IRs, like all other companies in the services sectors, would have to comply with the prevailing foreign worker employment policies and quotas.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under our current foreign worker employment policies,&nbsp;for every 100 jobs within the service sector (excluding foreign domestic workers), 89 are performed by locals.&nbsp; In other words, the foreign worker dependency is only about 10%. Therefore, if we can enhance our attractions and increase the number of tourists, we can expect that the overwhelming majority of jobs will go to Singaporeans.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):&nbsp;</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister three supplementary questions.&nbsp; In relation to the 10,000 direct and 25,000 indirect jobs, I am pleased to note that the Minister has said that an inter-Ministry committee will be set up to look at service standards.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if, in considering the upgrading of service standards, the Ministry would dedicate some funds to such programmes to improve the service quality gap in view of the fact that the World Economic Forum's service ranking has ranked Singapore 21st, which means that it has dropped by 10 positions from the last ranking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister if the Ministry would liaise with the successful tenderer to find out the type of workers that are needed in order to develop training programmes that will better prepare Singaporeans for the jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final question is whether the Ministry will also be discussing or is already in discussion with the ITEs, SHATEC, polytechnics and universities on the relevant courses that they can offer, so that these courses will be effective and<p align=left>Column:576<p> relevant in the training of the needed workers because some polytechnics, I note, have already started courses.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:&nbsp;</B> Sir, the short answer to all three questions is yes.&nbsp; Let me briefly elaborate on what the Member has asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thank her for her comments and fundamentally we agree that, taken at a broad level, we can upgrade our service culture.&nbsp; I said that we lack the service DNA but, as a scientist and a biologist, I would tell you that we can do many experiments to incorporate the DNA that we need.&nbsp; That is what we need to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to ramp up our attention to this broader aspect.&nbsp; In other words, while the building of IRs and other tourist attractions that we will need to focus on in the coming years will be the&nbsp;necessary condition, it may be insufficient if we do not follow it up with helping tourists leave Singapore with a positive impression of the Singapore experience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we will have to engage, as the Member has said, our training providers at the ITEs, polytechnics and the various service providers in the many areas of tourism hospitality.&nbsp; This is the focus of the inter-Ministry team involving staff members to look into these issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also identify skill gaps and specific occupations.&nbsp; But on that point, let me just reiterate what the Secretary-General of NTUC and Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Mr Lim Boon Heng, had nicely recounted.&nbsp; If you think about it, NTUC actually runs an IR already.&nbsp; It has Downtown East and it has many social clubs which are supported really in part by the jackpot room.&nbsp; The staff within the gaming component is less than 10% of all the other staff that the jobs provide, in other words, the rides and social amenities.&nbsp; So a similar concept will apply<p align=left>Column: 577<p> to IRs, in other words, the many&nbsp;jobs that it will bring will be in food and beverage, entertainment and tourist industries, and these are the areas that we can ramp up.&nbsp; So, yes, we will pay special attention to these areas in preparation for the integrated resorts.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:PUBLIC TRANSPORT FARE HIKES--><p align=left>Column: 577<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, the PTC will be adopting the recommendations made by the GPC-led Committee on the Fare Review Mechanism, which was adopted by the Government earlier this year.&nbsp; The Committee recommended that fare adjustments for each year be capped by the new fare adjustment formula, which is Price Index minus 0.3%.&nbsp; This formula allows the public transport operators to offset increases in their operating costs. It also ensures that commuter interests are protected by allowing them&nbsp;to share in the productivity gains achieved by the public transport operators.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the formula, the public transport operators are required to explain in detail the rationale for their applications and to support them with cost justifications. The&nbsp;PTC will then scrutinise the reported cost increases to determine if they are truly justifiable. Any fare increase is subject to a cap determined by the formula, which works out to 2.4% this year. This means that even if the operators' costs have increased by more than 2.4%, the maximum increase that they will receive&nbsp;will only be 2.4%.&nbsp; &nbsp;In making its decision, the PTC will also take into consideration other factors, such as the prevailing economic conditions, affordability and the financial performance of the public transport operators.&nbsp; Only after examining all these factors will the PTC decide on whether to grant an increase and the quantum of the increase.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to Mdm Ho's question on the guidelines on affordability, I would like to&nbsp;inform her that the new mechanism requires the PTC to take into account the affordability of public transport to the average public transport user. Affordability will be monitored using the percentage of household income spent on public transport by a typical family.&nbsp; This figure will be tracked on an annual basis using fare and wage movements, and validated<p align=left>Column: 579<p> against the Household Expenditure Survey conducted by the Department of Statistics once every&nbsp;five years.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this will ensure that public transport will remain affordable to the vast majority of the population, I agree with Mdm Ho that any increase, no matter how small, will still affect the needy and the low-income earners.&nbsp; In fact, they face some difficulty coping with any increase in the cost of living. This would include not just transport costs, but also basic necessities like food, housing and utilities. But we cannot hold back fare increases that are justified, just as we cannot hold back increases in food or utilities prices if the global price of fuel and food goes up. The Government will continue to help this group through the many financial assistance schemes provided by MCYS, the CDCs, the VWOs, as well as the newly established ComCare Fund.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the PTC is still assessing the PTOs' applications and will take all relevant factors into consideration before coming to a decision.&nbsp; As this is a tedious process involving careful scrutiny of the operators' applications and justifications, the PTC will take at least&nbsp;four weeks to complete its review and is expected to announce its decision in June.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, our public transport companies appear to have made unfortunate timing and elevated it to an art form, because they have announced their application at a time when they also announced quite large profits.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;the question the public has in mind is: &nbsp;where our transport companies are doing well, can they not use some of these profits to subsidise their operating cost?&nbsp; And is that something that the Public Transport Council will bear in mind?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B> Sir, I do not think any public company is in the business of subsidising consumers.&nbsp; But what they are required to do is to make sure that measures are in place to ensure that they are efficient, they are providing a good level of services and that the fares that they are charging are reasonable.&nbsp; In fact, the fares in Singapore have been very reasonable.&nbsp; For example, the fares over the past 17 years have gone up by no more than 30-odd per cent, whereas labour costs have gone up by more than 130%.&nbsp; So I think the transport operators have been making all kinds of efforts to ensure that they are efficient and to continue to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, PTC will definitely be looking at the profitability of the operators, because that is part of the condition that is included in the Report set out by the Fare Review Committee earlier this year.&nbsp;

Can I ask the Minister whether the viability of the transport operators&nbsp;is under threat if they do not get the price increase that they are asking for this time, taking into consideration the fact that the transport operators have in fact been having bigger and bigger profits every year after the last price increase in 2002?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, one of the reasons which the transport operators have given recently for their request for price increase is that the price of oil has been going up.&nbsp; In view of the fact that the world price of oil has come down since last week&nbsp; -&nbsp; it is now about US$48 per barrel, coming down from its peak&nbsp; -&nbsp; is this argument valid any more?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In terms of the price of fuel, one should not look at the price of fuel last week compared to this week.&nbsp; One should look at the price of fuel at the time of the last increase, which was in 2002, when I think the price of fuel was probably in the region of US$20.&nbsp;

&nbsp;ElderShield requires claimants to pay for the medical assessment.&nbsp; This is another common industry feature to cut out frivolous claims.&nbsp; As it is important to have objective criteria to ensure fairness and consistency in the claims process, ElderShield claimants need an independent assessment from a doctor who is trained to assess disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Is there any particular reason why the number is so small?&nbsp; Is there some way in which this policy, before it is ultimately reviewed in the year 2007, can&nbsp;be made more effective from now up to the period of review?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister explained that three months is the standard policy in the insurance industry for processing of claims and it is&nbsp;also a standard policy that the claimant has to pay for the fee for certification by the doctor.&nbsp; That may be so for the private sector insurance industry.&nbsp; But for a national scheme or&nbsp;public scheme, used by those who cannot afford&nbsp;the private scheme, the rules should be made more flexible.&nbsp; Therefore, can the three months' processing time be reduced?&nbsp; Also, can the insurance company or the plan absorb the certification fee by the doctor?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The problem is this.&nbsp; This is a long-term disability insurance scheme and it started off by taking in only people <p align=left>Column: 585<p>without pre-existing disabilities. So the number of successful claims will build up.&nbsp; Once you are disabled,&nbsp;you add to&nbsp;the number cumulatively.&nbsp; Those who were already disabled at the time of the launch of the scheme were automatically excluded.&nbsp; So I am not surprised that the numbers will be small at the initial stage.&nbsp; But whether this is actuarially too small or too big, I will be able to make a better judgement&nbsp;after I have gone into the details of the review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the question on the three months' claim process and also the assessment fee, as I said, these are fairly standard industry procedures.&nbsp; I have looked at other similar insurance plans overseas - Japan, US, UK -&nbsp;they set an even longer claim period, some as long as six months.&nbsp; So I thought three months seem reasonable, but we will certainly take the comments into account when we review this.&nbsp; As to whether the fee is affordable, it is only $25, which I think ought to be fairly affordable for most claimants, if not all.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that, if&nbsp;a person - I am just talking about ElderShield - is unable to perform the three activities of daily living of washing/dressing, feeding, toileting, and has problems of mobility and transferring even with the aid of special equipment and always&nbsp;requiring the physical assistance of another person throughout the entire activity, it would be unlikely for him&nbsp;to get better with time, and, in fact, he would be likely to get worse.&nbsp; Therefore, is it not inhumane to withdraw the ElderShield payout after five years irrespectively, and is the $300 per month too meagre an amount for survival for such a person?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I have read from the <I>Hansard</I> a similar debate in this House between Dr Neo and my predecessor precisely on these two points.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 586<p>suppose I could rehash, repeat or re-broadcast Minister Lim Hng Kiang's reply.&nbsp; But let me take a second look at it again.&nbsp; It is clearly on my workplan for next year - the&nbsp;review of ElderShield.&nbsp; I took my time on this because partly I felt that the MediShield reform is much more urgent.&nbsp; And, really, I am already losing sleep over MediShield, and I cannot afford to lose further sleep over ElderShield.&nbsp; It is something that I will study carefully next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember Minister Lim Hng Kiang's reply to both questions, which is, not in so many words, that "there is no free lunch".&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want better payouts,&nbsp;the premiums will be larger.&nbsp; If you want less premiums, then the payouts will have to be shrunk.&nbsp; Anyway, let us take a look, now that we have two-and-a-half years of claim data and another 12 months, three-and-a-half years of claim data, we can&nbsp;better judge&nbsp;whether the policy has been over-priced, in which case it will be&nbsp;a nice problem, as it is a matter of extending the benefits or reducing the premium.&nbsp; If the review were to come to a conclusion that the premiums are&nbsp;not enough,&nbsp;we will have a&nbsp;bigger problem.&nbsp; But I think I will rather keep my options open at this stage.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:PRIVATE CLINICS--><p align=left>Column: 586<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>PRIVATE CLINICS</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Publication of fees--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Publication of fees)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> asked the Minister for Health what is the Ministry's policy on private clinics publicising their fees to the public considering that the Ministry is now encouraging public sector hospitals to be more transparent by publicising their fees as part of the overall policy to contain healthcare costs.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;my Ministry encourages all healthcare institutions to be transparent with their charges.

To protect our young, we have in place a three-pronged approach based on enforcement of our laws against such crimes, public education and concerted industry self-regulation to help make our online environment safe for users.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on legal enforcement.&nbsp;Sir, there were&nbsp;eight reported cases of Internet-related sex offences involving victims under the age of 16 in 2004.&nbsp; The Police takes a serious view of every such offence.&nbsp; Where offences have been committed, they will investigate them thoroughly, apprehend the offenders and prosecute them.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as the Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs has just said a moment ago, we have tough laws against sex predators who prey on the young.&nbsp; For example, an offence of statutory rape under the Penal Code, involving a woman under 14 years of age, carries a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of&nbsp;eight years and a maximum of 20 years, with not less than 12 strokes of the cane. It is also an offence for any man to engage in sexual intercourse with a woman below 16 years of age, whether or not there was consent, except by way of marriage. The offender is liable for imprisonment of up to&nbsp;five years and a maximum fine of $10,000.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, additionally, the Children and Young Persons Act makes it an offence for any person to commit or abet the commission of or procure or attempt to procure the commission by any person of any obscene or indecent act with any child or young person under 16 years of age. If convicted, the offender is liable for imprisonment of up to&nbsp;two years or a<p align=left>Column: 595<p> maximum fine of $5,000, or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, imprisonment of up to&nbsp;four years or a maximum fine of $10,000, or to both.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on industry regulation.&nbsp;The Government recognises that legal enforcement alone is not enough.&nbsp; Therefore, through the Media Development Authority (MDA) and the National Internet Advisory Council (NIAC), the Government has been working actively with industry groups, such as the Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation (SiTF) and the local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to develop programmes to promote greater industry regulation.&nbsp; One result is that the Internet Service Providers&nbsp;now offer to subscribers Family Access Networks (FANs).&nbsp; These are networks&nbsp;that filter out undesirable websites on behalf of the subscribers. I strongly advise parents with young children to subscribe to such services so as to be able to ensure that their children do not gain access to undesirable websites.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February this year, a group of players in the IT and Internet industry&nbsp;launched the Internet Industry</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Association of Singapore (IIAS).&nbsp; Part of its mandate is to help and counsel children exposed to inappropriate material online and work with other community groups to explore ways to protect young users from online predators.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on public education. Parents, schools and the community also have an important role to play.&nbsp; They must instil the correct values in our young and promote safe practices online.&nbsp; To this end, the Cyber Wellness Task Force, set up by the National Internet Advisory Council, has embarked on public education programmes with strategic partners, such as the Ministry of Education, National Institute of Education, <p align=left>Column: 596<p>National Youth Council and&nbsp;National Library Board.&nbsp; In July this year, the National Institute of Education will launch the Group Endeavours in Service Learning Project whereby trainee teachers can mentor teenagers online.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MDA has also supported complementary public education efforts on Internet safety.&nbsp; &nbsp;It has provided funds to support the educational programmes of Parents Advisory Group for the Internet (PAGi) and Touch Community Services.&nbsp; Together, the&nbsp;two groups have reached&nbsp;out to over 140,000 parents and youths.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, however, the nature of the Internet, with a large number of websites and chatrooms, often hosting anonymous and transient exchanges, makes it impossible to completely insulate our young from encountering sex predators and other undesirable influences.&nbsp; &nbsp;Short of shutting down our connection to the Internet, we cannot completely insulate our young and youth from its dangers. But we can and have taken practical measures to try and equip our Internet users, particularly the young, with the know-how and the judgement to handle what they encounter in cyberspace.&nbsp; The Government, industry and community will continue to work together to provide a safer online environment for our young.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B>&nbsp; Sir, can the Minister inform the House whether they have a profile of these chatroom abusers, their typical tactics and also the pattern that they operate so that we could advise our educators, that is, our teachers, principals as well as parents, on how to deal with them?&nbsp; The second question is&nbsp;whether the Minister will work with the Ministry of Education to form a special squad, basically to protect our young children who are using the chatrooms.&nbsp; In fact, I went in&nbsp;just as a simple messenger, although it requires the person who owns this account to&nbsp;access<p align=left>Column: 597<p> it.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Senior Minister)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Commodity Derivatives Trader (CDT) Scheme aims to support an expanded role for Singapore as a commodity derivatives trading hub.&nbsp; The opportunities in this business are growing globally.&nbsp; In fact, they are growing very rapidly.&nbsp; To give Members a feel, the amount of over-the-counter (OTC) commodity derivatives contracts as at June last year reached US$1.27 billion, up 22% on a&nbsp;year earlier.&nbsp; The number of exchange-traded commodity derivative contracts reached 736 million globally last year, up 16% on the previous year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is the Asia Pacific centre for the price setting and trading of oil and rubber products.&nbsp; The CDT scheme aims to leverage on these existing strengths&nbsp;to develop Singapore further&nbsp;as a hub for trading, pricing and risk management for oil as well as other commodity products.&nbsp; By offering a concessionary tax rate of 5% on profits derived from trading commodity derivatives, the scheme seeks to grow a critical mass of market makers that focus on derivatives trading, in other words,&nbsp;paper trading.&nbsp; This will serve to increase the level of both physical and paper trading out of Singapore.&nbsp; The idea is basically to&nbsp;increase liquidity, and to thereby&nbsp;strengthen Singapore's role as a pricing hub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 606<p> Besides liquidity in the current products, the aim is to also&nbsp;encourage a broader range of commodity derivative products to be offered. &nbsp;In this respect, the CDT scheme supports both the OTC and exchange-traded commodity derivatives, including such things as commodity-based Exchange-Traded Funds and index futures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Risk management is another aspect of the market that the CDT scheme will help stimulate.&nbsp; The development of a liquid commodities market with a wide range of hedging instruments and products will help support risk management activities here.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:WALKING TRAILS IN RESERVOIRS AND NATIONAL PARKS--><p align=left>Column: 606<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The public needs to play&nbsp;its part too.&nbsp; In this regard, I am happy to say that&nbsp;many individuals and organisations are already helping NParks to monitor the health of the habitats. They conduct guided walks and educational talks, and patrol the areas. Visitors can also help by alerting NParks if they spot any defects or witness any unauthorised activities in the nature reserves.&nbsp; More importantly, visitors should do their part to safeguard our heritage for others' enjoyment by keeping the areas clean and tranquil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lee asked whether it would be possible to install closed circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at the major trails to deter improper uses of the facilities.&nbsp; CCTVs are more useful in confined areas where the monitoring staff can respond instantly to incidents.&nbsp; As the nature reserves are vast open areas, CCTVs may not be as effective.&nbsp; In any case, it will not be possible for us to monitor people's activities all the time.&nbsp; Ultimately, visitors, cyclists included, should exercise personal responsibility and common courtesy. For example, they should observe trail etiquette by keeping to designated paths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lee asked whether existing penalties for anti-social behaviour are sufficient deterrence and whether they are enforced.&nbsp; Sir, under the existing National Parks Regulations, enforcement action may be taken against persons for cycling on unauthorised tracks, fishing illegally and so on in the nature reserves.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column:608<p>Offenders may be fined up to $5,000 upon conviction.&nbsp; In 2004, a total of 148 people were fined for various offences committed in the reserves.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</B>:&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, in considering giving access of nature parks and other facilities to the public, whether the Ministry also looks into the issue of safety of access. For instance, it was recently reported that the access to the Tree-Top Walk via the Singapore Island Country Club is dangerous because there is no walkway for the public to access the Tree-Top Walk.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Swee Say</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the location of the Tree-Top Walk is such that it is in the middle of the nature reserve.&nbsp; The Member is correct that there is no direct&nbsp;access to the Tree-Top Walk, in the sense that you do not see a big&nbsp;road&nbsp;or path going direct to the Tree-Top Walk. The question is whether the current situation will put the safety of the public at risk.&nbsp; My own assessment is that I do not think so.&nbsp; If Members were to go to the Tree-Top Walk, they will realise that the way to get to the Tree-Top Walk is to walk&nbsp;along a road path right next to the New Course of the&nbsp;Singapore Island Country Club.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a typical day,&nbsp;maybe 100-150 players will use the road. In other words, the number of cars using that road is very limited.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;as golfers do not tee-off any time of the day, you can expect&nbsp;about 50-100 cars or so&nbsp;using&nbsp;that road mainly from 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock in the morning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have been to the Tree-Top Walk myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that the speed limit on the Island Country Club Road is actually 20-25 kph.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also full of humps.&nbsp; So even if the golfers&nbsp;were&nbsp;impatient and&nbsp;wanted to speed, it is not possible for&nbsp;them to speed because of the <p align=left>Column: 609<p>many&nbsp;humps on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, from my personal observation,&nbsp;the speed on that road is being observed at 20-25 kph.&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, I play golf there and&nbsp;I have noticed that&nbsp;all have&nbsp;to drive very slowly there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure the Member that while this concern for safety is a valid one,&nbsp;I do not think&nbsp;members of the public are being exposed to unnecessary risks.&nbsp; Of course, the question is whether&nbsp;there is any other alternative.&nbsp; One alternative will be for us to&nbsp;cut down the trees&nbsp;and build a road directly to the Tree-Top Walk.&nbsp; If we were to do that, then we will be destroying&nbsp;nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether&nbsp;golfers or members of the public, we will just have to learn to co-exist so that we can enjoy&nbsp;nature without risking each other.&nbsp; But more importantly, without risking&nbsp;nature.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he is also aware that in the nature reserves, particularly around&nbsp;the MacRitchie Reservoir trails, there are&nbsp;cyclists who are cycling when they are not authorised to cycle, as stated on&nbsp;the big signs out there?&nbsp; Because these trails are&nbsp;very heavily used by walkers and joggers, especially those people who are on their way to and from the Tree-Top Walk,&nbsp;these cyclists&nbsp;pose a danger,&nbsp;as&nbsp;they believe they are only doing trail cycling, and by their nature,&nbsp;sometimes, they go quite fast without due regard for pedestrains.&nbsp; But in the first place, they are not supposed to be there.&nbsp; My understanding is that there&nbsp;are&nbsp;very few NParks staff available. That is why&nbsp;the suggestion to use CCTVs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that kind of context, Sir, it is a very enclosed area and not a wide open space.&nbsp; Perhaps, we should still give it a thought.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Swee Say</B>:&nbsp; Sir, Dr Warren Lee is correct that cyclists are&nbsp;not allowed to use the hiking trail because that would pose a danger and inconvenience to the<p align=left>Column: 610<p> hikers.&nbsp;What NParks has done is to work very closely with the Singapore Amateur Cycling Association&nbsp;and the various cycling groups.&nbsp; In fact, according to&nbsp;the assessment of&nbsp;NParks, the situation has improved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few months, the Singapore Amateur Cycling Association and the various cycling groups have come together to promote&nbsp; greater awareness among their members by encouraging&nbsp;them not to go on to&nbsp;the hiking trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who want to&nbsp;do cycling should&nbsp;use the biking trail.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do have&nbsp;biking trails along&nbsp;the perimeters of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are extending&nbsp;these biking trails so that hopefully, over time, there will be&nbsp;more biking trails for the bikers. The bottomline is&nbsp;that&nbsp; the bikers&nbsp;should not go&nbsp;on the hiking trail and the hikers&nbsp;should not go&nbsp;on the biking trail.&nbsp; As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;they keep away from&nbsp;each other, things will be all right.&nbsp; Last year, of the about 150 offences, none of them were due to illegal cycling in our nature reserves.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;the cyclists indeed have been cooperating.&nbsp;</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:COUNSELLING SERVICES FOR MEN IN NEED OF HELP--><p align=left>Column: 610<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>COUNSELLING SERVICES FOR MEN IN NEED OF HELP</span></B></div><BR>							<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Sir, Mr Peter Ho has been appointed Permanent Secretary for National Security and Intelligence Coordination to oversee the National Security Coordination Secretariat.&nbsp; Colonel Soh Poh Theen is the Director for the National Security Coordination Centre and Mr Yeong Gah Hou is the Director for the Joint Counter Terrorism Centre.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure effective strategic planning, policy development and intelligence coordination across Government, Mr Peter Ho chairs the National Security Coordinating Committee and the Intelligence Coordinating Committee.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence, I chair the Ministerial level Security Policy Review Committee, which sets the strategic policy direction for national security issues in Singapore.&nbsp; All three committees - the two PS-level <p align=left>Column: 616<p>committees and the Ministerial Committee - have met on a regular basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key pillars of the Strategic Framework</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Strategic Framework for Singapore's National Security is built on two pillars.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Strength through Coordination.&nbsp; We have adopted a "Whole of Government" approach in the fight against terror aimed at achieving greater coordination among our Government agencies and Ministries.&nbsp; Since the threat of transnational terrorism cuts across departmental divides, no single agency alone can tackle this problem.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have forged tighter linkages among the various Government agencies to achieve greater effectiveness.&nbsp; Coordination gives us the strength to deal with the threat of transnational terrorism in a way that no single agency can tackle alone.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second pillar is Reach through Cooperation.&nbsp; Since transnational terrorism respects no territorial boundaries, we have worked with our overseas partners to extend our security network to better pre-empt any threats and to protect Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain a little bit about how these two pillars have been implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Strength through Coordination.&nbsp; Sir, stronger collaboration across Ministries and agencies in Singapore is key, and a system that links the critical nodes and coordinates their efforts has proven to be effective.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already, there are some visible results.&nbsp; A number of task forces have conducted comprehensive reviews and helped plug capability gaps in areas as diverse as maritime security, aviation security, land transport security, critical infrastructure protection and building up defences <p align=left>Column: 617<p>against Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives (CBRE) threats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me briefly summarise some of the work that has been done in these areas.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of maritime security, for example, a licensing scheme for regional ferry operators has been put in place since 1st January 2005 to regulate the movement and enhance security on board these regional ferries.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also started deploying Sea Marshals on board selected vessels since March 2005.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For aviation security, an in-line baggage screening system has been set up at Changi Airport to systematically examine every piece of luggage that is checked in.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of public transport security, security guards have been deployed, CCTV systems are being upgraded and police patrols have been initiated to keep our MRT system secure.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of critical infrastructure protection, among other things, we have reviewed the security of our energy grid and info-communications infrastructure.&nbsp; We have identified key energy facilities that should be further hardened and we have launched an Info-Comm Security Masterplan that will comprehensively raise Singapore's cyber security standards over the next three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;And in building up our defences against CBRE threats, vehicles transporting hazardous material have been fitted with transponders to monitor and control their movement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key message of achieving Strength through Coordination has been reinforced in a number of concrete ways.&nbsp; To help build bridges across our various Ministries and agencies, NSCS organised an inaugural National Security Course in <p align=left>Column: 618<p>February this year.&nbsp; The course was well attended by senior officers from across the different Ministries and agencies involved in the work of national security.&nbsp; The course helped to forge a common vision of Singapore's national security, enhanced understanding of each other's professional expertise and established a bond amongst senior security practitioners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, in all our efforts, we have kept a close watch on the prevailing threat situation and taken a risk mitigation approach (ie, balancing the necessary security measures against the economic costs incurred) to ensure that resources are prudently used.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also been careful not to over-regulate or be too restrictive in the implementation of security measures, as we understand the impact this would have on business efficiency and on the lives of Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Reach through cooperation<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, transnational terrorism respects no national borders, and Singapore must therefore look beyond coordination amongst Government agencies to achieve greater reach through cooperation with like-minded states and with international organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In pushing the agenda for greater security, Singapore has been a strong advocate of regional and international cooperation.&nbsp; We realise that the centre of gravity to the threat of terrorism lies outside Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperation in the war on terror must therefore extend beyond the borders of Singapore, principally in the sharing of intelligence and pooling of resources.&nbsp; Given the interconnectedness of countries today, cooperation is a fundamental pre-requisite in areas such as maritime security, aviation security, cyber security and border control, and in building up defences against CBRE threats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 619<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant progress has been achieved in several areas.&nbsp; I would mention just one area, maritime security, to illustrate what has been achieved.&nbsp; In maritime security, Singapore has been working closely with Indonesia, Malaysia and other key stakeholders as well as with the International Maritime Organisation to safeguard the Malacca and the Singapore Straits, which are critical international waterways.&nbsp;&nbsp;All three littoral states commenced coordinated patrols of the Straits in July 2004.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closer home, the Maritime and Port Authority worked closely with the shipping community and with owners of port facilities to successfully implement the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, which seeks to enhance the general security of merchant vessels and port facilities.&nbsp; Singapore vessels and ports were fully compliant with the code before the July 2004 deadline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At the regional level, Singapore has been chosen to host an Information Sharing Centre under a regional agreement to combat piracy.&nbsp; This will help reinforce Singapore's position as an important node in regional cooperative efforts to enhance maritime security.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has also worked closely with the US to implement several maritime security programmes such as the Container Security Initiative, the Radiation Detection Initiative and the Proliferation Security Initiative.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collectively, these programmes seek to prevent the illegal transfer&nbsp; and movement of dangerous material, and the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Singapore also encourages academic discussions and forums to enable think-<p align=left>Column: 620<p>tanks, academic institutions and key stakeholders to exchange views and take a more pro-active approach to a range of national security issues including maritime policies.&nbsp; For instance, our Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies has hosted and organised seminars with many terrorism experts from various international and renowned centres of excellence on national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these enable us to be connected and relevant to the leading edge thinking on security issues in the international community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Further tasks<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, although we have raised the baseline for security in all areas, more remains to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to coping with existing known threats, we should pay attention to potential events that could cause great disruption to Singapore, events such as a biological terrorist attack, a radiological incident or a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our recent experience with SARS and the tsunami disaster has demonstrated forcefully that strategic surprises or wild cards can have a devastating impact.&nbsp; We are therefore developing a Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning capability to help us anticipate and deal with shocks to our system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year, we have embarked on detailed studies to draw up a conceptual model and an operational framework to implement this capability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I should stress that we would need to be inventive, as ready solutions do not exist for many of the problems linked to transnational terrorism.&nbsp; We would need to spend some resources on research and development work to discover imaginative solutions to intractable problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has the potential to take the lead in several areas. For example, our maritime security agencies will be <p align=left>Column: 621<p>introducing a scheme shortly that would require all small craft operating within Singapore's territorial waters to carry a transponder.&nbsp; This low-cost device would help the security agencies keep track of the maritime traffic in our waters and be better able to discern threats.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is also interested in initiating a pilot project that would look into securing the entire supply chain involving Government agencies, port authorities, shipping lines and major suppliers from different countries.&nbsp; This will not be an easy task but like the other&nbsp;research and development projects we are</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>undertaking, we must put in the necessary effort and resources.&nbsp;If we are successful, we will be breaking new ground and we would be in a unique position to share new capabilities with other countries.&nbsp; In any case, our determination and resourcefulness will serve as yet another strong deterrent to terrorists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Need for continued vigilance<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have highlighted the key security initiatives we have implemented since the Strategic Framework came into force in July 2004 and some of the projects we will undertake over the next year or two.&nbsp; I am confident we are taking the right steps and moving in the right direction in the fight against terrorism.&nbsp;But we need to be vigilant and sensitive to changes in the external environment and to their impact on the internal dynamics in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore remains a prime target for terrorists. Singapore strongly supports the US-led campaign against terror.&nbsp; We have taken robust steps to stamp out the Jemaah Islamiyah in Singapore.&nbsp; And we are a secular state that has successfully enabled different religious groups to co-exist and prosper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 622<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reality of the threat to Singapore is driven home by the continued persistence of the Al Qaeda movement worldwide and of the Jemaah Islamiyah network in the region.&nbsp;Dangerously, the Jemaah Islamiyah has continued to evolve and forge alliances with other groups in Indonesia and the Philippines.&nbsp; The secessionist problem in southern Thailand could also draw in terrorist organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Importantly, the resources and facilities available to recruit and train successive generations of terrorists have not been eliminated or destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality of the threat is also manifested in the arrests that we continue to make in Singapore.&nbsp;Just last month, Jahpar Osman, a Singaporean and a Jemaah Islamiyah member trained in bomb making and weapons handling, was detained under the Internal Security Act.&nbsp; Osman had been a member of the Jemaah Islamiyah since the mid-1990s and had undergone military training in Mindanao in the southern Philippines.&nbsp; He was also involved in plans to carry out terrorist attacks against Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have used these illustrations to make the point that the terrorist threat will be with us for some time to come.&nbsp; Singaporeans should not feel that the threat no longer exists.&nbsp; The terrorist threat is real and terrorists always seek the right opportunity, especially when our guard is lowered, to strike.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Importance of national resilience<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to spending considerable effort in implementing a total approach that emphasises coordination, cooperation and physical security measures, we should not lose our focus on strengthening national resilience.&nbsp; The key target of transnational terrorism is our social fabric which binds our society together.&nbsp;Terrorists aim to attack the hearts and minds of our citizens to split our society apart.&nbsp; We must counter this threat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 623<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past year, I have therefore been engaged in a series of programmes to reach out to various sectors of Singapore society to stress to them the importance of their role in helping to keep Singapore safe.&nbsp;I met with Government officials in August 2004, with grassroots leaders in October 2004, with young Singaporeans in November 2004, and with the business community in January this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim community in Singapore have, in particular, provided critical support to the Government's overall efforts.&nbsp; The arrests of Jemaah Islamiyah members in Singapore initially put the Muslim community in the spotlight.&nbsp; Fears over a racial or religious backlash did not materialise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the Muslim community came together to deal with the issue resolutely and participated actively in the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles to reach out to the other communities and help them understand the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been very encouraged by the response of the Muslim community in Singapore.&nbsp; As part of the series of dialogue sessions I have had with the various sectors of society, I met with the Muslim community last month.&nbsp; At that session, MUIS (the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore) presented a broad outline of its vision for the Singapore Muslim community and MUIS' plans to develop a unique Singapore Muslim Identity characterised by a progressive, adaptive and inclusive practice of Islamic religious life.&nbsp; This reinforces our vision for all religious groups to co-exist and prosper within a secular Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the key message I want to stress today is that since September 11, 2001, transnational terrorism has changed the world around us.&nbsp; The world has become more volatile and dangerous.&nbsp; It is<p align=left>Column: 624<p> reassuring that a recent survey by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts reported that most Singaporeans are confident that the Government is able to manage the terrorist threat.&nbsp; However, only about half of those surveyed know what to do if, in spite of all the measures we have taken, terrorists succeed in launching a strike against Singapore.&nbsp; This is worrying. In today's uncertain world, Singaporeans must make "security consciousness" a part of our way of life.&nbsp; If "security consciousness" does not become second nature to Singaporeans, we will, as a people, react badly, possibly disastrously, when terrorists succeed in launching a strike in Singapore despite all the preparations and precautions the Government has put in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To safeguard Singapore, Singaporeans have to be joint partners with the Government to defend our country and protect our way of life.&nbsp; The Government has implemented many systems and measures under the Strategic Framework to safeguard Singapore.&nbsp; But we cannot ensure our security if Singaporeans do not share in the task of protecting our society.&nbsp; Everyone - Members of Parliament, Government officials, the business sector, the media, the general public - has a role to play in being more proactive to look out for potential threats and work with the Government to react quickly and effectively in the aftermath of a terrorist incident if such an incident should take place in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude my statement by commending the efforts and thanking the officers of our security and intelligence agencies including the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Singapore Police Force, the Internal Security Department, the Singapore Civil Defence Force, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, the Ministry of Defence, the Singapore Armed Forces,<p align=left>Column: 625<p> and the Security and Intelligence Division for performing their duties admirably, maintaining high standards of operational readiness, and being vigilant to developments and potential threats in the region and within our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to convey my appreciation to the Members of this House. Through the difficult times we have experienced in recent years, Members have helped convey the messages and explain the Government's position on issues such as terrorism to the people. Members have also provided valuable feedback and have helped the Government make adjustments to policies. You understand the fine balance the Government needs to achieve between projecting deterrence and raising alarm among Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I urge all Singaporeans to continue to be vigilant. The danger posed by terrorism is a long-term threat that we have to learn to live with for many years to come.&nbsp; With the cooperation and support of Singaporeans, we will succeed in containing this threat and keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe and secure for many years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be happy to take Members' questions.&nbsp; Much obliged, Mr Speaker, Sir.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for a very detailed reply which contained very farsighted ideas.&nbsp; It will help make Singaporeans feel that much more secure.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two questions.&nbsp; The key words I heard from his speech are "coordination and cooperation".&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister to tell us whether we have been successful in also engaging Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in our efforts to contain transnational terrorism, as we will not be<p align=left>Column: 626<p> safe no matter how much we try to insulate ourselves or detain the JI dissidents or no matter how we patrol our maritime waters?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I also ask the Minister to please give us a sense of whether he is satisfied with the cooperation so far?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question relates to the survey.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister whether the survey has also taken into account differences in terms of the perceptions and attitudes of men and women, along gender lines, and in terms of, for instance, whether men are more aware of the practical steps to take in the event of a terrorist attack compared to women, and on the various questions asked?&nbsp; Because if the women, not having gone through National Service, might not share the same kind of security consciousness, perhaps more should be done in terms of courses or&nbsp;programmes to inculcate a more rugged mentality among our women.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</B> Sir, I thank Ms Irene Ng for her questions.&nbsp; First, regarding cooperation with Indonesia and Thailand, this is progressing.&nbsp; Indonesia particularly, of course, is a country nearest to us.&nbsp; We also know that although we have dismantled the Jemaah Islamiyah network in Singapore, several of its operatives have fled from Singapore and are probably hiding in the region, possibly in Indonesia.&nbsp; Members will also know or hear about the bomb blasts which had taken place in Indonesia, in Bali, at the Marriott Hotel and outside the Australian Embassy.&nbsp; So the threat is there.&nbsp; The Indonesian authorities, as expressed by President Yudhoyono, are determined to stamp out terrorism. We work with them.&nbsp; We exchange intelligence.&nbsp; We cooperate together.&nbsp; On occasions, this cooperation has enabled us to arrest members of the Jemaah Islamiyah in Indonesia and bring them back.&nbsp; Cooperation could be improved, and this is an on-going area.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 627<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On maritime security, Indonesia and Malaysia are now working with Singapore to have coordinated patrols to secure the Straits of Malacca.&nbsp; The Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister has also said that we should look into the possibility of joint patrols.&nbsp; This is an area which we should look into.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooperation is never easy.&nbsp; We will have to work&nbsp;at it, always taking into account that, for example, in securing the Straits of Malacca, we have to be conscious that any measures or patrols which we are undertaking do not infringe on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the littoral states.&nbsp; So we have to work out all of these rules and regulations and continue to keep a high alert to fight against terror which threatens everyone, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to Thailand, we exchange intelligence, and we work together.&nbsp; The secessionist problem in southern Thailand worries us.&nbsp; Where, for example, we need to work with them on having air marshals on planes between Singapore and Thailand, we have done so.&nbsp; But we could work better.&nbsp; We continue to press this issue.&nbsp; I think the Thai government is now much more conscious about the possibility of terrorism.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>The danger is that the incidents arising from the secession in southern Thailand could lead beyond the three southern Thai provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani into other population centres, including holiday resorts like Phuket, and the capital,&nbsp;Bangkok. Then it would be a very serious situation.&nbsp; But it is an area which we will work with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the survey results and whether there is a difference in attitude or consciousness between men and women on the need for security, Sir, the answer is "yes".&nbsp; In general, men are much more <p align=left>Column: 628<p>conscious about the need for security, and the reason is a very simple one.&nbsp; All our young men have gone through National Service.&nbsp; In these two years of National Service, they are brought upfront directly face to face with the issue on how to defend Singapore and&nbsp;protect our society.&nbsp; The&nbsp;two or 2&nbsp;1/2 years of National Service imprints an indelible mark on all our men in Singapore.&nbsp; They know that Singapore is vulnerable.&nbsp; They know that no one can protect Singapore except ourselves.

That is why I met with the teachers and students from junior colleges last year to impress on them that this is not a problem for their parents.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is a problem&nbsp;which they will face when they grow up, to be prepared.&nbsp; It is not going to go away, and it is a threat which all of us, adults&nbsp;and children, would have to be prepared to live with for many years.&nbsp; We can also do so at community functions, and it is where Members of Parliament can play a major role in organising their grassroots leaders, participating in events which bring home to Singaporeans the need to be aware of the threats and how they can help in order to mitigate these threats and, very important, that one day, when there is a terrorist attack in Singapore, that would be&nbsp;the real test.&nbsp;Can we respond as a people quickly, efficiently, effectively and get over it?&nbsp; Then we will succeed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;a terrorist attack in Singapore does not mean the end of the world.&nbsp; That is something which we have to bear in mind.&nbsp; If there is an attack, we will get over it, Singapore will go on.&nbsp; Life does not end.&nbsp; So long as we have that confidence, no threat can destroy Singapore.&nbsp; But we must make preparations.&nbsp; That is what&nbsp;NSCS, together with all our security&nbsp;agencies, has been doing all of these years.&nbsp; Also, organisations, like&nbsp;SCDF and the Police, will be organising events in constituencies in order to bring home to Singaporeans the need for them to take part in ensuring our National Security and what they can do.&nbsp; The Ministry of Home Affairs has, for example, started this campaign to have&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 630<p>"Be Ready" bags&nbsp;which contain a radio, torchlight and some basic medical aids.&nbsp;I think this is a very good move.&nbsp; We should make those "Be Ready" bags&nbsp;available to every household in Singapore.&nbsp; It is a visible sign of the need to protect ourselves, not by the Government, but by every Singaporean family.&nbsp;I hope that when the Ministry of Home Affairs,&nbsp;SCDF,&nbsp;Police and&nbsp;SAF launch these campaigns, Members will participate fully and, in that way, we will always be sure that Singaporeans will remain vigilant and that, as I said, if something does happen, we will not panic.&nbsp; But we will be able to handle the incident in a way which does credit to Singapore as we have done with SARS.&nbsp; The test of our people comes not in good times when everything is going on well.&nbsp; The test of our people comes in difficult times when you are faced with a challenge.&nbsp; Do you fold up and give up?&nbsp; Do you rise up to the occasion, face the challenge squarely, overcome it and then move on?&nbsp;

I do not think that we should be complacent or we should hide the fact.&nbsp; If we do not keep up our guard, if we let our guard down, the terrorists will strike, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this year or next<p align=left>Column: 631<p> year,&nbsp;but they will strike one of these days.&nbsp; And I do not see this situation improving over the next two or three years.&nbsp; This is a long-term threat.&nbsp; You are faced with an enemy which is fighting you on illogical grounds, who are prepared to go on, use extreme tactics and methods which cause catastrophic damage, kill many people in order to get the outcome which they want.&nbsp; They will not be deterred by a few arrests.&nbsp; A new generation of terrorists&nbsp;is being nurtured, groomed and indoctrinated all the time.&nbsp; And the threat will be with us for many years.&nbsp; So whether it is this year or two or three years down the road, the threat will be there.&nbsp; With the cooperation of the countries around us, I think we can manage to contain this threat.&nbsp; But we must work at it.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, I think that with all the incidents that had happened, more countries, both in the region and around the world,&nbsp;are now conscious of the need to contain the threat of transnational terrorism.&nbsp; Singapore is playing its part.&nbsp; We work with the region to manage this threat.&nbsp; But for the time being, I cannot say that there is a point, whether this year, next year or a few years after that, when we can say that the threat is over.&nbsp; That is the reality.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> I read some assessments in the US and some other commentators who said that, with the arrest of&nbsp; the No. 3 in the Al Qaeda organisation, and with the US engagement in the global security situation, there were some assessments that the security threat has somewhat lessened.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is DPM's view on that and how does that relate to Singapore?&nbsp; I am not saying that the threat is not real.&nbsp; But my question is: if it is real, how real is it and to what degree&nbsp;should we be ready for it?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam--> <p align=left>Column: 632<p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</B> Sir, with the arrests that had taken place, both in the US and around the world&nbsp;in various countries, including&nbsp;Singapore and&nbsp;Malaysia, there is no doubt that a considerable part of the leadership of the Al Qaeda and&nbsp;Jemaah Islamiyah has been disrupted.&nbsp; So the chain of command is not as tight as it was before.&nbsp; But that does not mean that the threat has lessened.&nbsp; But what has happened now, in fact, is that it could have evolved into an even more dangerous version.&nbsp; Without the tight control from the top now, the Al Qaeda and&nbsp;Jemaah Islamiyah&nbsp;are splintering into a number of groups, each of which has its own agenda and each of which may carry out bombings and&nbsp;killings on an indiscriminate basis because there is no one to control them.&nbsp; Is this more dangerous than before?&nbsp; That is a matter of debate.&nbsp; Both are dangerous.&nbsp; But the threat is as real today as it was previously.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As to whether the threat is real or not, as I said, and I cannot say it more often, if you let down your guard and assume that the worst is over, you do so at your own peril.&nbsp; I do not think&nbsp;that is a wise thing to do.&nbsp; You must be&nbsp;on your guard all the time.&nbsp; A country, like Singapore, which is an international hub, financial hub, tourism hub, air hub, shipping hub, runs on confidence -&nbsp;confidence of international investors, businessmen, travellers and confidence of our own people&nbsp;that Singapore is a secure place, that parents can send their children to school, knowing that their children will come back safely in the afternoon.&nbsp; If we cannot provide that security, then there is no Singapore.&nbsp; If you look at Iraq, there is no security.&nbsp; And the fundamental responsibility of every government is to make sure that its people are safe and can live their lives safely.&nbsp; This is what the Government is going to do.&nbsp; Whether you are in the ruling party or in the Opposition,<p align=left>Column: 633<p> this is your responsibility to Singapore.&nbsp; You have a choice.&nbsp; You can either say that it is all over,&nbsp;you do not need any of these difficult measures&nbsp;unless an incident happens. Or better do everything that you can to prevent an incident happening in Singapore and prepare ourselves&nbsp;so that if one should happen, there is no panic.&nbsp; But we will be able to take it in our stride.&nbsp; That is the way for Singapore, not only to survive, but to progress and&nbsp;prosper.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> I wish to clarify that I am not saying that the Government should not be responsible for security.&nbsp; I am not questioning whether there is&nbsp;a need to safeguard ourselves,&nbsp;in terms of having security measures.&nbsp; My question is: to what extent we should have them and whether or not we should over-emphasise and dwell over that issue of security and to what extent would it also make us less confident and affect the confidence of the investors in the future?</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Transnational terrorism is a most immediate and significant threat to all civilised societies today.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we know all the measures which we have taken are difficult.&nbsp; But they are necessary.&nbsp; And, in fact, rather than panicking Singaporeans and foreigners, they are a key asset of Singapore.&nbsp; Many companies now base their operations in Singapore because their executives feel that Singapore is safe, that their operations and their plants will not be bombed, that their managers and expatriates can live in Singapore safely, send their children to schools in Singapore and not worry about having a bomb.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as its title implies, this Bill collates a number of amendments, mainly technical in nature, to several Acts.&nbsp; Let me highlight the key ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments due to implementation of Digital Transcription System (clauses 2, 3 and 11)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have some amendments to remove statutory requirements for evidence and proceedings to be recorded in writing.&nbsp; This will pave the way for the digital audio recording of evidence, which has several advantages.&nbsp; One key advantage is that the trial judge will need no longer record the evidence in longhand. This will free him up to concentrate on the evidence as given by the witness, and&nbsp;allows him to make his own brief notes at key points of the case.&nbsp; Trials can then move at a swifter pace, possibly resulting in savings in time and costs to the parties and witnesses.&nbsp; Secondly, if there is a dispute as to what the witness had said previously, the digital audio recording can be played back immediately to verify what the witness had said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect this innovation, clause 11 amends the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to delete reference to a shorthand transcript as "shorthand" will no longer be used in court.&nbsp; With the proposed <p align=left>Column: 636<p>implementation of a Digital Transcription System later this year, all open court proceedings in the Supreme Court will be digitally recorded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar vein, clauses 2 and 3 amend the provisions in the Bankruptcy Act and the Companies Act which require the court to reduce evidence to writing to reflect a manner of recording evidence which is technologically neutral to facilitate the use of new technologies.&nbsp; This will accommodate the Digital Transcription System.&nbsp; Currently, both statutes require the court to reduce the evidence to writing, read it over to the person examined, and require that person to sign the evidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments due to operation of Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005 (clauses 6 and 10)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next set of amendments is necessitated by the advent of a new corporate vehicle, the limited liability partnership (LLP), introduced by the Limited Liability Partnerships Act earlier this year.&nbsp; LLPs are corporate entities that can <p align=left>Column: 637<p>acquire and hold property.&nbsp; Under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act, an existing company can convert into a LLP.&nbsp; Upon conversion, all movable and immovable properties vested in the company will automatically be transferred to and vest in the LLP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LLP was not in existence when the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act and the Residential Property Act were enacted.&nbsp; As such, there are no references to LLPs in both Acts, whilst companies operate as housing developers under the Housing Developers Act and hold residential properties under the Residential Property Act. &nbsp;Therefore, consequential amendments are necessary to allow LLPs to acquire and hold residential property in Singapore under the Residential Property Act and to be housing developers under the Housing Developers Act.&nbsp; These amendments introduce provisions that mirror existing ones that apply to companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments do not, in substance, impact the existing framework of these two Acts.&nbsp; For example, under the Residential Property Act, where a company converts to a LLP, any approvals previously granted under the Residential Property Act to the company to hold and acquire residential property will continue to be valid as if it were granted to the new LLP.&nbsp; These amendments make clear that there is no need for a fresh application, and help companies that wish to convert to LLPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Repeal of the Government Hospitals Act (clause 4)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government Hospitals Act was introduced in 1960 to empower the Minister to prescribe fees and make disbursements in respect of Government hospitals.&nbsp; With the restructuring of the last two Government hospitals in 2000, the Act is obsolete and is no longer relevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, therefore, repeals the Government Hospitals Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Police Force Act 2004 (clause 9)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 9 amends the Police Force Act 2004 to allow Internal Security Department (ISD) officers who are performing investigation duties, to be designated by the Minister as Intelligence Officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 also amends the same Act to allow Intelligence Officers to exercise the full powers of police officers.&nbsp; Currently, ISD officers who do investigation work are conferred only police</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>powers of <p align=left>Column: 638<p>investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code, the Internal Security Act and seven other statutes which are prescribed by the Minister and gazetted. This arrangement arose as a result of the conversion of Senior Police Officers working in ISD, to the Intelligence Service in 2001. This made it necessary to specially vest police powers in such officers, who had previously exercised them as Senior Police Officers working in ISD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, after operating this arrangement for a few years now, it is felt that it is necessary to extend the designated police powers beyond these statutes. Given the nature of security investigations, and the need for confidentiality as well as timely action, operational effectiveness will be hampered if ISD officers are unable to investigate offences falling outside these statutes and have to refer them to other law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Miscellaneous amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I would like to take the House briefly through the remaining key provisions of the Bill which are to facilitate better administration of the Acts in question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Government Proceedings Act (clause 5)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, clause 5 makes technical amendments to the Government Proceedings Act to clarify, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Magistrate's Court has jurisdiction, in accordance with the Subordinate Courts Act to hear civil proceedings by and against the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Medicines Act (clause 7)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clause 7 makes a technical amendment to section 20(5) of the Medicines Act to apply the penalty provided in that provision to an offence <p align=left>Column: 639<p>under section 20(3A) of the Act. The offence under section 20(3A) was inserted in the Medicines Act in 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Planning Act (clause 8)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, clause 8 amends the Planning Act to allow CISCO officers to continue to be authorised to carry out specific enforcement functions such as site inspections and execution of works for enforcement. The clause also amends the same Act to allow the competent authority or authorised persons to bring along assistants and workmen with them when they enter premises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this amendment is necessitated by the corporatisation of the Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation (CISCO) which will take effect very soon. Currently, the Planning Act only empowers the competent authority to authorise public officers or officers from statutory boards to perform the functions I had earlier mentioned. These amendments will therefore make it possible for CISCO officers to continue performing their current enforcement functions under the Planning Act, notwithstanding CISCO's corporatisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

The third and last group of amendments consists of miscellaneous amendments ranging from abolishing obsolete fees connected with voter registration to conferring powers of composition on the Returning Officer or officials in the Elections Department.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will cover each one of them in turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Nomination procedures</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the purpose of any parliamentary elections is to enable the electorate to cast votes to select representatives to Parliament from the various candidates who come forward.&nbsp; However, the best and most suitable individual cannot be elected if he or she does not successfully complete the nomination process.&nbsp; The process by which a person is nominated is therefore as important as the final act of casting a vote.&nbsp; While our nomination process must continue to ensure that only responsible and serious candidates can gain access, the process can afford to be simplified to reduce the risk of aspiring individuals failing to be nominated due to formal errors or non-compliance with procedures.&nbsp; Deserving candidates should not be disqualified from standing because of minor technicalities.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our nomination proceedings today centre heavily on&nbsp;four sets of documents:&nbsp; the nomination paper, a Statutory Declaration as to qualifications, a political <p align=left>Column: 642<p>donations certificate and the relevant Certificate for a Group Representation Constituency (GRC).&nbsp; These documents have to be submitted to the Returning Officer, in a certain manner following certain formalities and within the prescribed time.&nbsp; Nominees or candidates with incomplete or incorrect documents may find their nomination rejected or objected to successfully by their opponents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In practice, the most common errors in nomination papers are wrong or incorrect register serial numbers of the proposer, seconder or the assentors.&nbsp; To reduce the risk of such errors invalidating nominations, the Government has decided to remove the requirement for register serial numbers in the nomination paper.&nbsp; The nominee and his proposer, seconder and assentors may be identified in the nomination paper by their NRIC numbers.&nbsp; You can see this change in clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill as they amend sections 27 and 27B respectively.&nbsp; The form of the nomination paper will be revised after this Bill is enacted.&nbsp; The new form will also have space for up to&nbsp;eight assentors, instead of the six.&nbsp; The nominees can therefore help themselves by obtaining a higher number of signatories just in case some of them are invalidated on account of errors.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will allow the nominees a margin of error of up to&nbsp;four, ie, an increase&nbsp;of two. &nbsp;However, these changes do not do away with the current legal requirement that every nominee must secure constituent support for his nomination.&nbsp; The proposer, seconder and assentors must all still be electors registered in the constituency for which the nominee is seeking election.&nbsp; To facilitate the checking of the electoral status of these signatories in nomination papers filed by their opponents, the Returning Officer will make available personal computer (PC) facilities loaded with the database of the registers of electors at every Nomination Centre for their use.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p align=left>Column: 643<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clauses 5 and 6 amend sections 27 and 27B by merging the nomination paper with the statutory declaration as to qualifications to stand for election.&nbsp; This will reduce the number of papers to be filed with the Returning Officer on nomination day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the manner in which nomination papers are to be delivered to the Returning Officer is also changed.&nbsp; Clause 7 amends section 29 to require nominees to be present at the Nomination Centre in person and accompanied by their proposer, seconder and at least&nbsp;four of their assentors.&nbsp; Besides facilitating corrections of any particulars in the nomination paper, this requirement will also prevent any insertion of particulars or forging of signatures of any registered elector in nomination papers without the elector's knowledge.&nbsp; As our present law already requires nominations to be made by the nominees in person, and accompanied by their proposer and seconder, it should not be difficult for the nominees to comply with the additional requirement of having their assentors to be present during nomination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there is little room under the&nbsp;law for some minor errors in nomination papers.&nbsp; Defects in a nomination paper that are potentially rectifiable can be overlooked since they will not invalidate the nomination.&nbsp; Hence, inaccurate names or misnomers, inaccurate descriptions of persons, or inaccurate descriptions of places can be overlooked where despite these inaccuracies or mistakes, the person or place is still identifiable.&nbsp; That is the position under section 103 of the Parliamentary Elections Act.&nbsp; However, blanks and errors in numbers are fatal errors.&nbsp; That is, these cannot be rectified and a nomination paper with any such defect has to be rejected or may be successfully objected to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 644<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two amendments are made to enlarge the scope for corrections to be made. Clause 8 introduces a new section 29A to allow a candidate or nominee to correct his nomination papers before 12 noon on the day of nomination.&nbsp; This facility does not, however, allow the candidate or nominee to substitute another person as candidate or nominee or as proposer, seconder or assentor.&nbsp; In addition to the facility to correct errors, the list&nbsp; of&nbsp;non-fatal errors in section 103 is expanded by clause 15 to provide that a nomination paper may still be accepted, and an objection may be disallowed, notwithstanding any error in numbers or any omission in the nomination paper in relation to the description or any particulars of the candidate or his proposer, seconder or any of his assentors, provided that the place or person can still be identified from the information contained in the nomination paper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these changes to allow candidates and nominees to correct their nomination papers prior to final determination if defects are discovered will help the aspiring candidate.&nbsp; However, the responsibility for filling in and verifying the accuracy of their papers remains with the nominees and their supporters. They have to ensure that their papers are in order. The Returning Officer still cannot overlook serious mistakes in nomination papers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, clause 13 amends section 33 to make the nomination process more efficient.&nbsp; Presently, nomination proceedings last from 11.00 am to 12.30 pm.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>Papers must be delivered to the Returning Officer no later than 12 noon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Withdrawals must also be filed before 12 noon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Objections may be lodged at any time from 11.00 am to 12.30 pm.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the recommendation that objections to any nomination for a constituency can only be lodged by persons authorised to be <p align=left>Column: 645<p>present at a Nomination Centre and seeking nomination for that same constituency, there will be no basis to prolong proceedings for the additional 30 minutes in instances where only one candidate or group of candidates in a GRC is nominated for a constituency.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, if at the close of nominations at 12 noon, only one candidate or group stands nominated for that constituency, the Returning Officer or his delegate may, under the amended section 33, proceed to declare that sole candidate or group duly elected as Members of Parliament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in 2001, the law was amended to invalidate multiple nominations.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it does not deal with the situation of multiple nominations of the same person in the same constituency.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can happen in the present environment where alliances have been formed between political parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, we now have the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) making up of the Singapore People's Party (SPP), the National Solidarity Party (NSP) and the PKMS, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual belonging to a political party, say, the SPP, may contest in a GRC concurrently as a member of the group from SPP and as a member of the group representing SDA.&nbsp; Who knows, there may be other alliances in future.&nbsp; Multiple nominations of this sort are therefore not hypothetical. To make it clear that this is not allowed, clause 12 amends section 32A to invalidate multiple nominations involving the same person in the same constituency.&nbsp; If, at the close of nomination for an election, a person is nominated to be a candidate in more than one constituency, or a person is nominated to be a candidate in the same constituency more than once, all his nominations will be void.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I now come to the amendments which seek to clarify certain provisions in the interests of certainty during nomination proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, <p align=left>Column: 646<p>owing to the&nbsp;shortage of suitable premises, we have always had a single school serving as the Nomination Centre for more than one constituency during a general election.&nbsp; Invariably, candidates of one constituency find objections being filed by candidates of a different constituency as they are all within the same Nomination Centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 29(4) of the Act, it is clear that only the candidate for a constituency and his/her proposer, seconder, assentors and one other person, if any, appointed, are entitled to examine the nomination papers of the opponent candidate for that same constituency.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have no entitlement to inspect the nomination papers of candidates of other constituencies even if the Nomination Centre is the same.&nbsp; Logically then, only those persons allowed to examine a nomination paper are entitled to lodge an objection to that nomination paper.&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid further confusion in proceedings on nomination day, clause 9 amends section 30 of the Act to make it clear that only candidates or groups of candidates contesting in a constituency, and their proposers, seconders, assentors and the one other person appointed by each candidate, and that only persons authorised to be present at the Nomination Centre can lodge objections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 10 repeals and re-enacts section 31 regarding persons entitled to be present at nomination proceedings. The provision now sets out a list of such persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I turn to withdrawal of candidature.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a candidate who wishes to withdraw his candidature must do so before 12 noon by a written notice signed by him or her.&nbsp; The law does not require the withdrawal to be done in person, although that has been insisted upon in practice.&nbsp; However, this is good practice.&nbsp; It is vital that the Returning Officer be satisfied that a withdrawal is genuine before he acts on it. For this<p align=left>Column: 647<p> reason, clause 11 amends section 32(1) to make it clear that withdrawal of candidature must be done in person.&nbsp;&nbsp; While technology allows for facsimile transmissions of notices of withdrawal, we consider this unacceptable, even if there is a dedicated line to receive such signed withdrawals.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not wish to encourage deliberate multiple nominations and last-minute withdrawals by candidates and parties, as this can only confuse matters.&nbsp; The electorate deserves the assurance that persons who present themselves for election to Parliament do so in a serious and responsible manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Returns respecting elections expenses</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to explain the changes to post-election reporting of election expenditure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the returns must contain details of election expenses incurred by the candidate and "all moneys, securities and other valuable considerations received by or promised to the election agent from or by any €¦ person for the purpose of expenses incurred or to be incurred on account or in respect of the management of the election €¦ whether it is received as contribution, loan deposit or otherwise", regardless of their origins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, promises are not something that will certainly be fulfilled.&nbsp; Now that we have a clear definition of "donation" in the Political Donations Act (PDA), we should do away with the impractical requirement for promises to be disclosed in the returns respecting election expenses and adopt a consistent language in our election law.&nbsp; Clause 14 amends section 74(1)(e) to dispense with the requirement to disclose promises made to candidates or their election agents as regards election expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Candidates and their election agents will in future need to disclose all <p align=left>Column: 648<p>donations as defined by the Political Donations Act&nbsp;that have been accepted by the candidate or his election agent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, under the Parliamentary Elections Act, the election agents are required to file with the Returning Officer a return on election expenses with their statutory declaration, together with another statutory declaration from their candidates, within 31 days after the election results are published.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Political Donations Act, the election agents, together with the candidates, must also file a post-election donation report and declaration with the Registrar of Political Donations&nbsp;within 31 days after the election results are published.&nbsp; The Political Donations Act forms only require an ordinary declaration from the candidates and their election agents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is administratively inconvenient for candidates and their election agents to make a statutory declaration each to accompany the returns&nbsp;with regard to&nbsp;election expenses.&nbsp; This is because the statutory declaration must be made before a Commissioner for Oaths or Justice of the Peace, and any statutory declaration has to be re-sworn or re-affirmed if the form, which is the subject of the declaration, has to be corrected in any way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Political Donations Act&nbsp;forms do not require a statutory declaration and will be filed with the same Government agency, ie, the Elections Department, there is no strong reason to insist on the returns to be accompanied by a statutory declaration.&nbsp; In any event, the punishment for making a false statutory declaration is the same as that for making a false ordinary declaration.&nbsp; Therefore, abolishing the need for a statutory declaration to accompany the returns with respect to&nbsp;election expenses will be consistent with<p align=left>Column: 649<p> the requirement for an ordinary declaration under the Political Donations Act&nbsp;forms.&nbsp; Clause 14 amends section 74(2) of the Parliamentary Elections Act to this effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Obsolete stamp fees</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now deal with the last group of miscellaneous amendments. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill concern provisions on objections and appeals as to the inclusion of a name in a register of electors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the amendments to the Stamp Duties Act that do away with adhesive stamps, the requirement in the Parliamentary Elections Act for an objection or appeal to bear a stamp of $1 is rendered obsolete.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 amends section 11 of the Act by abolishing the payment of a stamp fee of $1 for filing an objection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 12 for the same reason by abolishing the payment of a stamp fee of $5 to the Revising Officer for an appeal against any decision of the Registration Officer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Composition of offences</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the issue on composition of offences. The Returning Officer currently faces a constraint in dealing with technical breaches of the provisions of the Parliamentary Elections Act pertaining to offences such as the illegal display of posters.&nbsp; Offenders are either let off with a light warning or prosecuted.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter instance, criminal proceedings&nbsp;are taken only after the election and hence fail to deter repeated breaches during the election period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 16 inserts a new section 109 to allow the Returning Officer or an authorised officer of the Elections Department to compound appropriate offences.&nbsp; Composition of an offence is a procedure by which an agency that administers a <p align=left>Column: 650<p>written law gives a person who is reasonably suspected of committing an offence under that law (the alleged offender) the chance to avoid prosecution and conviction in court by paying a sum of money to the agency.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is done&nbsp;by many Government agencies. &nbsp;On payment of the sum of money by the alleged offender, the agency will not take or will discontinue any criminal proceedings against the alleged offender in respect of the offence and the alleged offender is taken not to have been convicted of the offence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offences will be those the Minister prescribes by regulations to be compoundable.&nbsp; For example, what&nbsp;we have in mind are offences such as displaying an election poster/banner without affixing to it an official stamp issued by the Returning Officer, damaging authorised posters/banners displayed by other candidates or using a loudspeaker on polling day. The composition sum will be half the amount of the maximum fine that is prescribed for the offence, or a sum not exceeding $500, whichever is lower.&nbsp; Composition will definitely not be a means for the Elections Department to generate revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elections Department will be drawing up internal mechanisms so that there will be clear and consistent criteria as to when composition can be offered, and in every case that meets these criteria, composition will be offered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with the amendments on nomination proceedings and post-election reporting of election expenditure, clause 17 amends the First Schedule by deleting Form 10 and Form 21.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposals will help candidates standing for elections because they simplify the processes and will cut red tape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><p align=left>Column: 651<p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</B> Sir, the amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act (Chapter 218) are supposed to simplify nomination procedures.&nbsp; As one who has taken part in seven general elections</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>and one By-Election, I can say that not all the amendments meet this aim, especially the one under clause 7 where section 29 of the principal Act is amended to require all the six signatories in support of the candidate to be present at the nomination centre on nomination day between the hours of 11.00 am and 12 noon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past 40 years, in all the 11 General Elections, the proposer, the seconder and the four assentors were never required to be present personally at the nomination centre on nomination day.&nbsp; That practice was time-tested and proven to be efficient.&nbsp; Why is there a&nbsp;sudden need to change?&nbsp; I think this new requirement is purely political.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with the simplification of nomination procedures.&nbsp; In fact, it is just the opposite.&nbsp; It puts more difficulties in the way of the Opposition parties and their candidates, especially their new candidates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The membership of Opposition parties does not cover the whole of Singapore.&nbsp; When an Opposition party wishes to file a candidate or candidates in a constituency where there are no party members there, the party will have to look for non-party members to sign the nomination form.&nbsp; Those people roped in to sign the nomination paper may be&nbsp;total strangers to the party.&nbsp; Especially for a new or unknown candidate, he usually finds it difficult&nbsp;to persuade six strangers to sign his nomination form.&nbsp;Because in Singapore, even up till today, the element of fear still exists.&nbsp; People are afraid to be seen to be helping the Opposition.&nbsp; In past elections, people who wanted to help the Opposition&nbsp;had&nbsp;only to put down their names and sign the election form.&nbsp; That <p align=left>Column: 652<p>act needed plenty of courage.&nbsp; Now, with the amendment, these Singaporeans have not only to append their names and sign the nomination form, but they are also called upon to attend personally at the nomination centre. That is really asking too much of those volunteers.&nbsp; Why do the proposers, seconders and assentors need to attend personally at the nomination centre?&nbsp; Is there evidence of any fraud?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last 40 years, I have not heard of reported cases of dishonest practice as far as the&nbsp;nomination forms are concerned.&nbsp; These days, one can make various applications to the authorities through the Internet.&nbsp; The application to take part in an election should also be one of such applications.&nbsp; Instead, the Government is seen to turn the clock backwards, completely ignorant of the advancement of technology, and opting for outdated practice by forcing applicants to attend personally at the nomination centre.&nbsp; Why make things so difficult, especially for the Opposition parties?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other difficulty of making six people attend personally at the nomination centre on nomination day is that nomination day, unlike polling day, is&nbsp;not a declared public holiday.&nbsp; In these days of high unemployment, workers find it difficult to get leave from their employers.&nbsp; Worst of all, the date of the nomination day for election is a closely guarded secret, and workers who wish to help in the election process are not able to ask for leave in advance.&nbsp; There are also sudden illnesses.&nbsp; The proposer or seconder may suddenly fall sick on nomination day and be hospitalised.&nbsp; Their absence will constitute a fatal omission on the part of the candidate under the new section 29, and his nomination shall be declared null and void.&nbsp; If the Government is really sincere in wanting to simplify the election procedures, then it should not have this amendment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 653<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like now to speak on the amendments to section 27, in particular section 27(2)(d), where a person to be nominated as an election candidate must make a statutory declaration that he is qualified to be elected.&nbsp; Since the purpose of this Bill is to simplify election procedures, why not just require the candidate to make an ordinary declaration?&nbsp; In that way, the candidate need not take the trouble to appear before a Commissioner for Oaths or a Justice of the&nbsp;Peace, which may prove quite time-consuming and inconvenient.&nbsp; In any event, if a candidate is disqualified under the provisions of the Constitution, I do not think that he would dare declare under an ordinary declaration that he is fit to contest an election.&nbsp; He knows that should he subsequently be found out, he shall forthwith be debarred from taking part in future parliamentary elections.&nbsp; And should he win the election, his seat in Parliament shall be declared null and void.&nbsp; His name shall also be tarnished and his credibility shall be lost forever.&nbsp; Further, he shall also suffer criminal charges for making a false declaration.&nbsp; I do not think that any person in his right mind would ever commit an election offence, as the price is too high.&nbsp; I think that section 27(2)(d) and section 27B(2)(d) which cover GRCs in the amendment should be deleted.&nbsp; Candidates should only be required to make an ordinary declaration, not a statutory one.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other comment I would like to make is on new section 29A which states that the Returning Officer is given the discretion to correct errors and omissions on a nomination form.&nbsp; This amendment appears sensible, for in the past a candidate can be disqualified if he makes a small clerical or typographical error on his nomination form.&nbsp; That law seems unreasonable, but it existed.&nbsp; The present law under the new section definitely makes more sense, although I hasten to say that this amendment benefits the<p align=left>Column: 654<p> ruling Party more than the Opposition.&nbsp; The ruling Party always takes part in election in every constituency, be it a single constituency or a GRC.&nbsp; By its sheer number, the possibility of the ruling Party making a mistake is greater than that of the Opposition.&nbsp; Also, I think the Opposition at this point in time can afford to have one of its GRCs disqualified, but the ruling Party certainly cannot afford to have even one GRC disqualified due to an error or omission under the current law.&nbsp; If that happens, it can cause a domino effect, with the possible final result of the loss of the PAP at the polls.&nbsp; Yes, I do think that the new section 29A has great advantages for the ruling Party.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I sit down, Sir, I would like the Minister to make certain clarifications in regard to the words "the one other person", as mentioned in new sections 30(1A)(c) and 31(c).&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister the following questions:<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;What is the purpose for the candidate to appoint the "other person"?<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;What are the criteria for appointing the "other person"?<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Whether any person, including a foreigner, can be appointed as the "other person"?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to participate in this debate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, every time the Parliamentary Elections Bill comes up for reading, the media and everyone politically interested will start speculating that the General Election is round the corner.&nbsp; I will then receive lots of calls from the journalists or the public asking when is the likely date for the upcoming General Election.&nbsp; It is as if the media and the public&nbsp;assume that I have privileged information as to the date of the&nbsp;election. Alas, this is not the case.&nbsp; I can only speculate, like everyone else, as to what is the likely date, month <p align=left>Column: 655<p>or year that our Prime Minister sets forth or sees as the most favourable date to his party's advantage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if the date of the Presidential elections can be fixed as a full five-year term - so as to give clarity and certainty for its citizens - why then is our Government so reluctant to fix the date of any GE, at least way in advance?&nbsp; Is it because the incumbent Government wants to "<I>bao jia</I>", ie, to have its cake and eat it too?&nbsp; I hope this message helps to remind our Government that if they genuinely want to have a more genuine "open and inclusive" society, then it should learn to play fairly with its worthy opponents.&nbsp; Respect is earned, not demanded.&nbsp; To be respected as a fair and equitable Government, having the people's trust and mandate, the governing party needs to earn it in a fair fight with its contenders and competitors.&nbsp; So, I hope the Government will make it mandatory in the Parliamentary Elections Bill to have at least four months' notice before a General Election is being called.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I like to talk about the election deposit.&nbsp; Election deposit of $500 was fixed for each candidate for 24 years from 1948 till 1972.&nbsp; Since then, it has escalated to our current $12,000.&nbsp; Sir, this $12,000 deposit is peanuts for an elected incumbent MP - which is just one month of his MP's allowance, but it is a big hefty sum for any non-incumbent candidate to fork out for his interest to stand as an election candidate.&nbsp; After forking out this large amount of $12,000 as a deposit, there is not much cash left for the candidate to run an effective electoral campaign for the purpose of the election.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless it is the governing party's hidden agenda&nbsp;to limit the number and ability of its competitors to run an <p align=left>Column: 656<p>effective campaign, I hope the Government will amend this Bill to reduce the size of the election deposit to half or less than half a month of an MP's allowance, instead of a full month as is the current practice.&nbsp; This act will immediately help to inspire more citizens who want to serve the country (through a non-governing party, ie, a non-PAP party) to consider taking up the duty of being a competitor to an incumbent PAP MP, so as to better serve the interest of the people in that constituency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, I like to talk about giving more citizens the chance to exercise their voting rights as a citizen in an election.&nbsp; Sir, it is a fact that the Opposition in Singapore is very weak, and almost to the point of non-existent.&nbsp; I know, Sir, because I am from the Opposition.&nbsp; Unless it is the governing party's desire to wipe out its able competitors, and only allowing for a semblance to exist - for its public showcase - I think the Government can do a lot by introducing back more single-member constituencies and smaller-sized GRCs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1997 and 2001 General Elections,&nbsp;nine out of&nbsp;nine single-member constituencies were contested, making it a 100% contest.&nbsp; But this is not the case for the GRCs.&nbsp; By crowding itself in super-sized GRCs, the Government is giving the public an impression that its Ministers and MPs are afraid of a genuine contest.&nbsp; They hide behind the size in numbers, knowing full well that their position and strength are secured by the weakness of the Opposition to contest in any kind of large GRC.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, if the Prime Minister's word of a more "open and inclusive" society is to be believed, then he will do well to heed the public's aspiration - to give them more chances to cast their votes in a General Election.&nbsp; By making 50% of the 84 parliamentary seats</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

Sir, please do not allow the Government or its Ministers to blame the Opposition, to blame us&nbsp;for our failure to field candidates to fight the elections.&nbsp; Until the Opposition in Singapore is given a genuine opportunity to establish itself as a viable, credible alternative political institution, all this blame-laying is just an excuse for the governing party to retain its power and control - at the expense of a genuine democracy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth,&nbsp;again, to be a genuine open democracy with free and fair competition, the Government needs to put this Parliamentary Elections Act under the jurisdiction of an Independent Elections Commission.&nbsp; I have talked much about it previously.&nbsp; I do not want to belabour it.&nbsp; But I just want&nbsp;the Government to seriously consider it again for the greater benefit of our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Sir, I refer to clause 7 of the amendment to section 29.&nbsp; Like Mr Chiam before me, I read with concern that the Bill is amended such that the candidate must submit his nomination papers "accompanied by his proposer, seconder and&nbsp; at least four assentors" in person at the nomination centre.&nbsp; Sir, this amendment will greatly inconvenience the non-incumbent candidate's proposer, seconder and his four assentors.&nbsp; Already, it is tough for non-governing parties to find candidates to contest in an election.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those people who are interested to contest as an Opposition candidate, it is even tougher still for them as somebody new to politics&nbsp;to find residents living in that constituency willing to put their names down as proposer, seconder and assentors for the Opposition candidates that&nbsp;are challenging the PAP incumbent.&nbsp; Sir, there is great fear in putting one's name down for anything not PAP - talk <p align=left>Column: 658<p>about putting one's&nbsp;name to support a challenger to the PAP!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the Government wants to make it even tougher for the non-PAP candidates by requiring that the proposer, seconder and assentors must be physically present on nomindation day at the nomination centre&nbsp;between 11.00 am&nbsp;and 12.00 noon.&nbsp; It is akin to asking these concerned citizens to be physically identified by the PAP and its grassroots activities in that constituency for target practice.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are only a few <I>garang</I> and brave souls willing to do that.&nbsp; And chances&nbsp;are that a non-incumbent new candidate asked by the Opposition will not know who&nbsp;they are or where they are from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, why is the PAP Government doing this?&nbsp; Either it is out of ignorance, which I do not think so, or they know full well&nbsp;the power of creating fear in their opponents or those who wish to have opponents.&nbsp; If it is out of ignorance, I do hope that this amendment will be immediately amended to make it non-mandatory.&nbsp; But if it is out of genuine intention to create fear among concerned citizens wanting to support their constituencies for a genuine electoral contest, then I will say it bluntly that this action is most despicable of the governing party.&nbsp; I really hope that they will reflect on this and remove this amended clause.&nbsp; Allow the proposer, seconder and assentors the option to sign the nomination paper in the privacy of their homes and no need to take urgent leave from work on the nomination day to be physically present at the nomination centre, if they so choose. Leave the proposer, seconder and the assentors this important option.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to conclude, as Minister Wong Kan Seng said previously in this House and I quote,&nbsp;"It is not the duty of the Government to grow the Opposition," I would like to take this opportunity to <p align=left>Column: 659<p>reiterate and remind the Government that it is also not the duty of the Government nor in its interest to wipe out the non-governing parties too.&nbsp; For Singapore to come out stronger in the next lap of our journey, the governing and non-governing parties must all work together for the interest of Singapore in a fair and democratic manner.&nbsp; Go beyond party politics and focus on the concerns of a fair and democratic society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, overall, the proposed amendments in all the other sections are good, and I support them.&nbsp; But I have to reject the amendments to this Bill because of the proposed clause 7 affecting section 29(2).&nbsp; It is my and every Singaporean's hope that every Minister and MP will not just walk into Parliament without a political contest and retire from political service as a virgin Minister too, without any experience of a political contest.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, generally speaking, I am of the view that the amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act are positive.&nbsp; I think they are an improvement to the Act and also to the election system.&nbsp; However, I do share some concerns and one of which was&nbsp;mentioned by Mr Chiam and Mr Steve Chia on clause 7 of the Bill.&nbsp; But I am not as pessimistic as what Mr Steve Chia thinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are enough courageous Singaporean voters who will be prepared to go to the nomination centre with the Opposition candidates,&nbsp;though I understand there might be some hesitation, which is a fact.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the voters in&nbsp;a particular constituency are so fearful of going to the nomination&nbsp;centre with the Opposition candidates, then forget about it.&nbsp; We do not contest.&nbsp; They cannot vote.&nbsp; They cannot exercise their rights of voting.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;in a parliamentary democracy system of voting, exercising your right&nbsp;is not the sole business of the<p align=left>Column: 660<p> Opposition party.&nbsp; The voters also play a part.&nbsp; So I would expect them to do their part.&nbsp; If they are not even prepared to go with us to the nomination centre, then&nbsp;they do not get to vote.&nbsp; I am sorry.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my concern is why do you need to inconvenience the people of going to the nomination centre. Why is there such a need?&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;others have mentioned, nomination day is not a holiday.&nbsp; So people may have to specially take leave.&nbsp; Why is there a need for you to inconvenience people?&nbsp; Is there any other way in which you could verify the identity of the proposer,&nbsp;seconder and assentors, without having them present themselves at the nomination centre? For instance, you may request for their identity cards to be presented to the Returning Officer by the candidate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next comment I have is on clause 8 on the new section 29A.&nbsp; What is good is that it gives the opportunity for any error on the nomination paper to be corrected before the 12.00 noon deadline as long as you do not change the candidate, the&nbsp;proposer, seconder or assentors.&nbsp; But the section is worded to give discretion to the Returning Officer to decide whether to give the candidate a chance to correct any error.&nbsp; Sir, in the interest of political participation, I would like to suggest that&nbsp;it should be worded in such a way that the Returning Officer must allow the candidate a chance to correct any error so long as it is done by the 12.00 noon deadline.&nbsp; This will clarify the situation for all concerned and take away any pressure on the Returning Officer having to decide and exercise the discretion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Sir, I have a clarification on clause 10 of the Bill, that is, the re-enactment of section 31, in which&nbsp;it says that, "any other person with the written permission of the Returning Officer to be present at those proceedings" at the <p align=left>Column: 661<p>nomination centre.&nbsp;I would like to know what does&nbsp;it mean by "any other person with the written permission".&nbsp; This person, I presume,&nbsp;is not there to assist because new section 31(d) says that the Returning Officer&nbsp;and such other persons authorised by the Returning Officer assist him in such proceedings.&nbsp; So if this other person is not going to assist him, why is he there for?&nbsp; Who are these people likely to be allowed in the nomination centre?&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Sir, I just want to have a point of clarification in my speech.&nbsp; I mentioned wrongly that the election deposit is $12,000.&nbsp; I just want to correct it as $13,000.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> I thank the Members for their comments and their questions on the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;I note in particular that there is this question which requires the appearance of the proposer, seconder and assentors at the nomination centre.&nbsp;I am also very cheered that Mr Low has taken such a sensible and mature approach with regard to the voters having to play a part and not&nbsp;afraid to turn up at the nomination centre and that he does not see that requiring the proposer,&nbsp;seconder and assentors to be present&nbsp;is&nbsp;an obstacle.&nbsp;He is quite optimistic that there will be enough Singaporeans&nbsp;who feel that they want to participate in this process and support the Opposition, and they will turn up together with the candidate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are reasons why this particular amendment is put in.&nbsp; Of course, the current law does not require the proposer, seconder and assentors to turn up.&nbsp; The present law allows the proposer&nbsp;and seconder to be present at the nomination centre.&nbsp;In practice, the PAP&nbsp;candidates always brought along their proposers and seconders.&nbsp; There is no secret about this.&nbsp; They&nbsp;would then&nbsp;know what the nomination process was about.&nbsp; I did not <p align=left>Column: 662<p>know that some Opposition&nbsp;did not bring along their proposers and seconders, and they would have difficulty bringing along assentors if it is required by the law.&nbsp; But the reason why this was put in is that we want to ensure that there is no fraud in that the candidate will just&nbsp;put somebody's name by copying the name of an elector,&nbsp;his serial no. and&nbsp;forging his signature on the form.&nbsp; It is just a hypothetical situation.&nbsp; I do not have evidence of this.&nbsp; But I am told of a story by a colleague that in one of the elections, and I would not name which particular constituency, when one of the PAP's supporters turned up together with the candidate at the nomination centre,&nbsp;he saw his name on the Opposition candidate's list as an assentor.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surprised because he did not sign it.&nbsp; So there could be instances where the candidate could not find enough people within the constituency he was contesting to support him&nbsp;because he did not know the ground. He just filled up the form, looked up the register,&nbsp;filled up the names and forged the signatures.&nbsp; So, in order to ensure that there are indeed electors within the constituency that will support the candidate,&nbsp;this requirement&nbsp;is put in to&nbsp;make sure that&nbsp;the candidate comes with the proposer, seconder and&nbsp;assentors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the forms only have&nbsp;space for up to six assentors, although the law&nbsp;requires a minimum of four.&nbsp; The forms would be revised to allow&nbsp;spaces for eight assentors and it should not be difficult to find six persons - the proposer, seconder and four assentors - to turn up.&nbsp; After all, at every election, during&nbsp;nomination at the nomination centre, we will see hordes of supporters of candidates, both the PAP and the Opposition, turning up at the nomination centre.&nbsp; Indeed, the people who want&nbsp;an Opposition would turn up and support him.&nbsp;There is no reason why these supporters&nbsp;would be made a target practice, as Mr Steve Chia said.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>I think Mr Steve Chia has a wild sense of imagination to dream of this.&nbsp; Let me <p align=left>Column: 663<p>assure him that that is not the case.&nbsp; But if there are indeed difficulties in finding assentors to support him,&nbsp;Mr Chia&nbsp;could let me know. &nbsp;I will try to persuade my colleague in the PAP in that constituency where&nbsp;Mr Chia&nbsp;will be contesting to find&nbsp; supporters for him so that they will be present.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I do&nbsp;not see an obstacle in this here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the other comment that&nbsp;supposing a mistake is made and something needs to be corrected and&nbsp;there is no&nbsp;Commissioner for Oaths&nbsp;to help&nbsp;the candidate&nbsp;to&nbsp;affirm the declaration&nbsp;and the whole process would be made difficult and, as a result, the candidate cannot contest, let me assure the Member that, this time round, the Elections Department would be very approachable and helpful.&nbsp; They would make available enough forms so that, if indeed a candidate needs to fill up&nbsp;a fresh set of forms with&nbsp;names from among his supporters who are present and who could be their proposer and seconder, the forms&nbsp;and a Commissioner for Oaths would be made available.&nbsp; So, in the case of Aljunied&nbsp;where the Workers' Party had candidates wanting to contest in the 2001&nbsp;elections and, unfortunately, the forms were filled&nbsp;without the name of the constituency, the forms were rejected.&nbsp; This time round, I think it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;possible to correct an error like that, if&nbsp;it is done before 12 noon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the Opposition&nbsp;can see that the Government is not making it difficult for them in the&nbsp;election process.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed trying to make it as simple as possible, eg, simplifying forms and making&nbsp;available forms as well as the Commissioner for Oaths and computers with registers of electors, so that the candidates&nbsp;can access and check whether indeed the person who is an assentor, proposer or seconder, or even&nbsp;a candidate of the Opposition is indeed a registered voter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 664<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam asked about the "one other person".&nbsp; What is this "one other person"?&nbsp; Actually, the "one other person" is the one other person&nbsp;who can&nbsp;help the candidate.&nbsp; We have a "one other person" who came along with us - I am telling&nbsp;Mr Chiam&nbsp;a bit of our election preparedness secrets - and that "one other person" is a lawyer.&nbsp; So, in the event&nbsp;we have difficulty understanding some rules, then that "one other person", who is legally-qualified, can browse through the Parliamentary Elections Act and the regulations and help explain to us what they&nbsp;mean.&nbsp; So, there are no difficult criteria to satisfy.&nbsp; So long as that person can understand the Parliamentary Elections Act, that person can be the "one other person".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can he be a foreigner?&nbsp; I think he needs to fill in&nbsp;the name of the "one other person", and I believe he ought to be a Singaporean because we want Singaporeans to be involved in our political process and not foreigners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chia raised other questions too, eg, election deposit.&nbsp; Is the $13,000 too much?&nbsp; Indeed, there were people who turned up and some lost their deposits.&nbsp; But that is not because the election deposit is too much.&nbsp; It is because they just could not get the support of the voters.&nbsp; Election is a serious business.&nbsp; It should not just be one where one can go and <I>tikam-tikam</I> and put $2 and hopefully&nbsp;win.&nbsp; No such thing.&nbsp; Election is serious business and, therefore, the election deposit, being one-eighth of the total parliamentary allowance paid in the year before the election, is not a big sum of money, whether it is to the PAP candidates or to the others.&nbsp; And I am sure that they can find enough people who will support them and loan them the money because, if they get one-eighth of the votes, they will get their money back.&nbsp; So, it should not be difficult in raising that sum of money.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 665<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On why does&nbsp;the Government not fix the date of the elections, or at least provide the period&nbsp;for an&nbsp;election to be held&nbsp;and give enough notice,&nbsp;I have explained this before,&nbsp;most recently during the Committee of Supply in March, where I said that this is something we have had for so long, that it works well, and that it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to decide on when to have an election.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;no reason why&nbsp;four months' notice&nbsp;should be given.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Presidental election, that was a practice we put in, and it is in the law that an election should be held within three months before the end of the President's term.&nbsp; Our President's term ends on 1st September.&nbsp; That was when Mr Nathan assumed his presidency.&nbsp; So an election will be held three months&nbsp;before that date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the size of a GRC is another perennial complaint of Mr Chia. &nbsp;I think that again should not be a difficult issue because, so long as he can find enough people to contest, he should be able to get the voters to support him, if he has worked the ground hard enough.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;setting up an independent Elections Commission, again, I have dealt with this in March, so I will not belabour the point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chia made one interesting point, ie,&nbsp;it is not in Singapore's interest to wipe out the Opposition parties.&nbsp; We never said we will wipe out the Opposition parties.&nbsp; In fact, we encourage more people to come forward, whether to join the PAP or the Opposition, but, eventually, it is the people who will decide who they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;For so many years now,&nbsp;the people have confidence in the PAP and, therefore, they re-elected the PAP to Government term after term.&nbsp; If the Opposition has difficulty attracting people to stand for election, I <p align=left>Column: 666<p>think they should do some soul-searching and see how they can reach out further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low raised one other point, ie, regarding the correction of errors, in clause 8 to amend&nbsp;section 29.&nbsp; As I have said, the Returning Officer will give as much time as possible, up to 12 noon, to the candidate to correct the errors.&nbsp; And if there is indeed error spotted and the form cannot be accepted, I think it will be pointed out to him so that he can then make the necessary correction.&nbsp; But it is not the job of the Returning Officer or his election officials to correct errors for the candidate.&nbsp; The filling up of the form and filling it correctly are the responsibility of the candidates concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On clause 10 regarding the "one other person", I have explained that already.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If I am not mistaken, the Minister just now mentioned that the "one other person" should not be a foreigner, and that the Returning Officer would not allow it.&nbsp; But under the new amendment to the Act, it says here that the "one other person" is appointed not by the Returning Officer, but by the candidate.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In all the past instances, we have got a legally-qualified person, because that person will then explain to the PAP candidate what was the issue, if the Returning Officer or his official says, "The following things have not been complied with", and then there will be some discussions, and that is the job of our "one other person".&nbsp;

Sir, as our presidential elections are run on similar lines as that for parliamentary elections, this Bill proposes amendments to the Presidential Elections Act similar to that in the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill 2005, which we have just passed.&nbsp; In summary, the amendments in this Bill are as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;To simplify nomination procedures by reducing the number of papers filed and the amount of particulars to be filled up in nomination papers;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;To reduce the risk of aspiring individuals failing to be nominated due to formal errors or non-compliance with procedures by allowing nominees and candidates to amend nomination papers to rectify non-fatal errors before the close of nominations, and by including blanks and errors in number in nomination papers as non-fatal errors;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Introduction</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in summing up the debate on the President's Address in January this year, PM spoke about Singapore being a land of opportunity, as a nation where everyone belongs, where each person has a role to play, and where all can live with dignity. &nbsp;In particular, he noted that, as a land of opportunity, we should provide, for those who have committed mistakes, a second chance to make good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill is a step in that direction: to provide a second chance for ex-offenders who have paid their dues to society and have shown the resolve and ability to stay away from crime. We are amending the Registration of Criminals Act or "RCA" to allow the record of a conviction kept in the Register of Criminals for a less serious crime to be considered as spent if the person stays clean for a specified period. The purpose is to help such deserving ex-offenders put their past behind them. Indeed, together with the Home Detention scheme which MHA introduced&nbsp;five years ago and&nbsp;which we recently enhanced, these are two key platforms to help offenders and ex-offenders reintegrate into society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the RCA, Police keeps records in the Register of Criminals of persons convicted of any crime specified in the First and Second Schedules of the Act.&nbsp; Particulars such as the photograph, finger impressions, and conviction records are recorded.&nbsp; It is a record for life. The Register of Criminals is very useful in Police investigations, especially in the identification of suspects. The courts also<p align=left>Column: 673<p> make use of these criminal records when sentencing repeat offenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Giving ex-offenders a second chance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While society must be protected from recalcitrant offenders who persist in committing crimes, there are ex-offenders who have genuinely turned over a new leaf.&nbsp; Many of these people were convicted of minor crimes many years ago and have since demonstrated that they can stay away from trouble. They therefore deserve to be given a second chance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One such ex-offender that we know of is a university graduate in her late twenties who was convicted in court and fined $1,000 for theft several years ago.&nbsp; Since then, this lady has turned over a new leaf and stayed away from crime.&nbsp; However, many employers were reluctant to employ her.&nbsp; There were a few occasions when she managed to get a job but each time, the constant fear and sense of insecurity caused her to resign after a few weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the assistance of the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises or&nbsp;"SCORE", this lady graduate managed to find an employer willing to give her a second chance. This has greatly improved her morale and self-worth.&nbsp; There are many other similar examples of ex-offenders who have turned over a new leaf, but continue to encounter difficulties in their search for gainful employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHA recognises that there is a need to facilitate the reintegration of ex-offenders into our society.&nbsp; To this end, SCORE already plays a key role in providing inmates with opportunities to pick up useful skills, to enhance their chances of landing a job when released from prison.&nbsp; The "Yellow Ribbon" project, jointly organised by member agencies of the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-offenders or "CARE" Network, aims to remove the social<p align=left>Column: 674<p> stigma faced by those who have been convicted of crimes.&nbsp; We are gratified by the strong support from the public for this project.&nbsp; While these initiatives have greatly benefited ex-offenders, more can be done to help those who have since stayed on the right side of the law.&nbsp; There are also other initiatives like the Community Tele Movies, Toilet-Kitchen, Coming Home and other projects mounted by CARE Network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reviewing the RCA, MHA studied the two options of either expunging the record or rendering it spent.&nbsp; Expunging a record means erasing the record completely, to the extent that the ex-offender is deemed to have never been convicted of that offence.&nbsp; In contrast, when a person's record becomes spent, he is deemed to have no record of that conviction, but it does not remove the fact of conviction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we are making a start in this area, we have decided to do so on a more cautious note, by providing for criminal records to become spent.&nbsp; In the light of experience gained, we can consider expunging criminal records in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Rendering criminal records as spent</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now highlight the main features of the Bill.&nbsp; First of all, the new section 7B provides that a record in the Register of Criminals of a person convicted of a minor crime will automatically be marked as spent, if he satisfies a&nbsp;five year crime-free period.&nbsp; For offenders who are sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the crime-free period would be determined from the date of the person's release from custody.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a person's record of a conviction is marked as spent, the new section 7E deems him to have no record of that conviction in the Register of Criminals.&nbsp; If asked whether he has a "criminal record", the person can lawfully answer "no". &nbsp;He does not have to disclose its existence in <p align=left>Column: 675<p>most circumstances, especially when applying for a job.&nbsp; The ex-offender can treat such questions as not relating to his spent criminal record.&nbsp; Therefore, if he decides not to disclose a spent criminal record, he cannot be denied employment or subsequently dismissed on the grounds that he failed to disclose it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as I have said earlier, these amendments do not completely delete a person's criminal record.&nbsp; Hence, a record that becomes spent does not remove the fact of the conviction.&nbsp; So, an ex-offender whose record is marked as spent must still disclose his conviction if specifically asked about a "previous conviction", for example, if the question asked is if he has ever been convicted by a court of law.&nbsp; The record will also be surfaced in investigations authorised by law and in connection with court proceedings.</p><p><br><I>Disqualified ex-offenders</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this, of course, cannot be at the expense of public safety and security.&nbsp; My Ministry has given much thought to the profile of persons who pose the lowest risk to society and should therefore be allowed to have their criminal records rendered spent.&nbsp; Trying to define a minor crime by the maximum sentence allowable could result in anomalies.&nbsp; So, we decided that the actual sentence meted out would be a more realistic criterion.&nbsp; Hence, the new section 7C provides that to qualify for a record to be spent, the ex-offender must not have been sentenced to an imprisonment term exceeding&nbsp;three months or to a fine exceeding $2,000.&nbsp; The majority of those eligible to have their records spent will be those who have committed minor offences, such as shop theft and gaming in a common gaming house.&nbsp; Persons convicted of serious offences listed in the new Third Schedule, <p align=left>Column: 676<p>such as culpable homicide, sexual offences and drug trafficking, are disqualified from having their records spent under the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill also disqualifies an ex-offender who has more than one record in the Register of Criminals from having his criminal record marked as spent.&nbsp; In addition, an ex-offender is allowed to have only one of his criminal records in the Register of Criminals marked as spent in his lifetime.&nbsp; Thus, an ex-offender is given only one second chance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some legislation, such as the Architects Act, Medical Registration Act and Legal Profession Act, stipulate that a person convicted of certain offences, such as those involving dishonesty, will be disqualified from either joining the profession or appointment to certain posts within the profession. This amendment to the RCA will not displace any of the existing requirements in the law for these professions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Application to have criminal record treated as spent</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new section 7D enables an ex-offender who is otherwise disqualified to apply to the Commissioner of Police to treat his record in the Register of Criminals as spent.&nbsp; In deciding whether to grant the application, the Commissioner of Police will consider factors such as the nature and severity of the offence, the sentence imposed and the applicant's conduct subsequent to the conviction.&nbsp; This provides some flexibility in administering the scheme,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>and ensures that those who do not satisfy the criteria, but are nevertheless deserving of a second chance, can benefit from this policy.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Records of offences not kept in the Register of Criminals</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 677<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to another important aspect of the Bill, which concerns the records of offences that are not kept in the Register of Criminals.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Definition of "criminal record"</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, not everyone convicted of an offence ends up with a record in the Register of Criminals. Only those offences listed in the First and Second Schedules of the Act, commonly known as "registrable offences", will result in a criminal record in the Register of Criminals. Many offences are non-registrable. These tend to be minor or regulatory in nature, such as parking or littering offences. For these non-registrable offences, the department concerned which enforces them would keep its own records.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employers often ask questions about a potential employee's previous criminal record or conviction. We feel it is not necessary to stigmatise persons who commit minor, technical or regulatory offences as "criminals" with "criminal records". Hence, in line with the intention of giving such ex-offenders a second chance, we have introduced a new section 7F in the RCA so that records of these non-registrable offences are not regarded as "criminal records".</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of section 7F is that when a person is asked about his criminal record, that question will be taken to refer only to a criminal record as defined in the RCA, ie, the record of convictions for registrable offences. A person who has been convicted of only non-registrable offences can say he has no criminal record. A person who has been convicted of some registrable and some non-registrable offences is only obliged to disclose his registrable offences, unless these are treated as spent by the amendments.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 678<p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MHA is currently working with other Ministries to ensure that the list of registrable offences is updated and contains the more serious offences, leaving the minor regulatory offences as non-registrable. This approach ties in with what Government is doing through the Ministry of Law&nbsp; -&nbsp;my other hat&nbsp; -&nbsp; which,&nbsp;together with the Attorney-General's Chambers, is spearheading a drive to decriminalise minor, regulatory offences. So that is part of the larger pattern.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>The role of employers</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now speak on the role of employers. Whilst deleting criminal records is a useful step, the key consideration is really the attitude of our employers. To give ex-offenders a second chance, employers should consider dovetailing with these amendments by not inquiring about previous convictions of a prospective employee. Instead, they should consider asking, for example, whether he has a criminal record. In this way, a person need not dredge up a past conviction which could have occurred many years ago, the record of which has already been spent. Because of the safeguards in the Bill, employers can rest assured that only one-time offenders who were convicted of minor crimes can have records rendered spent. In this regard, MHA will be actively engaging employers to try to encourage and persuade them to adopt an enlightened view in employing ex-offenders.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><I>Implementation</I></p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in terms of implementation, once the Bill comes into operation, ex-offenders whose records have been rendered spent will be informed by letter. As there are a large number of records that need to be verified and checked, some of which go back many, many&nbsp;years, the letters will be sent out sometime in September or October this year. We are taking extra <p align=left>Column: 679<p>care to minimise the inconvenience and embarrassment that may result from errors. In addition, to enable those who think they may benefit from the "spent" regime to check on their status, we plan to set up an e-Portal to allow them to verify whether they have a criminal record that has been rendered spent. This system will be ready within the next&nbsp;nine months. In the meantime, Police will provide more information by way of FAQs&nbsp;on its website.&nbsp; This is readily available to Singaporeans who want to know more about this new scheme.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these amendments will, for a start, result in about 120,000 ex-offenders having their records rendered spent. Thereafter, we estimate that some 9,000 ex-offenders will benefit annually from this "spent" regime.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, by providing for certain criminal records to become spent, the Government is taking another important step to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society, not just Government but together with other partners and agencies. Especially for those who have genuinely repented and are determined to make a fresh start, society as a whole should be more embracing and more supportive. This is especially so for those who have kept to the straight and narrow path for some time after being released from prison.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly support the intention behind the amendment which is to allow an ex-offender who has turned over a new leaf to have a second chance and to start on a clean slate.&nbsp; The proposed amendments <p align=left>Column: 680<p>are useful because, first, they allow the ex-offender who has a criminal record that has been spent to be deemed to have no record of that conviction.&nbsp; And, secondly, because it is tied to him having a five-year period of being crime free, it is a powerful incentive to help that person stay crime free and therefore have his record spent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concerns I have though are whether the amendments either go far enough or whether the legislative framework may have some difficulties in terms of implementation.&nbsp; I think the most pertinent point will be the one which the Senior Minister of State has highlighted, and that is the attitude of employers.&nbsp; Because we have decided to embark on the regime where records are spent rather than expunged, it means that the fact of the conviction remains even though you can say that you now no longer have a record, and it does mean, as the Senior Minister of State has illustrated, that if an employer asks you point blank, "Do you have a criminal record?", you can truthfully answer yes.&nbsp; But if he asks you point blank, "Have you ever been convicted?", you cannot truthfully say no.&nbsp; You have to say, "Yes, I have been convicted.", which means that the ex-offender's employability or his ability to get a second chance is dependent, to some extent, on how the employer frames the question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are only two ways to deal with that.&nbsp; One possibility is to legislate on it and we say that the employers have to ask the question in a particular way, ie, they can only ask whether you have a record.&nbsp; But the question is whether we want to interfere too much in the employer's HR practices, and particularly for those in the private sector, because&nbsp;we do want them to have a certain autonomy in the way they run their HR business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alternative would be that we have to, both as employers and society, change<p align=left>Column: 681<p>our mindset, and to now slowly realise that there is another category that has come into being.&nbsp; Instead of the previous two categories, which is&nbsp;either offender or non-offender, there is now a third category of someone who has been an offender but because&nbsp;it is spent,&nbsp;we should treat him or her differently than someone who still has a record, and that obviously is going to need, if&nbsp;we go that route, a lot of persuasion and&nbsp;cooperation, and we would need the employers as well as members of society on board for that.&nbsp; And I think that is a role that should be played not just by MHA but something which the Ministry of Manpower should be working on as well, and employers' associations, such as the Singapore National Employers' Federation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Senior Minister of State to clarify two points.&nbsp; One, when explaining why we had decided to go along the regime of spent records rather than having the records expunged, he said that it was because this is a new legislation and we want to proceed cautiously.&nbsp; If I could just inquire, what are the specific concerns about having a regime where these records are expunged?&nbsp; Is there something that we are particularly afraid of or concerned about that we have seen from experience with the legislation in other countries, or is this just a general concern?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second clarification I would like to seek is: &nbsp;what happens to the registrable particulars of these ex-offenders whose records have been spent?&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; Under the RCA, the Registrar of Criminals keeps a register.&nbsp; And on that register are various particulars.&nbsp; It includes the&nbsp;conviction, particulars of the offence, but it also includes things like the ex-offender's fingerprints.&nbsp; And if a person is charged with a crime but is subsequently acquitted or completely discharged, the fingerprint records and the photographs which are on the register are destroyed.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 682<p>And they are destroyed because the person is deemed innocent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a similar approach with respect to the DNA database that is also kept by the Registrar.&nbsp; For these ex-offenders who had their records spent but whose convictions can sometimes be referred to for particular purposes such as investigations or court proceedings, what happens to their registrable particulars, in particular their finger prints and DNA records?&nbsp; Do they remain on the register or are they destroyed as well, similar to those who are acquitted or discharged?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</B> Sir, the big issue that arises here is what we, as a society, should do as regards ex-offenders.&nbsp; Our paramount concern is to reintegrate them back into the mainstream.&nbsp; We want them to quickly get back to their families, get back to work, get back to normal living. The RCA was not intended to deal with ex-offenders as such, but to deal with the records of their convictions.&nbsp; However, it is a fact that such records have significant effects on the lives of ex-offenders, sometimes even long after they had completed their full sentences, and this significance is usually in the negative&nbsp; -&nbsp; social stigma and a major minus point in job applications.&nbsp; Any effort to reduce this negative effect is welcome, bearing in mind our basic concern to reintegrate ex-convicts into mainstream society.&nbsp; So I think the Bill has its heart in the right place and I welcome it.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I think the treatment of ex-offenders is best managed by society through its own actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Legislation can only do so much.&nbsp; The Minister and my colleague, Ms Indranee, had given examples of this.&nbsp; We cannot legislate against employers from asking the question to a potential employee, "Have you been convicted of an offence?".&nbsp; If asked such a question, the applicant has to answer yes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 683<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, even if his criminal records were to be expunged, the fact that he has a criminal conviction remains.&nbsp; While records may not show any conviction on his part, the ex-offender if asked that question will still be placed in a moral dilemma whether to be honest and be on his way to redeeming his past misdeeds but risk not getting a job and therefore delaying his process of reintegration or to lie, ie, to commit another wrong so as to secure a living for himself and his family in his efforts to reintegrate back into society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make things worse, this lie may be found out with even more devastating results.&nbsp; Once, a friend of mine, a manager of an organisation, employed a man with a previous conviction, but the fact of this conviction was not made known.&nbsp; After a year or so, the manager asked for details of the man's previous experience, as the manager wanted to consider the man for suitability for a course.&nbsp; The man was unable to furnish his full records.&nbsp; There was a gap of about 15 months unaccounted for.&nbsp; He was not able to come up with a convincing story to cover that long break.&nbsp; At last, he admitted to having spent time in jail.&nbsp; The manager was greatly disappointed, less by the fact that the man had a conviction</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>but more by the fact that the said conviction was not made known.&nbsp; The manager felt that he could not fully trust the man that much after that.&nbsp; Their relationship strained greatly.&nbsp; After a few months from that incident, the man tendered his resignation.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the point is Parliament cannot pass legislation to force employers not to ask certain questions such as, "Have you been convicted of an offence?"&nbsp; There is&nbsp;a limit as to what legislation can do.&nbsp; Indeed, the public, including employers, should have the right to know who they <p align=left>Column: 684<p>are dealing with.&nbsp; They have the right to know his or her history to see whether he or she is suitable for jobs available.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, this Parliament can and should urge society, especially employers - and I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Ms Indranee - to play its part in reintegrating ex-offenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, there are segments of society that have done much.&nbsp; I wish to declare my interest, here, Sir, as a member of the Board of SCORE.&nbsp; SCORE's partners include hundreds of employers who have shown willingness not only to employ ex-offenders but also to provide them with relevant training.&nbsp; I wish to thank them for their care and their help.&nbsp; But the number of such positive employers is too small.&nbsp; Even after getting jobs, many ex-offenders face class barriers in their workplaces.&nbsp; Many also carry the additional burden of being stigmatised by family and ex-friends for years.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help reduce these difficulties, the "Yellow Ribbon" project, which the Senior Minister of State&nbsp;made mention of just now, was launched last year.&nbsp; It was and still is a widely publicised campaign to raise public awareness of the challenges faced by ex-offenders and the issues involved.&nbsp; I understand that the Hon. Prime Minister had promised on television that he would attend the event this year because he missed the "Yellow Ribbon" event last year.&nbsp; I thank the Prime Minister for this.&nbsp; Now it is recorded in <I>Hansard</I> as well. The "Yellow Ribbon" project has to have a high profile and wide outreach because it is important that our society gives its wholehearted support.&nbsp; As I said earlier, it is not feasible to enforce support by legislation.&nbsp; We have to garner support by education and persuasion.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also think, Sir, that the public sector can do more to help.&nbsp; I stand corrected on this point.&nbsp; But my impression is that <p align=left>Column: 685<p>anyone with a conviction - registrable offences - will find immense difficulty in&nbsp;getting a job from the public sector.&nbsp; Recently, two persons approached me to appeal to the Land Transport Authority to obtain taxi driving licences.&nbsp; Their applications were turned down due to "regard for public safety".&nbsp; Both persons admitted to me that they had previous convictions.&nbsp; However, one was for a white-collar crime and the other for drug consumption.&nbsp; I believe that their previous convictions were given undue weightage by the LTA.&nbsp; I wish to add that they were not my residents.&nbsp; So I did not write in.&nbsp; I advised them to seek their own MPs and&nbsp;gave them general advice.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector and all employers should avoid applying blanket rulings.&nbsp; While we appreciate their need to be careful, let us not reject the whole basket just because of one rotten apple.&nbsp; Each case should be dealt with individually. Each application must be assessed on its merits.&nbsp; And I think, in our context, the public sector should take the lead.&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister whether he agrees with this and, if so, what steps will the Government take in this respect.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill seeks to ameliorate, in some way, the ill effects of maintaining criminal records.&nbsp; I thank the Minister and his officials for putting their minds to do this.&nbsp; But this Bill does not and cannot resolve the issue of how our society should treat ex-offenders.&nbsp; If our society wishes to be harsh and it is not forgiving, even if all records are expunged, there will be ways and means for these convictions to be made known and used against ex-offenders.&nbsp; Conversely, if our society is overly forgiving, then whatever negative records available would not make much difference.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we go along, we need to strike a balance between a few conflicting principles:&nbsp; First, how much we want to forgive and accommodate our members'<p align=left>Column: 686<p> past misdeeds and be a caring society?&nbsp; Second, how much we want our ex-offenders to come back into our fold?&nbsp; Third, to what extent we want to protect our society from possible dangers?&nbsp; And fourth, to what extent should society have access to records of ex-offenders?<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our society evolves, we seem to gain the confidence and willingness to be more forgiving.&nbsp; This is partly attributable to strong law enforcement, transparent prosecutorial process, a very independent judiciary and a keen observance of the rule of law.&nbsp; The strength of our judicial and legal institutions rightfully should give us equal strength to be more flexible and more caring to ex-offenders after they complete their sentence - the strength to be a more gracious society.&nbsp; For all its shortcomings, this Bill demonstrates the Government's continuous search to balance the need to reintegrate ex-offenders into society on the one hand and the need to maintain records of offences for society's future protection and benefit on the other.&nbsp; Seen in a larger context, I agree that it is part of our&nbsp;quest to be a more gracious and caring society.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the Bill.</p></span></div>									       		<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      					<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 686<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>EXEMPTED BUSINESS<BR></B></span><div><BR>								<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Motion--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Motion)<BR></B></span><div><BR>			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today&nbsp;be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 2. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].&nbsp;</p></span></div>									       		<!--SECTION_NAME:BILLS-->      					<!--TITLE_NAME:REGISTRATION OF CRIMINALS (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 686<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>REGISTRATION OF CRIMINALS (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate resumed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.&nbsp; I would like to <p align=left>Column: 687<p>applaud the Ministry of Home Affairs for making this amendment as I feel that it will help our ex-offenders to look for jobs and integrate into our society.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone, Sir, deserves a second chance.&nbsp; This amendment will give that much needed second chance to those who have committed minor offences.&nbsp; We have heard over the last few months of the difficulties faced by many ex-offenders who cannot get jobs even though they have turned over a new leaf. This amendment alone will not remove the social stigma that our society sometimes unforgivingly attaches to people, but, at least, it will help to reduce some barriers.&nbsp; Much more needs to be done, and this certainly goes beyond the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are a couple of points which I wish to raise.&nbsp; One of them has already been raised by my colleagues who spoke before me, and that is concerning the fact that this Bill mentions about a record being spent but that the conviction still remains.&nbsp; On the ground, when a person - a layman -&nbsp;is asked by an employer whether he has a previous conviction or whether his record is spent, it is difficult for the person to make that kind of a distinction.&nbsp; So he may end up in either one or two situations.&nbsp; He may think that having his criminal record spent means that the conviction is no longer there and, therefore, he may reply "no"&nbsp;when he is asked, "Do you have a previous conviction?".&nbsp; In that situation, he may then be violating the law because he does have a criminal conviction, as what has been removed is only his record as it is treated as spent but his conviction remains.&nbsp; So his reply may not be correct.&nbsp; But a lay person may not understand that distinction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second situation could be that an employer may ask him, after being <p align=left>Column: 688<p>thoroughly educated - as my colleagues in this House have suggested,&nbsp;we should educate employers, which I thoroughly agree -&nbsp;"Do you have a criminal record?".&nbsp; But&nbsp;he may not understand that he should reply to the question "no", and he may&nbsp;then answer "yes" because, to him, having a criminal record and a&nbsp;criminal conviction are&nbsp;one&nbsp;and the same thing.&nbsp; So this confusion, I think, to some extent, will weaken the impact of this Act, unless the Ministry takes it upon itself to educate employers thoroughly and also the ex-offenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point about this amendment, Sir, is that&nbsp;the primary objective is obviously to try and help rehabilitate ex-offenders by helping them to secure employment.&nbsp; But in the Bill itself, there is nothing to stipulate as to what happens if an employer subsequently, if he discovers that this person has a conviction,&nbsp; dismisses him on that ground.&nbsp; So I think that is an important consideration as well because at that point of time, assuming that he replies he has no record, and subsequently it is discovered that he has,&nbsp;he is dismissed by the employer on that ground, there is nothing in the law to actually take care of his interests or protect him.&nbsp; So I would like to suggest that in this situation, the Ministry of&nbsp;Home Affairs&nbsp;should work very closely with the Ministry of Manpower and&nbsp;the employers as well to educate them on the various facets of this Act as well as to explain to them the importance of not discriminating or using that as a ground to subsequently dismiss ex-offenders who have secured employment with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point I wish to raise, Sir, is with regard to the need to make ex-offenders understand this new amendment.&nbsp; I note what the Senior Minister of State had said about setting up a portal and individually informing the ex-offenders.&nbsp; But I think the Ministry could go much further than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would<p align=left>Column: 689<p> like to recommend that the Ministry set up a system which ex-offenders can access on their own to ascertain the status of their criminal record as not all offences are covered under the amendment.&nbsp; There are offences where the records will be automatically treated as spent while others require a person to apply to the Commissioner for Police to have his record treated as spent, and the discretion lies with the Commissioner whether or not to approve the application.&nbsp; Even for records that will be automatically treated as spent, the effective date that this takes place varies, depending on the situation.&nbsp; For example, for someone with a custodial sentence, the five-year period starts after he completes his prison term.&nbsp; Whereas if the penalty is only a fine, the period starts from the date that the sentence is passed.&nbsp; It is not possible for us to expect a person to understand the various legal positions to determine whether&nbsp;or not his criminal record&nbsp;is spent.&nbsp; This may lead to a situation where a person may unwittingly commit an offence under the Act, by failing to declare his conviction which he thought is spent when he has actually not met all the criteria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in New Zealand, which has a similar law, individuals can request for a copy of the criminal record from the Privacy Assistant of the Ministry of Justice to determine if they meet the criteria.&nbsp; The New Zealand's Ministry of Justice has also developed information pamphlets to increase awareness of the effect of their legislation as part of their public information campaign to ensure that potential employers know about the effect of the legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the pamphlets have been distributed to employers.&nbsp; Individuals can also secure a copy of the pamphlet from the courts, police stations, community law centres and other public places.&nbsp; They can also view the pamphlets online, and these pamphlets, Sir, are available in English, <p align=left>Column: 690<p>Maori, Samoan, Tongan and other ethnic languages in New Zealand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the Ministry of Law provide a similar service where persons can access to ascertain&nbsp;whether their criminal records are spent.&nbsp; The Ministry of Law can also conduct an awareness campaign targeting employers as well as the public.&nbsp; Such pamphlets could also be made available to individuals in the CDCs, CCs, police stations, courts as well as online.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other jurisdictions where there is a similar law, where the records are not automatically spent such as the US, for instance, the power to decide on a person's application is usually vested in the court.&nbsp; In the present amendment, for those offences where the records are not treated as automatically spent, the disqualified person has to apply to the Commissioner for Police if he wants his record to be treated as spent.&nbsp; I think, considering that the Police is also the authority responsible for making arrests and maintaining law and order in Singapore, it may be more appropriate, in my view, for the application to be determined by a court.&nbsp; The Minister's comments on this would be helpful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, the amendment seeks to provide some safeguards by stipulating that even if a person's record is treated as spent, for appointments to any job or any office, or for admission to any profession or vocation which by law disqualifies&nbsp;a person with a conviction, then the person is legally obliged to reveal that he has a criminal record.&nbsp; This amendment, as I understand it, seeks to try and balance what we can see as conflicting interests - on the one hand, the interest of the ex-offender and his desire and also in the public interest that he may be integrated into society, and then there is also the other aspect,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

I note that under the new section 7E(2)(d), it is&nbsp;stipulated that for any appointment or job or any profession or vocation which by law disqualifies a person with a conviction, then the person is legally obliged to reveal that he has a criminal record.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that, with this provision,&nbsp;the safeguards may be too narrow. For example, if a person with a previous grievous hurt record which is spent applies for a job in a school, he need not reveal about his record during the interview since there is no law disqualifying him from doing such a job.&nbsp; Although this will put him in a situation where he will come into frequent and close contact with young children,&nbsp;I believe that&nbsp;it must be the intention of section 7E(2)(d) to protect such groups.&nbsp; The present section does not cover this situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the UK, Sir, a person is not obliged to disclose a criminal conviction which is spent when applying for a job.&nbsp; However, there is an exception to this rule for exempt posts which are jobs that involve working with, for example, children, young people, the sick, old or vulnerable.&nbsp; Under the New South Wales law, a person will have to reveal to an employer about the spent conviction if he is applying for a job in a position of public trust, such as teachers, teaching aides or childcare providers.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I would like to seek the Senior Minister of State's clarification on this point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, this is an important and good amendment.&nbsp; It will definitely provide more avenues for employment and better integration into society for ex-offenders.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir, I thank Ms Indranee Rajah, GPC Chairman, Mr Ahmad Khalis and Mdm Halimah&nbsp;for<p align=left>Column: 692<p> supporting the Bill and, more specifically, for the very useful comments and points they have made.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, an enduring theme in their speeches is the importance of reaching out to employers.&nbsp; I think that is the key point. As Ms Indranee Rajah said, it is important to change their mindsets.&nbsp; Like Mr Ahmad Khalis and Mdm Halimah have said, it is important to reach out to them and to convince them that this scheme is worth supporting.&nbsp; We have taken some time to come up with the scheme and we have also made a cautious start,&nbsp;because this is a scheme that is introduced for the first time.&nbsp; There are improvements and expansion that we can make.&nbsp; But we are also mindful that, even if we do this for the first time, there is also a need for us to be aware that we are also balancing&nbsp;various interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, on the one hand,&nbsp;the interest of the employers who may want to know as much as they need about prospective employees and, of course, the other side of the scale is the interest of the ex-offenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Ahmad Khalis&nbsp;has opined, the law&nbsp;should not be made such that we tell them not to ask certain questions.&nbsp; So how do we go about striking this balance?&nbsp; The other balance, of course, is the concern of society and the interest of the ex-offender.&nbsp; Just like we did for the Home Detention Scheme where we started small, and after operating the scheme for four to five years, we expanded it recently.&nbsp; I think it is right for us to, as we introduce the scheme, start on the spent regime platform and then we will review.&nbsp; We also review the experience of other countries that have the expunging approach like the UK and see whether we should expand.&nbsp; So that is my first point to Ms Indranee Rajah which is linked to the fact that to get this scheme fully off the ground, there is a need for us to engage employers, and that MHA certainly will do together with the Ministry of Manpower and specifically <p align=left>Column: 693<p>reaching out to the Singapore National&nbsp;Employers' Federation, which Ms Indranee Rajah has spoken about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I am very happy to report that there are indeed many enlightened employers out there.&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis has talked about his involvement in SCORE.&nbsp;&nbsp;He would therefore know that SCORE has a database which, over the years, has multiplied.&nbsp; And last year, there were some 1,400 employers on the list, up about 25% from the year before.&nbsp; So that is what we will continue to do, ie, to engage employers, bearing in mind that, like Mr Ahmad Khalis has quite rightly said, if the employers are so minded to find out everything about the employees, whatever way we frame the legislation, they will try to get round it by asking very specific pointed questions other than they have a conviction. Even if we remove the expunge regime, they may try to skirt that just by asking simply, "Have you ever been jailed or fined before?".&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to reach out to them as to what we are trying to do and to give reformed ex-offenders a chance at making something&nbsp;of their lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst legislation can facilitate the process, it is definitely not sufficient.&nbsp; That is what Mr Khalis has said.&nbsp; Part of reaching out to employers, of&nbsp;course, is to let them know that it is in the law that if the employee answers truthfully that he does not have a criminal record because he has checked the portal and his record has been spent,&nbsp;therefore, he is telling the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not misrepresenting the truth.&nbsp; The employer cannot subsequently thereafter, if he discovers that this fellow had been convicted and has a record, dismiss him on that ground alone.&nbsp; But I think Mdm Halimah, having worked with the unions and workers, will know that it may be difficult to pin an employer down if he dismisses an employee because he will not say that he is dismissing the employee because he has discovered that <p align=left>Column: 694<p>truth.&nbsp; He will find other reasons.&nbsp;Mdm Halimah is right that we have to educate employers and, indeed, even employees who feel that they have been victimised, that they can go to MOM and present their cases to MOM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khalis asked about what Government can do.&nbsp; I agree with him entirely.&nbsp; The Government must also show the way.&nbsp; We must also show that we are an enlightened employer.&nbsp; And this has been happening because those of you who have been in the House for some time will know that, over the years, at various COS debates, MHA has been taking questions on this aspect on how to reintegrate ex-offenders and the focus has been on the Government.&nbsp; So I am happy to say that there was a change in 2000.&nbsp; Before that, those with criminal records would only be employed by the civil service with the approval of the Prime Minister's Office, that was before August 2000.&nbsp; But subsequently, autonomy has been given to the Ministries and they have the flexibility to recruit&nbsp;even ex-offenders, taking into account the nature of the offence committed&nbsp;and the nature of the job.&nbsp; I am happy to say that at the latest count, because I asked for the figures, the civil service has recruited more than 50 ex-offenders over the past three years.&nbsp; And on its part, MHA currently employs more than 20 ex-offenders.&nbsp;&nbsp;But numbers do not tell the full story. &nbsp;I think the attitude is also important.&nbsp; So part of the reaching out process of MHA is also to work with the Public Service Division to see and explore how they can&nbsp;reorientate or fine-tune their approach to employing ex-offenders in the light of these amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point that Ms Indranee Rajah&nbsp;asked is what happens to the particulars that have been obtained from the ex-offender -&nbsp;these can be his DNA,&nbsp;records of his fingerprint impressions.&nbsp; As Ms Rajah knows, these are all investigative tools which are internal to the Police.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 695<p>Therefore, even though his record may be marked spent,&nbsp;that is important to him because then it enables him to interact with the outside world as someone who does not have a criminal record.&nbsp; Internally, the Police will continue to keep these records in its database because, after all, the strength of the database for investigation purposes and for identifying possible offenders in future cases is the size of it.&nbsp; These are already particulars in the database which will be kept, but only for that purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other big point that all Members make is the need to reach out to more segments of the society, including Mdm Halimah who talked about public education,&nbsp;whether we could consider having some pamphlets.&nbsp; I think that is an excellent idea.&nbsp; That is something I will ask my officials to look at because some Singaporeans may not be that computer savvy.&nbsp; We&nbsp;have&nbsp;the Police website on the Internet.&nbsp; It is easily accessible.&nbsp; I have looked at what they will put up.&nbsp; There is a long list of FAQs that will explain how this policy will be implemented over time.&nbsp; That is quite good because the details are there.&nbsp; But on top of that, I suppose for many Singaporeans who are not that computer savvy, something like a hard copy will be useful.&nbsp; We will certainly consider that.&nbsp; So let me say that public education will in fact be part of the outreach.&nbsp; Because after all, Singaporeans out there must also understand what is a registrable record, what is a non-registrable record.&nbsp; So they must, for example, look at the Registration of Criminals Act and&nbsp;the Schedules.&nbsp; Even for lawyers,&nbsp;it may not be so easy to fully comprehend and grasp this concept.&nbsp; So that is something that we will educate Singaporeans on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp; the portal is implemented over time, it will be user-friendly.&nbsp; I think that will solve Mdm Halimah's concern&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 696<p>whether it will be easy to check. It will be something where an ex-offender who wants to know more about this practice will be able to access.&nbsp; We will think about the implementation, in terms of confidentiality.&nbsp; That is important too.&nbsp; Here, again, we have to balance accessibility with confidentiality.&nbsp; That is why we are taking some time to work out these details, whether it is sending out the letters,&nbsp;which will be about three to&nbsp;four months' time, or setting up the portal, which&nbsp;will be&nbsp;about eight to nine months' time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other point that Mdm Halimah asked is why the Commissioner for Police has the powers to decide whether or not to let the person who does not qualify under the stated criteria&nbsp;also have his records spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is right because, in implementing this scheme, it flows like this.&nbsp; There are certain criteria that the person must meet, that means, his offence must have attracted a punishment of not more than three months and not more than $2,000, then he must remain crime-free for five years.&nbsp; But the Bill also states certain disqualifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if he has&nbsp;two registrable offences, or if he has got an outstanding&nbsp;warrant of arrest, that also will disentitle him.&nbsp; But having looked at all these barriers, if he feels that notwithstanding that he may not qualify,&nbsp;he wants to make out a case for him to be considered to have his records marked spent, then he will apply to the Commissioner for Police.&nbsp; That is not a new power that the Commissioner has.&nbsp; Actually, there is a parallel, but not quite the same.&nbsp;Currently, under section 7, anybody who has committed an offence under the Second Schedule of the Act -&nbsp;not the First Schedule as it lists out&nbsp;the more serious offences and the punishments are heavier -&nbsp;where it states another set of offences and the punishments are generally lighter,&nbsp;he can actually write to the Commissioner for Police&nbsp;to ask that his record not be entered into by the Criminal Registry<p align=left>Column: 697<p> Office.&nbsp; So it is not a new power that the Police Commissioner exercises.&nbsp; I am sure, as&nbsp;a Police Commissioner, he will exercise it objectively.&nbsp; It is not as though because this man has put the person in prison in the first place, he will be less inclined to allow the application.&nbsp; Because after all, the criteria are also set out in the Act.&nbsp; He looks at the nature of the offence, he looks at the sentence that has been meted out, he looks at the conduct of the applicant subsequent to conviction.&nbsp; So let the Commissioner do his work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to safeguards, Mdm Halimah felt that there are certain professions which are so serious with security implications or with implications impinging on the safety of children that the applicant for a job in that industry should divulge his record.&nbsp; This is, as&nbsp;I have mentioned earlier, the need for balance.&nbsp; That is why, again, the point that I have&nbsp;addressed earlier, as to&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah's question. Why&nbsp;do we not go straight into the expunging regime?&nbsp; Because we are mindful that we have to convince Singaporeans that the scheme will also take into account their concerns of&nbsp;safety and&nbsp;we will balance them accordingly. The screening process that has been in place for professions which have security implications, for example, security guards, or for professionals in the teaching profession, ie, pre-school teachers, that will still be in place.&nbsp; It is not going to be thrown out just because we have this scheme.&nbsp; This assures Singaporeans that there is a balance.&nbsp; So the screening process will work&nbsp;in tandem with this new spent regime.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>I think I have made all the comments in response to Members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I just want to thank Members for supporting this Bill.&nbsp; But like I have said, if all of us are enlightened, including all Members who are employers, I think we can show the way.&nbsp; Like I have said before, that is just part of the larger movement that is happening in Singapore, <p align=left>Column: 698<p>to give genuine ex-offenders who have reformed a second chance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

Par value is the minimum value ascribed to a share in a company. &nbsp;It is the amount of money that the shareholder holding the said share is statutorily required to pay off for the new share issued to him.&nbsp; The authorised share capital is the maximum amount of share capital which a company is authorised to allot under its Memorandum.&nbsp; Calculation of paid-up share capital, based on par value, is an outdated concept that is no longer relied on by investors and creditors as an accurate proxy of a company's underlying value.&nbsp; In practice, measures, such as earning per share and net tangible asset backing, provide a more accurate guide to the economic value of a company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the concept of par value not an accurate proxy of a company's value, the rule that shares cannot be issued at a discount to par value also serves to prevent a company from raising new funds when the market value of its shares has fallen below par value.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 22 to abolish the concept of authorised share capital, thus removing the upper limit to the number of shares that companies may issue, a limit which serves no prudential purpose.&nbsp; Clause 15 introduces new sections 62A and 62B to abolish the par value concept and provides for the transition provisions for the treatment of share capital.&nbsp; Clause 18 repeals sections 67 to 69F which are no longer applicable as the concepts of share premium and share discount will cease to apply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 700<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shares issued after the abolition date, the measure of liability of a shareholder shall be the consideration agreed to be paid on or price of the shares.&nbsp; This includes the amount that would previously have been classified as share premiums.&nbsp; The notion of issued and paid capital will continue to be relevant even after the abolition of par value, but they will no longer be measured against the par value of shares.&nbsp; Instead, they will be measured against the amount of capital issued and actually paid up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence, ACRA will also amend the Eighth&nbsp;Schedule to the Companies Act shortly.&nbsp; The Eighth Schedule prescribes the requirements for the Annual Return to be submitted by a company having a share capital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Reforming the capital maintenance regime</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also reforms the current capital maintenance regime by introducing greater flexibility to how companies raise and maintain their capital.&nbsp; The Bill seeks to achieve this by:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; introducing an alternative capital reduction regime;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; liberalising financial assistance restrictions;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; reforming the share buy-back regime; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) &nbsp;allowing the redemption of preference shares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now briefly explain each of the amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Alternative capital reduction regime</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a company is required to obtain the High Court's approval before it can reduce its share capital.&nbsp; Clause 28<p align=left>Column: 701<p> introduces new sections 78A to 78K, which would allow companies to reduce their share capital through a special shareholders' resolution, without the need for approval from the Court.&nbsp; Creditors' interests will continue to be protected.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, companies will be required to support the special resolution with a solvency statement, which is a declaration from the company's directors that the company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the company's assets will exceed its liabilities after the transaction. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, public companies undergoing capital reduction will be required to publish in advance in a national newspaper a notice of reduction of share capital, while private companies can choose either to publish the notice in a newspaper or send a notice to inform all their creditors.&nbsp; To provide greater flexibility, the publicity requirements will be provided in the Regulations, with the Minister being statutorily empowered to prescribe other modes or channels of public communication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shareholders' resolution and solvency statement have to be made available for public inspection.&nbsp; Consistent with the existing practice, creditors with valid claims will be allowed to object to the capital reduction if they can show good cause.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Liberalising financial assistance restrictions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, a company is generally prohibited from providing financial assistance to third parties to acquire its own shares, as this might lead to an improper depletion of the company's assets to the detriment of its creditors.&nbsp; Clause 23 liberalises the restrictions on the giving of financial assistance by a company to third parties, if the amount of<p align=left>Column: 702<p> assistance does not exceed 10% of the paid-up capital and the reserves of the company, or if all the shareholders approve the giving of the financial assistance.&nbsp; The financial assistance has to be supported by a solvency statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to feedback that the current statutory formulation relating to financial assistance is unclear, clause 23 amends section 76 of the Companies Act by clarifying that representations, warranties and indemnities given by an issuer or vendor, in good faith and in the ordinary course of commercial dealings, in the context of an offer to the public to subscribe for its shares, will not be construed as financial assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Share buy-back regime</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, share buy-backs can only be funded out of distributable profits. Clause 25 will amend section 76B to allow companies to buy back shares or redeem its preference shares out of profits or paid-up capital.&nbsp; This will provide greater flexibility to the companies.&nbsp; Again, as a safeguard, a solvency statement is needed before a company can fund its share buy-back or redeem its preference shares out of its capital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Introducing the concept of treasury shares</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, all shares repurchased by a company must be cancelled immediately upon re-acquisition by the company.&nbsp; Clause 26 introduces new sections 76H to 76K, which will allow a company to hold re-purchased shares in treasury instead of cancelling them.&nbsp; The introduction of treasury shares will make it easier for companies to restructure their capital through share buy-backs and facilitate any future capital raising without having to issue new shares.&nbsp; As a safeguard against possible abuse, the voting and dividend rights of the re-purchased shares will be suspended so long as these shares are held in treasury.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 703<p><p><I>Liberalising the amalgamation process for companies&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current regime, section 212 of the Companies Act provides for the amalgamation of companies by according the Courts the power to effect a transfer of assets and liabilities of the companies and their undertakings.&nbsp; This provision is however seldom used in practice, given the high costs involved and its restrictive application by the Courts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 49 introduces new sections 215A to 215J to allow amalgamation of companies, including holding companies and their subsidiaries, without a court order.&nbsp; To protect creditors' interests, the amalgamation has to be supported by solvency statements from the directors of each amalgamating company as well as the amalgamated company.&nbsp; As an additional safeguard, the new provision also empowers the Court, on application by a member or creditor of the amalgamating company, to make an order against a proposed amalgamation, eg, directing that the amalgamation proposal must not be effected, if it is satisfied that it would unfairly prejudice a member or a creditor of the amalgamating company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion<br></I>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government will continue to look into implementing the few remaining CLRFC recommendations that require amendments to the Companies Act, such as the recommendation to adopt the UK's statutory restatement of the general principles for directors.&nbsp; We will also continue with our regular review of the provisions in the Companies Act to keep pace with developments.&nbsp; The current amendments will give companies the flexibility to design appropriate capital <p align=left>Column: 704<p>structures which best suit their needs, at a lower cost, provided that there is full disclosure.&nbsp; We have also balanced the granting of flexibility with safeguards.&nbsp; This is consistent with our overall policy to make Singapore a good and progressive place for business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my focus today is on section 76 of the Companies Act, which covers financial assistance.&nbsp; Specifically, my opinion is that this financial assistance clause in the Act is a stumbling block for mergers and acquisitions for both the company that is acquiring, as well as the company that is being acquired.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Action Crucible for Financing&nbsp;of ACE has been looking at improving financing and funding activities, and we have looked at not just direct financing issues but also indirect issues, eg, ways to make an asset work for a company by the company using the asset to raise funds for itself.&nbsp; One of the significant issues that we uncovered was section 76, which makes it very cumbersome for companies to make acquisitions.&nbsp; We already have many struggling companies in Singapore, many of them small companies, and one way out for them to survive is to acquire other companies,&nbsp;merge with others or to get acquired.&nbsp; If we look around, the M&amp;A activities in Singapore are relatively insignificant, compared to more developed economies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is also quite natural for an acquiring company to make use of all the assets that it has at its disposal to finance its activities, and this includes the assets of the company that is being acquired.&nbsp; The way section 76 stands now, this <p align=left>Column: 705<p>constitutes financial assistance and requires a whole series of things to be done before it becomes legal to use the assets of the acquired company for financing the transaction.&nbsp; For many smaller companies, they will have little chance of navigating through some of these processes, and therefore resulting in them not being able to go the M&amp;A route effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My committee therefore felt that there was an urgent need for a revision of section 76 to make it less cumbersome for companies to apply for financial assistance.&nbsp; As I understand it, many countries have either eliminated the issue of financial assistance or made it a lot more flexible, so that companies will not have the restriction of financial assistance as we see it here in Singapore.&nbsp; We made a few recommendations to the Ministry, proposing an amendment to section 76 of the Act.&nbsp; I am glad to note that we have made some progress today which makes the process a little simpler, but I would like to say that the Bill does not go far enough and there are still many issues that restrict the M&amp;A activities and these will still remain with the changes that have been put in place so far.&nbsp; We are missing an opportunity to allow our companies to go the M&amp;A route, something which is very common in most developed economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the first issue is that section 76, which has a general prohibition against companies providing financial assistance directly or indirectly to another company for the acquisition of its shares,&nbsp;still stands with the changes.&nbsp; I actually wish that we could have taken this part out completely and then the section could have focused on some guidelines on how to go about applying for financial assistance for M&amp;A activities.&nbsp; Instead, we continue to use exceptions, as section 76, Part 10, shows.&nbsp; This section calls for the requirement of a special resolution of<p align=left>Column: 706<p> the company and a court approval is still needed.&nbsp; There is also a requirement of unanimous shareholder approval in the new proposed section 76(9B).&nbsp; The whole process</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Of course, the Committee would have preferred that the financial assistance should be left completely as a commercial decision, rather than requiring the process of going to the court and going through special exceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we also made a proposal for a majority decision of the board to be sufficient for an M&amp;A activity where financial assistance is immaterial, ie, less than 10%.&nbsp; But with the changes, we still require an unanimous approval of all directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;This again, for the immaterial type of situation, was something that we could have gone a bit further by taking out the unanimous decision process completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do note that there are some concessions by way of new exceptions like in the event of immaterial financial assistance.&nbsp; (This is the proposed section 76(9A)).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the whole, I feel that the Bill is&nbsp;the first good move. As I have mentioned, we could have gone a lot more further.&nbsp; I do not think this will spur on the M&amp;A activities that we would like to see.&nbsp; Neither is it going to help the acquiring companies to navigate around the financial assistance problems that they are facing.&nbsp; But&nbsp;in anticipation of further changes down the road, as the Minister has mentioned, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B> I would like to thank Mr Inderjit Singh for his comments and also for the work of the ACE's Action Crucible for Financing. They have made recommendations to the Committee, and quite a number of their recommendations have&nbsp;been accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree that we need some flexibility in section 76 and that is why we have introduced this in the current Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 707<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit said that he wished that we could have got rid&nbsp;of section 76 completely.&nbsp; Let me explain why we did not do so. Here, the issue is not just the interest of the acquiring company, for speed, like he has said.&nbsp; But you need to take into the account the interests of two other parties, ie,&nbsp;the shareholders of the acquired company and&nbsp;the creditors of that acquired company.&nbsp; You need to balance this off. What section 76 has done is to seek some form of balance here.&nbsp; This is also reflected in other jurisdictions&nbsp;in Australia, New Zealand and also the United Kingdom. They have that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we have done, in terms of flexibility, is when it comes to less than 10% of the capital, you need a majority decision at the board.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh said that&nbsp;the recommendations put forward should be a majority decision,&nbsp;and we still need an unanimous decision.&nbsp; I just want to clarify that we do not need that anymore.&nbsp; With the amendment now, with a majority decision, you can provide the financial assistance, provided that you&nbsp;have a solvency statement, which you must have.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if it goes beyond 10%,&nbsp;as&nbsp;I have said, there are other interests involved here, ie,&nbsp;the shareholders of the acquired company and the creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Mr Inderjit is quite right that one avenue, which is provided in the existing Act, is to have a special resolution and then court approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have done in the <p align=left>Column: 708<p>amendment is to create another option which&nbsp;will help small companies.&nbsp; Basically, the option allows a small company, where all the shareholders agree,&nbsp;they can go ahead and provide the financial assistance.&nbsp; You do not have to go to court or to get a special resolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Mr Inderjit has said, this is the first step. We will continue to monitor this and review it.&nbsp; And as&nbsp;Members know, we have regular reviews of the Companies Act.&nbsp; We will see how, in terms of business efficacy, this latest set of amendments will help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr&nbsp;Raymond Lim Siang Keat].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									       		<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      					<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT--><p align=left>Column: 708<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>ADJOURNMENT<BR></B></span><div><BR>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed."&nbsp; - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</p><p align="right">Nine Minutes to Seven o'clock pm</p><p align="right">to a date to be fixed.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM--><p align=left>Column: 709<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM</P></span></B></div>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:WARD AND HOSPITAL CHARGES--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>WARD AND HOSPITAL CHARGES</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

So far, increases in petrol pump prices have been moderated by domestic competition between petrol pump operators. Premium petrol prices increased by 2.9% in April 2005 compared to a year ago. For commercial vehicles and buses that run on diesel, the cost increase has been more significant, as diesel prices have risen by 31% over the past year (from $0.67 per litre in April 2004 to $0.88 per litre in April 2005).<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the power sector, 35% of electricity is generated from steam plants that use fuel oil, and 65% from plants that use natural gas. Natural gas price is also indexed to fuel oil price. From April 2004 to April 2005, power generation companies faced an increase of about 15% in the cost of fuel. Fuel costs account for about 50% of electricity tariffs. Through competition, electricity tariffs have only increased by 1.7% over the same period. However, with rising fuel oil price, it would be unrealistic to expect tariffs to remain at the current level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With today's technology, using gas turbines for power generation is still the most cost effective solution in Singapore. Some research is being done on the viability of solar energy, in the form of photovoltaic cells; but at current technology levels, this will cost about five times as much in electricity tariffs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 711<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are cheaper technology solutions, the electricity market is designed to allow power generation companies to adopt them. These companies will have an incentive to do so, as it will help them to better compete for market share. By remaining open to new technologies and investors with new electricity generation methods, we can ensure a competitive market that will adopt the most cost-effective fuel solution. This will translate to lower electricity tariffs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this period of high oil prices, it becomes all the more important that we adopt good energy conservation practices. Industries should consider conducting energy audits and implementing energy conservation measures. The National Environment Agency recently launched an Energy Efficiency Improvement Assistance Scheme (EASE), which companies can tap on to engage expert consultants to audit their energy consumption and recommend measures to save energy. Consumers should also be more conscious about using energy-efficient electrical appliances. This include opting for energy-labelled air- conditioners and refrigerators, energy-saving lights, choosing the correct capacity of air-conditioner and refrigerator, and enabling "energy-saver" modes in their computers.&nbsp; More information on energy conservation practices at home is available from the National Energy Efficiency Committee website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 711<p>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:UNWED MOTHERS--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>UNWED MOTHERS</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong </B>asked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether a more open and caring Singapore society includes single unwed mothers and their children and, if so, what fiscal policy measures are in store to help such mothers cope with the difficulties of single parenting.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Hsien Loong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government cannot, and should not, be a surrogate father or family to replace the missing fathers or families who should be supporting these single unwed mothers.

They can qualify for maternity leave and childcare leave under the Employment Act, and are eligible for infantcare and childcare subsidies.

These are a minimum annual income of $30,000 to qualify for a credit card and a maximum credit limit of twice the cardholder's monthly income. Some amendments were made to give flexibility to card issuers and choice to cardholders without compromising the fundamental objective.&nbsp; However, these amendments do not make it easier for Singaporeans to obtain credit.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Ong is concerned with the $2.6 billion rollover balance of Singaporeans.&nbsp; In fact, the growth in rollover balance has slowed in the last few years. It grew by 3% in 2004.&nbsp; We have also looked at the rate of credit card defaults<sup>1</sup>, which is a better indicator of whether cardholders are spending beyond their means.&nbsp; On this measure, the adjusted charge-off rates for Singapore averaged at 5% between 2002 and 2004<sup>2</sup> .&nbsp; This is comparable to that in other countries.&nbsp; It is in fact lower than the average charge-off rate in Hong Kong<sup>3&nbsp;</sup> which was 9% during the same period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Ong asked about the measures in place to ensure that financial institutions conduct proper checks on applicants for various credit facilities. Banks and other credit card issuers are required to comply with MAS' regulations on credit cards, including obtaining documentary evidence of applicants' incomes. We conduct periodic inspections to ensure compliance with these requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have rules in place to curb the easy availability of credit, Singaporeans have to take personal responsibility for their finances and ensure that they do not incur debt in excess of their ability to repay.&nbsp; That is why the MAS and other Government agencies have been working with industry and community organisations on the MoneySENSE national financial education programme, which aims to help Singaporeans acquire the skills and knowledge to better manage their finances.&nbsp; MAS will continue to work with the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) to educate consumers on the consequences of late payment on credit cards, and how penalties and late interest charges are computed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the efforts of MoneySENSE and other similar programmes, we hope to help Singaporeans manage their finances proactively and use credit responsibly.<br></p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><sup><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">1</span></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is defined as bad debts written off expressed as a percentage of average rollover balance for the quarter.<br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><sup><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">2</span></sup>&nbsp; Source: MAS Credit and Charge Card Statistics<br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><sup><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt">3&nbsp;</span></sup> &nbsp;Source: Hong Kong Monetary Authority</p><BR></div></P></div><p align=left>Column: 717<p>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:FOREIGN MAID LEVY RELIEF--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>FOREIGN MAID LEVY RELIEF</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.
