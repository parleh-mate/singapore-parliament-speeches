<div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  before  the  commencement  of  public

business,  in  view of the requirements  of  Standing

Order No. 7, and in view of the possibility that  the

business  of the House will be completed by the  time

the moment of interruption is reached, I now move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly at its rising today do adjourn

to Tuesday, the 24th of May next.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of Government to give hon.

Members  an opportunity to debate public business  as

far as possible

every month.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> I rise to

second.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly at its rising today do adjourn

to Tuesday, the 24th of May next.

<div align="center"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is, of

course, the possibility that Members of the House may

wish  to  have  more  time to  debate  certain  vital

matters  which are before the House today, and  I  do

not wish it to be understood that I am trying to push

business  through  or to limit the time  which  every

hon.  Member  is  entitled  to  for  the  purpose  of

debating  both this motion now before the  House  and

other  motions that will be coming before it. In  the

circumstances,  Sir,  I  should  like  to  adopt  the

procedure  whereby  if  at the  time  the  moment  of

interruption is reached the business of the House  is

not  completed,  then the House  should  continue  in

session  until  business  is completed.  Accordingly,

Sir,  I  should  like  to move  a  motion  under  the

provisions of Standing Order No. 7 (11), but before I

can  do so, Sir, I find that under the provisions  of

Standing Order No. 23 I must obtain both your consent

and  the  general assent of the hon. Members of  this

Assembly.  I  now  seek your consent,  Sir,  for  the

purpose  of  moving a motion under the provisions  of

Standing Order No. 7 (11),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings of this day's business,

standing  on  the Order Paper, be exempted  from  the

provisions of Standing Order No. 7.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Standing Order No. 23, hon. Members, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notice shall not be dispensed with in the case of a

motion ...except with the consent of the  Speaker  and

the general assent of Members present."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Order referred to by the Chief

Minister,   providing  for  suspension  of   Standing

Orders, requires notice. I have no objection. I  give

my  consent that notice be dispensed with. Have I the

assent of the Members that that should be so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am obliged to you and the

House,  Sir. In the circumstances, Sir,  I  do  move,

under the provisions of Standing Order No. 7 (11),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings of this day's business,

standing  on  the Order Paper, be exempted  from  the

provisions of Standing Order No. 7.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings of this day's business,

<div align="center"><b>DEBATE ON THE GOVERNOR'S ADDRESS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on Question [26th April, 1955],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly expresses its thanks to His

Excellency the Governor for his Address delivered  on

Friday, 22nd April, 1955."- (The Chief Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

the  adjournment yesterday I was speaking  about  the

fears  of  slum  and attap dwellers who  have  to  be

ejected  from their places of habitation to make  way

for  public  housing, and we are now very  concerned,

particularly when His Excellency the Governor in  his

Address to this Assembly says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... and the clearance of slum areas is a challenge

which  the Government appreciates can only be met  by

the   most   vigorous  and  in  some  cases   drastic

measures."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent last Sunday with 400 odd people living in 40

houses in the Paya Lebar area on whom notices to quit

within  one month have been served. Some were offered

alternative  resettlement in Jurong,  14  miles  away

from  where they are living at present, but  most  of

them were told that they would have to find their own

accommodation.  Well, I ask you, Sir,  how  are  they

going  to  find accommodation in one month?  I  admit

they knew these things were coming when the land  was

acquired  some two years ago, but, as we  know  human

nature,  one always hopes for the best; and now  they

are  suddenly  faced with this terrible problem.  The

compensation offered was inadequate, hardly enough to

pay  for  half  a hut, let alone cover  the  cost  of

removal  and rehabilitation. I am sure if  the  Chief

Minister  had  seen the misery of  these  people,  he

would have spoken with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



much  more  feeling than he had yesterday.  He  would

probably  have described their feelings of resentment

as fumes from hell instead of the slag-heap. Now I am

sure  that  this  Government will immediately  change

this  policy  and extend to these unfortunate  people

and  to the very, very many more who are about to  be

evicted  the benevolence so well described  in  their

Four-year Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore move the following amendment to be

inserted after the words "drastic measures." at  line

5,  page  6 (line 8, column 8 of the Official Report)

of His Excellency's Address:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In clearing slums and attap dwellings for public

housing,  or  public  works  like  the  international

airport,    Government   will   provide   alternative

accommodation-"



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. I would ask

you, Sir, whether the hon. Member is entitled to move

an  amendment  to  the Address. As I  understand  the

procedure,  Sir, he is entitled to move an  amendment

to  the  motion, which is a motion of thanks for  the

Address.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was going to raise that question

myself,  Mr  Chief Minister. I was waiting  for  the

Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck) to complete

his submission. Mr Lim Koon Teck, will you carry on?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In clearing slums and attap dwellings for public

housing,  or  public  works  like  the  international

airport,    Government   will   provide   alternative

accommodation and land for farmers and assist in  the

rehabilitation of the people who have  to  be  moved,

due  regard being given to the proximity of the place

of employment."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have that amendment in writing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment, hon. Members, seeks to

amend   His  Excellency's  Address  as  an   Address.

Standing Orders provide that amendments can  only  be

amendments  to  motions, and the  motion  before  the

Assembly is, "That this Assembly expresses its thanks

to His Excellency the Governor for his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



Address delivered on Friday, 22nd April, 1955."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice, I might point out, is that any

amendment to that kind of a motion will have to be an

amendment  directed at the policy of the  Government,

so that if there had been an amendment, shall we say,

to  add  the  words, "But this Assembly  regrets  the

Government does not see fit to do this, that  or  the

other",  then I could have allowed it,  but  in  this

particular   case  I  am  afraid  the  amendment   is

inadmissible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, in that case, then I move

this  as  an  amendment to the motion  of  the  Chief

Minister,  that  while  we  accept  with  thanks  His

Excellency the Governor's Address, we regret that his

Address has caused some consternation to a section of

the  people  and  that  such fears  be  redressed  or

removed by the amendment I have just handed

in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have that completely in writing,

please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

clarification,  Sir.  Has  the  Chair  accepted  that

amendment? I must confess for myself that I  find  it

difficult    to   understand   what   was   intended. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, here is the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will you read it out, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I ask for an amendment to be made to the motion, to add at the end of the motion



<br><br>"but  regrets that no mention has been  made  in  the

Address   of   measures  to  be  adopted   concerning

clearance  of slums and attap dwellers, and provision

of  adequate alternative housing and cost of  removal

and rehabilitation of those who have to be moved".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I admit it, Mr Lim Koon Teck.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the amendment to the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be added, be there added."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I rise to support

the amended motion. Originally I intended to speak on

this  subject,  as in the past two or  three  months,

many  of the electorate in my constituency have  been

threatened  with  notices to  quit,  and  as  far  as

possible I have been in consultation with those land-

owners who served such notices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we have the Rent Control Ordinance,

which  is  very feeble indeed and does not offer  any

assistance  to  these tenants who are being  evicted.

The  Ordinance  states that the Court may  decide  in

accordance with the hardship suffered by the  people,

but  then  we  all  know that there  is  no  specific

direction in the manner in which the matter has to be

treated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nearly 90 per cent of the

electorate  in the Seletar constituency  do  live  on

private estates. They do not own any land at all.  If

they are farmers or if they are in other occupations,

they  depend entirely on the generosity of the  land-owners.  Vast  developments are taking place  in  the

rural   areas   and  these  tenants  are   completely

helpless. We cannot obstruct development, but at  the

same  time we cannot see these tenants suffer in  any

way. I feel that the Government should have made some

recommendations,  or  at  least  indicated  what  its

policy would be on matters of this nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally have inspected those houses which are

affected by the notices and have seen for myself  the

hardship  suffered  by  these people.  I  thought  of

seeing  the Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat) soon after

this  sitting was over. But since this amended motion

has  been  put  forward, I take  the  opportunity  of

expressing  my  views  on  this  matter.  I  am   not

suggesting that any immediate reply should  be  given

at  this sitting, but I urge that this amended motion

be   accepted   and  the  Government  make   suitable

enquiries  into  the possibilities of  helping  these

people.  It  is  all well and good to  allot  them  a

specific area miles away from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



the  places where they have lived for many years, but

those resettlement camps have not proved to be a very

congenial place for the tenants to live in. They have

no  proper roads, no lights and no water, and nothing

to  suit  the  lively atmosphere of these  people.  I

would  urge  the Government's immediate attention  to

this  matter,  and, therefore, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I

support this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wonder  whether  the Member for Paya Lebar  (Mr  Lim

Koon Teck) has read sufficiently clearly that part of

the Governor's Address to understand the meaning that

is   intended  to  be  conveyed;  that  part  of  the

Governor's   Address   to  which   he   referred - "the

Government  appreciates that this  challenge  to  the

Government  in  the interests of attap  dwellers  and

other  poorer people must be met by the most vigorous

and in some cases drastic measures".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he reads that carefully I think it will appear

quite clearly to him that the "drastic measures"  are

not  intended  to mean drastic measures  against  the

poor  people  by giving them notice to quit - to  clear

from their permanent homes or temporary homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front has many achievements, but today it

seems  its greatest achievement is the conversion  of

many  members of the public, who have no  Socialistic

ideas  in their heads, to take interest on behalf  of

the poor people. For this reason only, Sir, I rise to

oppose  the amendment to this motion. It is  a  clear

misunderstanding of the Governor's Address.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, knowing the

Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck), I am quite

certain  he has not used this amendment for  purposes

of political manoeuvre which, on the face of it, does

carry  every indication of that intent, because  what

the  hon. Member Mr R. C. H. Lim has said, it  seems

to me, is accurate. If I may read to hon. Members who

have   not   had  the  opportunity  of  seeing   this

amendment - it regrets that "no mention has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



been  made  in the Address of measures to be  adopted

concerning clearance of slums and attap dwellers".  I

will  take  the  second  part  afterwards  with   the

conjunctive "and".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is no question, Sir, of the Government

wishing  to clear out attap dwellers, but as  regards

the  measures to be adopted concerning slums,  may  I

read  again  for the benefit of those who  only  read

while running? This is what His Excellency said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The imperative and pressing need for adequate

housing   for  those  in  the  lower  income   group,

including  the solution of the problem of  the  attap

dwellers  and  the  clearance  of  slum  areas  is  a

challenge which the Government appreciates  can  only

be met by the most vigorous and in some cases drastic

measures."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is the clearance of the slum areas, not the

slum  dwellers, that calls for drastic  measures.  It

must  be obvious from the tenor of the entire Address

that  this is not aimed at the dwellers, but  at  the

areas  for the assistance of the dwellers. And we  go

on, Sir, as regards the measures:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the firm intention of the Government to find

the  solution to this problem and in doing so it will

in the future place more emphasis on the provision of

public  housing at the lowest possible cost  even  if

this means some lowering of standards."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one measure for the clearance of slums - the

provision of extremely low-cost housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the amendment adds - it also regrets that we

have  not mentioned provision of adequate alternative

housing  and  cost of removal and rehabilitation.  It

seems  to be taken for granted by the mover  of  this

amendment,   and   those  who   support   him,   that

Government,   far  from  seeking  to  alleviate   the

distress  of the slum dwellers, seeks to evict  them.

That  is a wholly false reading of the passage. There

is  no  question of seeking drastic measures  against

the  dwellers, but seeking drastic measures  for  the

purpose  of  demolishing those places and  rebuilding

them and putting back the original dwellers as far as

possible  into those homes. Sir, this has been  flung

at  us again and again from the opposite side of  the

House. If you will permit me, I should like to read a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



passage from it myself, from the Four-year Programme

of the Labour Front concerning the slums:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Labour Front believes that no slum problem can

be solved by the mere provision of more houses. While

the provision of better homes is an important feature

of  slum clearance, there are other vitally important

factors  which must be considered in any resettlement

plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disregard of these factors has been the cause of

the Colony's failure to get rid of its slums.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front's plan for clearing the slums is to

deal  with  each area as a composite population  unit

and  to  accommodate the slum dwellers  in  healthier

surroundings as one composite unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will call for a careful study of the human

ecology  of  each  slum area. It must  be  known  why

people  choose  to  remain in an  area  under  living

conditions that are unhealthy and dangerous and which

they  themselves  obviously do not like  rather  than

move to homes that are healthier and better serviced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front believes that an important reason

for  this attachment to such surroundings is that the

people  work or earn their livelihood by catering  to

the  needs of the communal unit which they have built

around themselves over a period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask these people to move to a new area, however

congenial  it may be, without also moving  with  them

the  little trades, industries and occupations  which

provide  their  livelihood and their  recreation,  is

disastrous to any slum improvement plan."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we come, Sir, to the possibilities that open

before us today:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A vast open area close to the centre of the city

falls  vacant very soon around Kallang Airport.  This

area  ought  to  be developed into  a  vast  `transit

camp',  with the purpose of accommodating temporarily

the  entire population of a defined slum area pending

the demolition and rebuilding on modern lines of that

particular area. Thus, an entire population  of,  let

us  say  area  'A' will go to Kallang Airport  for  a

short  time,  and then return to their original  area

'A'  after  it has been rebuilt for them  with  every

modern  facility. No permanent dislocation  can  take

place in this way."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is along those lines that we

are now seeking to find a solution to the question of

slums,  and I must confess it is with regret  that  I

see   an  amendment  which  seeks  to  twist, quite

unintentionally I am sure, seeing the personality  of

the mover of that amendment, but which, nevertheless,

twists  the  simple  meaning  of  the  Address   into

something vicious and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



violent,  aimed  against the interests  of  the  slum

dwellers.  It  would indeed be appreciated,  Sir,  if

this  explanation can be accepted and  the  amendment

withdrawn.  I  can  see  no useful  purpose  that  it

serves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar (Mr M. P. D. Nair) has

indicated that there should be, with reference to the

tenants  of private land-owners, a further protection

for the poor tenant, and he has also indicated it was

his  hope  to  see the Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and Housing as soon as this sitting was  over.

May  I  say, on behalf of my colleague, that  such  a

visit  would  be  welcome and that  the  constructive

suggestions  which are contained in his speech  would

be  carefully considered? But that is not part of the

amendment  really, Sir, the question of the amendment

of  the  Control of Rent Restriction Ordinance.  This

amendment  arises  out of an entire misconception  of

the  meaning of the paragraph at the top  of  page  6

(second   paragraph,  column  8,  of  the   Official

Report).   The  drastic  measures  we  envisage   are

measures  of a character whereby we seek  to  acquire

vested  landlord  interests in slum  areas,  for  the

purpose  of  demolishing those  unhealthy  units  and

rebuilding thereon premises which are fit  for  human

habitation.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

motion  before  the House is to thank His  Excellency

the  Governor  for  his Address. His  Excellency  the

Governor  has, only in broad outline,  given  us  the

policy   which  his  Government  will   follow.   The

Opposition  is  not bound to that  policy.  They  may

differ  in many ways. There are many points on  which

they may differ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally I would suggest that the Opposition, who

does  not like this Address, can either vote  against

it  or abstain. When the policy is being carried  out

by the government in power now - I do not know how long

it  will  remain in power - the Opposition  can  either

bring  or  oppose  a  motion when  it  comes  as  the

business goes on. Personally I would like to abstain.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members will probably feel just as

hot  as  I  am.  I  am told that  there  has  been  a

breakdown  in  the air-conditioning  plant,  and  the

Public  Works  Department are trying  their  best  to

remedy  it. Meanwhile I think it would be appropriate

if  we  suspend proceedings for half an hour.  It  is

getting too hot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before

embarking  on the topics in His Excellency's  Address

to  which I wish to devote special attention, I  want

to  answer  some of the points made by  hon.  Members

yesterday.  I  would first like to refer,  with  some

surprise, to the attack made by the Member for Queenstown  (Mr Lee Choon Eng) on the Member for Serangoon

(Mr  Lim  Choon Mong) for daring to make a reference

to  the subject of hawkers. May I remind him that the

City  Council  is  not  the only  authority  in  this

matter, because hawkers also exist in the rural areas

and the Rural Board is at present under the authority

of  Government? The Member for Serangoon has, I  know

full  well,  done  a lot of practical  work  for  the

welfare  of  hawkers, and has recently acquired  land

for the shelter in Upper Serangoon Village of many of

those living in his own constituency. I hope that the

Member for Queenstown will have no objection to that;

nor  if  I take, as in fact I have taken, an interest

in  the  hawker  problem in the rural  areas  of  the

Tanglin  constituency outside the West Ward area  for

which he is City Councillor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown then launched himself into

an  unsubstantiated attack on the Progressive  Party,

alleging  that  it  had always  been  obstructive  to

hawkers  in the City Council. May I suggest  that  he

give examples of the allegations at the next ordinary

meeting of the City Council, as he claims that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



that  is the right and proper place for consideration

of  such  matters? In point of fact, as I believe  as

far  as  possible  in sticking to facts,  the  Health

Committee of the City Council has, I understand,  two

Progressive and two Labour Front members, the  latter

being  both  hon.  Members in this  House.  The  hon.

Member  has therefore had an equal chance to get  his

policies adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that during the course of this debate

a  number of hon. Members have, to the huge amusement

of themselves, enjoyed using the Progressive Party as

an  Aunt Sally, attributing to it all the ills,  real

and   imaginary,  which  they  consider  beset   this

country.  It  is as well to remind them of  one  more

fact. The Progressives were not the party in power in

the last Government, but a small minority of six in a

House  of  25.  Despite  this handicap,  an  enormous

advance  has been made in our social services through

our  efforts, which has made Singapore  the  envy  of

many  countries.  What  the  people  want  more  than

anything is more schools, more medical services, more

jobs.   Let   us   see  whether  the  Labour-Alliance

Government with a]l the power in its hands, or almost

all  the  power, can do all that much better  in  the

next   four  years  than  the  so-called  Progressive

Government has done in the past four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further truth, unpalatable though it may be to

some  hon. Members, is that the vast change from  the

Advisory   Council  of  eight  years   ago   to   the

constitution  of  today,  which  the  Chief  Minister

pronounces as workable, would not have been  achieved

so smoothly or so speedily if it had not been for the

hard  work  put  in  by the Progressive  Party  while

others stood aside and looked on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes, the Minister for Labour and

Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock) was there, but it was  not

he  who  moved for an increase in the elected members

which led to the present constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I did.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Coconuts may be hurled by hon. Members intoxicated with success today, but let them beware



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



lest those same coconuts turn into boomerangs in  the years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us get back to an examination of some of

Government's  proposals. My first  wish  is  to  give

consideration  to the proposals on education,  and  I

must  state with regret that the nebulous  nature  of

the proposals gives us some misgivings. In the Labour

Front  pamphlet to which so much reference  has  been

made, we read the following two sentences:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Labour Front's Policy on education is free

compulsory schooling for all children, in English  or

vernacular  schools, for the first  six  years  as  a

matter of first priority. Thereafter scholarships  or

grants may be provided in deserving cases."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all. The only merit in the Government's new

proposals  is  that three sentences  have  taken  the

place of two, but nevertheless they do not make us 50

per  cent  the wiser and certainly have  neither  the

sweep  nor the comprehension of the Progressive Party

proposals  in  our programme. I wish  to  examine  it

sentence by sentence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first states that "the policy of the Government

is  to aim at equal treatment for all schools and all

teachers  in those schools". As the Member for  Tiong

Bahru  (Mr William Tan) has already said,  obviously

we  require clarification of this statement before we

can  accept  it  as  more than justifying  its  high-sounding  phrase.  Does it mean that  the  Government

will  give  equal grants-in-aid to all  the  schools,

which  we  will welcome, or that it will  bear  equal

expenditure  per pupil in all schools? Does  it  mean

that   there   would  be  equal  salary  scales   and

allowances  to  married teachers as to single,  women

teachers  as  to  men, English teachers  in  Chinese,

Tamil  and  Malay  schools as in  Government  English

schools?  No  doubt the Minister for  Education  will

enlighten  us  on his plans before the  end  of  this

debate.  But  I would like to bring to his  attention

one of the many inequalities which undoubtedly exist.

I   refer   to  the  disparity  between  the  special

allowances  granted  to married and  to  single  lady

teachers.  It is the present practice for  principals

and  specialists, that is teachers, teaching  special

subjects, to receive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



special  allowances; but whereas unmarried women  get

the  full allowance, married women get only half  the

allowance.  I  can  see  no  valid  reason  why,  for

example,  a  principal who is married and having  the

responsibility  of  running a  girls'  school  should

receive  half  the allowance payable to an  unmarried

principal.  I  hope that the Minister  for  Education

will  look into this matter at an early date, for  if

it is the type of inequality which the Government has

in  mind  to  remove, it will have our  whole-hearted

support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now go on to the second sentence:



<br><br>"The  foundation stone of the policy will be  a  six-year  course  of  free  primary  education  for   all

children." The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan

Yew) has already remarked that the phrase "compulsory

schooling  for  all children" which  appears  in  the

Labour   Front's   platform  has  been   conveniently

dropped.  The  elementary principle that  you  cannot

have  compulsory  education unless there  are  enough

schools  for all children of school age,  appears  to

have  been  learnt very quickly after the elections,

and  surely  there is a difference between  education

for all children and compulsory education. The former

implies education for all children who wish to  avail

themselves  of  going to school. The  latter  implies

legislation compelling parents to send their children

to    school.    And   so   this   statement    fails

disappointingly   short  of  the  Progressive   Party

programme  by  failing to state that  education  will

start  from the age of six. It has been a  matter  of

regret  that the age of admission to primary  schools

in the previous Government has been tending to change

from  six years to seven years, and indeed  it  is  a

fact  that  even  children of seven years  have  been

unable  to gain admission. One would have hoped  that

one  of  the  earliest acts of the present Government

would  be  to give an assurance that they  will  take

early steps to banish this tendency, and I hope that

the Minister for Education will give us an assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from technical education, which I will deal

with  in a moment, the Government statement,  as  did

its election programme, now falls into ominous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



silence. One of the biggest problems is how to bridge

the  gap  between the age of 12 at  the  end  of  the

primary stage and the age of 14, the earliest age  at

which  young  persons are allowed to work  under  the

Labour Ordinance as it stands today and I hope as  it

will  be  proposed in future. Education clearly  must

not  stop at the six-year course unless a student  is

found to be absolutely unfit to continue his studies.

The  Progressive  Party policy is quite  definite  on

this  point.  The  poor bright  boys  must  have  the

benefit of secondary education for two years, or  two

years trade and junior technical education free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This takes us on to secondary education as a whole,

which  the  Government statement fails to mention  at

all.   We  agree  that  primary  education   is   the

foundation,  but  it is like putting  your  essential

piling  in below ground. You get nothing to show  for

your money till the real structure above ground, from

the  age  of  12,  starts appearing.  If  we  are  to

continue  to provide the country with local  men  and

women  who can take control of the higher grades  not

only  of the public service but also of all the other

spheres  of  life  in  the  country,  then  secondary

education must not be neglected in the way  in  which

the  Government  intends  to  do,  as  shown  in  the

statement  of  policy.  Indeed,  the  policy  of  the

previous  Government was to build one  secondary  for

every  five  or six primary schools, and  this  still

stands,  unfortunately, today.  Does  the  Government

think this is enough, or will it improve the ratio as

it  must if it is to turn out a sufficient number  of

well-educated young men and women fit to serve  their

country,  and  if it is to find sufficient  competent

teachers  to  man  the schools, one of  the  greatest

problems of all?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pass now to the final sentence of the Government

statement: "Technical education. . . will be expanded

as   rapidly   as  possible  and  the   question   of

apprenticeship and training of industrial workers and

clerks   will   be   studied  at  an   early   date."

Apprenticeship and training of industrial workers  is

of  course  of  paramount importance and  is  already

being  tackled.  The first task is to  attract  young

people  into  trades, and surely a Labour  Government

worthy of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



name  should  be best fitted for this.  The  test  is

close  at  hand. I would draw attention to  the  fact

that during the current week enrolment in the evening

classes  in  16  subjects has started in  the  Junior

Technical  School, which starts its school year  next

week.  Can we be sure that all these 16 classes  will

be filled up? If they are, then a big hurdle has been

cleared  and  all we have to do is to double,  triple

and quadruple these as soon as possible. If not, what

steps  will  the  Minister  take  in  this  important

matter? But while technical training at this level is

essential for economic development, as my hon. Friend

the  Member for Serangoon has himself said, we  would

have  expected the Government statement  to  make  at

least  a  passing  reference to new schemes  for  the

training of professional men to take the place of the

technical experts who, under the new policy, will  no

longer  be recruited from overseas. There is  a  wide

gap between the declared policy of stopping overseas

recruitment and the practical aspects of it. I am not

suggesting that the policy is a wrong one but  it  is

common  sense,  having stated a  policy,  to  suggest

remedies for the problems arising from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving aside today university education which is

not,  after  all,  under the direct  control  of  the

Government,  I  can only sum up by  saying  that  the

Government  statement is extremely disappointing  and

certainly  not very ambitious and does not appear  to

have  taken into consideration the careful  balancing

required between the different stages of education if

the  greatest good of the greatest number of students

is  to be brought about. The present is an indication

that the Government will devote its main attention to

100 per cent attendance at primary schools only. Such

a  bottom-heavy  policy, if  I  may  be  allowed  the

expression,  would  be disastrous,  would  be  deeply

resented by the people, and would be strongly opposed

by  the  Progressive Party. Large reserves  of  money

have  been  built  up  in  the  last  few  years  for

expansion  of  education which the new Government  is

very  fortunate indeed to have inherited. It  is  our

duty, as Members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



the  Opposition,  not only to  see  that  it  is  not

squandered but that it is wisely spent to benefit all

stages of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to an examination of the Government

proposals  regarding the medical services  which  are

also  treated  in  three short sentences.  There  is

nothing  new  in  the plan for expansion  of  medical

services in the rural areas and the establishment  of

district  hospitals and clinics. Nobody  can  quarrel

with  that,  but what I find disturbing is  that  the

Government appears - I may be wrong - to be modifying and

reducing  the  Medical Plan already approved  and  in

part  implemented, and has not gone  as  far  as  the

Progressive Party programme. The plan of the previous

Government  was  to provide ten cottage  or  district

hospitals,  five on the outskirts of the  urban  area

and  five in the rural area, one of each being  under

contemplation   in   1955,   perhaps   still    under

contemplation,  and  we  presume  that  the   present

Government has taken over the scheme lock, stock  and

barrel.  But  what  we  look  for  in  vain  is   any

indication  that  there will  be  a  policy  of  real

decentralisation  of the medical  services,  although

this was categorically promised in the Labour Front's

Four-year  Programme. Everybody knows that  too  much

has  been concentrated in the General Hospital  area.

That is why the Progressive Party, unlike the present

Government, has advocated the building at once of one

district General Hospital with as many divisions  for

diagnosis  and  treatment as  exist  in  the  General

Hospital,  and that this hospital should be  situated

somewhere in the Katong-Geylang area where  there  is

concentrated  the largest suburban population.  Apart

from  the  medical facilities it would offer  to  the

people,  it  would give a chance to our  young  local

doctors  to climb the tree more quickly to specialist

posts and provide the necessary encouragement to  the

much  needed recruitment of more of such  doctors  to

Government service. We would like to see an immediate

step taken to put a stop to any further expansion  of

the  medical  services in the General  Hospital  area

except  what is absolutely essential so that  a  very

early start can be made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



in decentralisation. We therefore view the Government

statement with misgivings, as unrealistic and falling

short of their promises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the setting up of a Medical Advisory

Council,  while  this  may be an  admirable  move  in

theory,  we  hope that in practice it will  not  mean

more talk, more memoranda and less action on the main

principles of development of the medical services. We

hope indeed that it will put first things first,  and

the  consideration  of  the National  Health  Service

Scheme second. This scheme is also vague, and  I  had

hopes  that the Minister for Health, who has  already

spoken, would have elaborated on this point.  Is  the

National  Health Service to be contributory - that  is,

will people pay for it out of their weekly or monthly

salaries?   If  so,  is  Government  under-estimating

public resistance in such matters? If not, then it is

no different from the present system and is merely  a

piece  of  Labour  Front bluff. The  present  medical

services  are  free today, right up to and  including

operations by the leading specialists, to  those  who

cannot afford to pay. If it is intended to draft  all

private practitioners into a state service, then  the

first  task of the Government is to tackle  the  main

problem  of which no mention has been made, that  is,

for  the provision of more doctors. I believe that  I

am  correct in saying that there are at present  only

450 doctors in Singapore, 55 per cent of whom are  in

Government  service  and  45  per  cent  in   private

practice, representing roughly one for 2,667 persons,

as  against  one for 1,100 in the United Kingdom.  At

this moment there are many vacancies unfilled in  the

Government  medical services. Whether the  number  is

about  30 or very much more, I must confess I am  not

certain.  The average total output of the Faculty  of

Medicine  is  about 60 per year, of which  one  would

expect  two-thirds  to go to the Federation  and  the

balance  of  20  to Singapore, though I  believe  the

ratio is rather more in favour of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would further emphasise two points. The present

Government's   intention  is   to   stop   expatriate

recruitment. It puts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



an  end  to help from overseas, which means  that  we

shall have to fall back on our own limited resources,

while  the  proposed union with the  Federation  will

presumably make matters worse, as across the Causeway

there is one doctor to every 9,000 of the population.

The fact is that we shall need to do an immense drive

to  find  sufficient doctors to man the new  district

hospitals to maintain even the present ratio  of  one

to 2,667 of a rapidly increasing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Service Scheme seems to us an

empty  catch  phrase, either for something  which  we

have  already expanded or are in agreement to expand,

or,  if the people have to contribute towards it, for

a   new   form  of  taxation  which  will  be  highly

unpopular. We hope therefore that the Government will

be  able to give us a more reassuring picture of  its

intentions than we have been able to gather from  its

statement of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not dwell long, Sir, on the subject of

public  transport, which has already been dealt  with

by  the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew),

and  I hope he will not be horrified to learn that  I

am  in  agreement  with what he  said.  At  least  we

have - [Interruption.] I must, however, correct him  on

one  point.  Last  year the City Council - Progressives

and  all - unanimously recommended the setting up of  a

public transport board to run the transport services,

in  other words, to nationalise transport, and it was

the professional administrators who turned this down.

We  therefore also want to know - and the Minister  for

Communications and Works was not very enlightening in

his  reply - what  are  to  be  the  functions  of  the

proposed  transport authority. Is it merely  to  take

over  those  duties  performed by the  City  Council,

which is the present transport authority? If so, then

it is a change only in form and not in substance, for

it  will mean that the Singapore Traction Company and

all   the   other  private  enterprises   now   given

monopolies  to  run  a  very essential  service  will

continue  to  enjoy their monopolies, at least  until

"the time is ripe", whenever that may be. A very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



surprising  policy  for  a  Socialist  Government  to

adopt, and all the more surprising when the policy of

nationalisation was an election pledge. The  question

is therefore a simple one. Is the Government going to

implement its election pledge or is it not? If it  is

not,  then the public of Singapore is going  to  have

transport run by private companies for another  seven

years, from roughly the end of this year until 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next matter on which I wish to touch is the

Banishment   Ordinance.  If  there  is   to   be   an

examination of the Emergency Regulations, it is quite

clear  that  a similar examination of the  Banishment

Ordinance  is in order, and we welcome  it.  In  this

connection  I would draw the attention of  the  Chief

Minister - or should it be the Chief Secretary? - to one

point.  At  the  moment, persons born  in  Singapore,

Malacca  or Penang cannot be banished, while  persons

born  in other parts of the Federation, although they

may  be  resident  in Singapore, and  indeed  on  the

electoral register, can be banished. This seems to me

illogical  at any time, but even more so  today  when

the  Government is contemplating early union with the

Federation.  I  seek  an  assurance  that,   as   the

Banishment Ordinance is to be reviewed, all cases  of

persons  due to be banished shall be stayed forthwith

and reviewed individually. It would clearly be unjust

to  banish a man now for reasons which may be revoked

in  a  month or two. I hope that the Government  will

give this assurance before the close of this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more matter and I have done. I wish to refer to

what  I  consider  another serious  omission  in  the

Government  statement, namely the action proposed  to

be  taken to put an end as far as possible to serious

flooding. I have no doubt that other hon. Members are

interested  in  this matter, but none  more  than  I

myself  as  Member for the constituency  of  Tanglin.

Hon.  Members  may  have  different  opinions  as  to

whether the floods are the more serious in the Bedok,

Geylang  Serai, Whampoa, or Bukit Timah area,  but  I

must  bring to the attention of Government  that  the

present extensive building programme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



development  in  the Bukit Timah  area  is  producing

conditions whereby after any very severe storm of  no

more  than one hour's duration, the Bukit Timah canal

is  liable to overflow its banks to produce hardship,

suffering and considerable inconvenience. That  is  a

very serious position. However, I am glad to say that

from  my own observations and from what I learn  from

the  villagers themselves, the new Ulu  Pandan  pilot

scheme, which strangely enough lies for the most part

within  the  Tanglin  constituency,  seems  to  be  a

success.  The pilot canal is taking water away  in  a

westerly  direction towards the Ulu Pandan River  and

has  put  an end to serious flooding in the immediate

area.  The way therefore seems to be clear to  tackle

the major scheme - admittedly a gigantic one - of taking

the waters of the Bukit Timah-Alexandra area away  to

the  sea  and  away from the city. I  hope  that  the

Government  will not fail to tackle this  problem  as

urgently and energetically as they have undertaken to

tackle other problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I ant a

businessman and I am not moved by eloquence. On  this

very floor I have heard many brilliant speeches. As a

businessman I believe in results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a member of the Progressive Party, nor

is there much love lost between me and Mr C. C. Tan,

but  I am sorry to hear the uncharitable remarks made

by   the   Chief  Minister  now  in  his  responsible

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday the Chief Minister dwelt on the

British    Government's    generosity    of    giving

independence to various countries. I rose on my  feet

and  tried to stop him on a point of order, but  you,

Sir,  allowed him to proceed. Well, if I say anything

now, if the British friends are displeased, the blame

should be on the Chief Minister for his ignorance and

ignorant remarks. No country in the world, or  rather

no  colonial  power  in  the world,  has  ever  given

freedom  on  a plate, unless with a struggle.  I  was

rather  astonished at the freedom granted  to  India.

There was no freedom granted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



at  all  by anyone. It was fought for and  got  from

Britain.  Sir, it was an insult to the  thousands  of

patriots  who suffered in jail, lost their  lives  in

jail,   and  who  struggled  for  50  to  70   years.

[Interruption]. Yes, I was born there and I had  seen

many  lathi charges by the British - [Interruption].  I

hope,  Sir,  I  will  not be interrupted.  If  it  is

allowed, Sir, it will be our privilege to do so also.

Well, Sir, the British have left not only India,  but

Palestine,  the  Sudan,  and  for  that  matter  many

countries,  but  left  those countries  divided  with

bitter  feelings. Now, Sir, Asia has attained freedom

except  this part or this colony. His Excellency  the

Governor  naturally  did not touch  on  independence.

When  our Chief Minister stated that we were to  have

self-government  within four years  and  independence

afterwards, I was rather very much amused.  Why  wait

for  four  years when the surrounding  countries  are

quite free? We are working this constitution. Why not

demand  now;  within  six months  self-government  at

least;   and   why  wait  for  the  Federation?   The

Federation has got its own problems, the Sultans  and

their subjects. There are the British territories  of

Penang  and  Malacca. On the other hand,  this  is  a

British   colony.   We   can   demand   freedom    or

independence, and if we are free we can also free our

neighbour. I think my British friends will forgive me

and  blame  the Chief Minister for bringing  up  this

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, His Excellency the Governor's assurance

that  no expatriate will be employed unless with  the

knowledge  of  the  Ministries  or  members  of   his

Ministries - I do not think I am satisfied  with  this.

Sir,  it  has  been said that it was the  Progressive

Party  who was responsible for this motion,  and  the

Progressives took the blame for being rather slow  in

its implementation. Sir, this was my motion moved  on

the  18th  of  November, 1952, that there  should  be

Malayanisation. A committee was appointed, and  their

report appeared sometime in 1954. Well, there will be

some  questions  by me, that is, when  I  moved  this

motion in 1952, between that period and the period of

the report, how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



much  hurry was made to get expatriates appointed.  I

will  make  this  subject my  next  question  in  the

Assembly.  Not only that, Sir, but after  the  report

was  published,  how many more were appointed  before

this  Assembly  came  into being.  It  will  be  very

interesting to know if there are very few posts  left

for  further  appointments for  the  local-born,  and

whether  we  will have to pay a very high  price  for

abolition terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad it is realised that Singapore's

economy  depends  on  its entrepot  trade.  Also  His

Excellency  the Governor and the Chief Minister  have

made  remarks  that various services  should  expand.

Well,  that was nothing new. During these last  seven

years  the  Legislative Council, then  existent,  had

passed  so many welfare measures - medical, education,

social and others. Our income is limited. We have got

no  natural resources of our own, none whatsoever. We

only depend on the entrepot trade, but that trade  is

mostly  with  Indonesia, and Indonesia is  also  very

conscious  of  this trade passing through  Singapore;

and  naturally  every country will try  for  its  own

betterment.  Then,  Sir, where is the  income  coming

from?  We  have  got  only limited resources.  Higher

taxation? Well, you will drive away foreign  capital.

What is the other alternative? I might try to suggest

one or two for the benefit of the present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1952, the Government, in reply to my

questions  in  the  Legislative Council,  said,  "The

amount  of hard currency earned by Malaya as a  whole

was $377 millions, and for Singapore $50 millions." I

have  questions for this Assembly to which I hope  to

get  replies, possibly on the 24th of May. Now,  Sir,

this  hard  currency belongs to us. This is  our  own

earning. It should be retained for the benefit of the

people.  The gold dollars if we have with us  we  can

utilise in many ways. We can import goods which  will

bring down the cost of consumer goods. That means the

masses  will  have to pay less. Their spending  power

will  increase. But what is happening up to now?  Our

hard-earned currency is given to the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



Kingdom,  I  do not know on what terms. I am  waiting

for  the  answer, out whatever the answer may  be,  I

will  move  that  this  should be  retained  for  the

benefit of this country and should not be handed over

to anyone, unless on certain terms. We can utilise it

to  our  best  advantage. But  today,  Sir,  what  is

happening?  We are getting consumer goods  from  hard

currency  areas,  from Hongkong. Malaya  has  to  pay

black-market  rates for our own consumer  goods.  Our

masses pay higher rates. Why cannot it be utilised by

importing direct, and utilise these gold dollars  for

ourselves? That is one way of saving, which is  quite

a lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is income tax. I think this

Department must be tightened so that the evaders  may

be  brought  to book and we can get more  money  from

them.  If  you think of higher income tax, well,  you

have got to look at the Colony of Hongkong. They  are

paying  much  less than what we are  paying.  In  any

case,  I hope the Government will be very careful  to

find  the  money and use means which will  not  drive

away trade from Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one more remark. I think it was the Chief

Minister  who said about the Progressive Party,  that

they  did not do this and they did not do that.  But,

Sir,   in  the  Legislative  Council  there  was   no

unofficial  elected majority at all.  The  Government

used  its official votes or the nominated votes. What

is  happening today in this Legislative Assembly? You

have  got  four Nominated Members and three  Official

Ministers, and today the Government is doing the same

thing. This is an evil, and this evil must be removed

immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was rather amused when the Chief Minister

yesterday, Sir, spoke about the coolie. I  think  the

better  term used today is "labourer", not  "coolie".

The  labourers are insulted: but it was rather an old

term  to  use.  Then  he was rather  unhappy  that  a

labourer earned only $31. Well, I will take  this  up

when  he  gets through the next motion, his  princely

salary:  How  much is he going to cut from  that  and

hand it over to those labourers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last thing I want to say is that it is very

undemocratic  to  have a ban on public  meetings.  It

should be removed immediately. That is common law. If

anyone  were to say anything which is seditious,  the

law  could take its own course. But I say this,  that

it  is  very  undemocratic. The ban must  be  removed

forthwith.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened

with  much  delight to the speech of the  Member  for

Tanglin  (Mr John Ede). He seems to be also a convert

to Socialism. His speech was not only delightful, but

also amusing, and amusing indeed when he accused,  in

anticipation, that the Government might  not  go  far

enough   to  cover  even  the  programme  which   the

Progressives had in anticipation also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, Sir, that there is at present free medical

treatment. That is so on paper; that is so to a  very

small body of the poor people. A single visit by  him

to  the General Hospital Outpatient Department or  to

the   Kandang  Kerbau  Maternity  Hospital  will   be

sufficient  to convince him that the poor  have  very

little  chance of free treatment. The queue seems  to

be  an endless one. A poor person is lucky if he gets

attendance at one of these hospitals if he called  at

ten o'clock, and by four o'clock he has been attended

to.  It  is  the policy of this Government to  remedy

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been wondered, Sir, why the word "compulsory"

was  left out in His Excellency's speech when applied

to  education.  It is not yet time to make  education

compulsory  because the schools and the teachers  are

not yet ready.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why put it in the programme?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is a four-year programme, and not a two-year programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> I am very much obliged to the

Chief  Minister, Sir. Our programme  is  a  four-year programme,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



but  at the moment we realize that if we were to make

free education compulsory, that legislation will come

to  nothing and will cause hardship and embarrassment

to  us.  Now that part of the programme of  the  last

Government,  Sir, which falls within the provision  of

our   objects   and  our  four-year  programme   will

certainly  be carried out, and I give that  assurance

to the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, I had the privilege of hearing very

long  and  interesting speeches  by  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew). So  much  of  his

speech  that has not displeased me I must say I  have

enjoyed. In fact, I must say that I did enjoy a large

portion of his speech to such an extent that I  began

to  wonder and wondered why in this modern  world  of

ours, ghosts still exist. It seems that the ghost  of

the  Government has turned itself into  an  excellent

solicitor,  giving the Member for Tanjong Pagar  such

an  excellent brief that he was able to put in  words

what the Government has in mind and under its serious

consideration.  For that, Sir, we  must  express  our

gratitude to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take one example of his speech, that

is,  his  remarks relating to Malayanisation  of  the

Public Service. His remarks had pleased me except  to

this  extent:  because we, the Government,  feel  the

Government  must  honour its  obligations,  legal  or

otherwise;   when   an  overseas  employee   of   the

Government  has  been  found  to  be  redundant,  the

Government  must provide sufficient compensation  for

the earlier termination of his service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of the National Service Ordinance, the

Government has under its consideration this Ordinance

with  a  view  to introducing appropriate amendments,

but   while  we  are  expecting  self-government  and

independence  round  the  corner,  we  must   prepare

ourselves  for that self-government and independence,

and  before  it comes, it may be well that  we  train

ourselves sufficiently well enough to be able to look

after ourselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard also, Sir, the interesting speech of

the  Member  for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck),  who

said that he is a businessman and as a businessman he

cannot appreciate how the Government could lend money

without   interest.  Government,  Sir,   is   not   a

businessman and should not try to be one.  Government

can venture to help those who are in need without any

idea  of  making  profits, and that is  the  definite

policy  of  this  Government when it declares  itself

ready  to  lend money without interest to those  poor

people who want to buy a house for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Paya Lebar had allowed himself the

opportunity of enjoying one of the speeches at  least

of the Chief Minister under what they call the "apple

tree" - I should call it a "durian tree" - he would  have

heard that the Chief Minister declare under that tree

that  the  Labour Front does not intend to  kill  the

goose  that lays the golden eggs. In fact, the Labour

Front  wishes  to feed that goose with  new  capital,

with new industry and such other nourishment, so that

the  goose  may be able to lay more golden eggs,  not

only  for  that goose but for all those  who  are  in

need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong),

Sir,  also  appears  to  have gained  some  Socialist

ideas.  He  appears to be interested in Boys'  Clubs,

but he made this statement which is not correct, that

all  Boys' Clubs in Singapore are being supported and

run  by  private organisations. More Boys' Clubs  are

being  run by the Social Welfare Department, and  the

Boys'   Clubs   that  are  being   run   by   private

organisations have received financial and other  help

from  the Social Welfare Department. He wants  credit

to  be  given  where  credit is due.  From  the  last

Government we received a legacy of a reserve fund  of

about  a  hundred million dollars. I do not  like  to

give  credit,  Sir, to any government or  any  public

body for having a large reserve fund when the members

of  that  public have so much to ask  for  and  their

requirements have not been attended to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully associate myself with all the

observations  on the Governor's speech  made  by  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some points in the Governor's speech that could be commended; there is also much to be said against it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who has had close connection with employees

of  the  Armed  Services, I have  this  to  say:  the

locally   enlisted  employees  of  the  three   Armed

Services  in Singapore so far have not been bound  by

the labour and social legislation of this Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Naval Base Labour Union at one stage boycotted

the  election to the Legislative Council because  the

workers felt very strongly, and rightly too, that  as

long  as the Government of Singapore, no matter  what

its  constitution might be, was powerless to  enforce

legislation in the Armed Services, so long  would  it

be  futile  for  the  workers to participate  in  the

political life of this Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor's speech alludes to the likelihood of

agreement being reached with Her Majesty's Government

that  the  Labour  Bill  should  cover  all  civilian

employees  of  the three Armed Services recruited  in

Singapore.  This  is  a very far  cry  from  what  we

expected  and wanted. What we seek and what  we  have

every right to have of any self-respecting government

is  not  only the voluntary acceptance by  the  Armed

Services,  but  what  we want  is  unconditional  and

obligatory application by the Armed Services of  such

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are surprised that the new Government should

appear   so  uninterested  in  asserting  legislative

authority throughout the territory of Singapore.  The

locally   enlisted  employees  of  the  three   Armed

Services   in  Singapore  number  about  40,000   and

constitute  one-sixth of the total  labour  force  in

this  Colony. As far as the 40,000 locally  recruited

Services employees are concerned, the right  to  vote

and  to elect representatives to the Legislature will

remain  a  barren  right while  that  Legislature  is

powerless to better the workers'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



working  and  living conditions.  The  trappings  and

paraphernalia of a democratic form of government  may

be  present, but unless that government has the power

to improve the workers' working and living conditions

without having to consult the Imperial Government,  I

maintain  that  that government is a  mockery  and  a

sham.  It  is  to  be  hoped that the  Government  of

Singapore will insist on unconditional and obligatory

observances  of all social and labour legislation  by

the  Armed  Services and not just plead for voluntary

acceptance of such legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of trade unions, I am also

particularly concerned over the present labour unrest

in  the  Colony. I take this opportunity of  thanking

the  Minister  for Labour and Welfare  in  trying  to

settle  all these labour disputes. The first  dispute

that  the  Minister  has to deal with  has  been  the

dispute in the Singapore Harbour Board. It is  to  be

regretted,  however,  that the labour  situation  has

reached  a  deadlock.  There is angry  discontentment

among  the  workers of the Harbour Board;  so  it  is

among the other workers of the Colony. Poor wages and

obnoxious working conditions are obvious reasons  for

discontentment.  Mismanagement  and  mishandling   of

personnel may also be another cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers have been exploited for much too long. I

therefore suggest that the present Legislature should

legislate  in the interest of workers. Any  tentative

or  half-hearted approach to this issue will  be  not

only derogatory to the dignity of this Assembly,  but

would  also  constitute an insult to  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Government, we have been told in the  Governor's

speech,  is  anxious  not to  damage  the  fabric  of

security  and  it  is therefore  going  to  ask  this

Assembly   to   adopt  the  Governor's   Proclamation

extending  the period of emergency for another  three

months. What does the Governor mean by "the fabric of

security"? Security for whom? Security for a colonial

system! The Government is not interested in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



security of the people from detention without  trial.

Is  the Government interested in the security of  the

people's  democratic  freedoms of  speech,  assembly,

expression  and  organization? If the  Government  is

sincerely interested in the security of the  people's

democratic   rights,  why  does  it  seem   to   have

difficulty   in   making  up  its  mind   to   repeal

immediately  the Emergency Regulations? The  People's

Action  Party  is  only interested  in  securing  the

democratic rights of the people and these rights  are

seriously  attacked by the Emergency Regulations.  We

therefore  say  that  any  government  which   really

represents the people cannot tolerate, even  for  one

minute,  any law which attacks the democratic  rights

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor knows the decision of the people on the

Emergency  Regulations. The people wanted the  repeal

of the Emergency Regulations because they wanted back

their  lost freedoms of speech, expression,  assembly

and  organization;  because they wanted  to  end  the

untold  sufferings and unhappiness  caused  by  these

regulations; because they wanted freedom from  arrest

by  the  almighty police force armed  with  arbitrary

powers. It is this thing that the people had in  mind

about the regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people ask for fundamental democratic rights,

but  what  have  they got? They  have  only  got  the

freedom to fire crackers after seven o'clock  in  the

evening. The people ask for bread and they have  been

given stones instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears from the Governor's speech that the

present  Government intends to continue with national

service,  but  the  elected  representatives  of  the

people  have  still no control over foreign  affairs.

What  guarantee is there that our young men will  not

be  used  as  cannon fodder to fight  other  people's

battle  for  them?  Do the people  of  Singapore  and

Malaya  have  any  choice of their friends  or  their

foes?  How  is  it that although the people  of  this

country  are  supposed to be unfit for  independence,

they  are considered fit to die for the interests  of

other  peoples?  The People's Action  Party  believes

that only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



an  independent government has the right to  ask  the

people to take up arms to defend their own country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the people of Malaya want peace. They are

not  intent  on  or interested in  the  war  plan  of

foreigners and if there is a war in Asia,  our  young

men fight their fellow Asians to defend the interests

of  the  foreign powers in Asia. Are Asians to  fight

Asians, as President Eisenhower of the United  States

publicly intends?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan people now learn from the newspapers

that  Australian and New Zealand troops  are  now  to

come  to Malaya to defend us. Defend us against whom?

Against  ourselves!  The Malayan  people  were  never

consulted by anybody on this matter. Are the  elected

Members of this Government prepared not to place  the

fate  of  the  people in the hands of  all  kinds  of

foreigners?   Will  the  elected   Members   of   the

Government  respect the dignity  of  the  people  and

demand  that foreign troops should not be allowed  on

our  soil  and make our country a military  base  for

foreign powers? The elected Members of the Government

can be certain of one thing. If there is not a -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. During this

short  period  we  have  been getting  accustomed  to

election speeches, but nevertheless I must point  out

that   the  question  of  external  defence  has   no

reference  to  the  matter of the Emergency,  of  the

subject now discussed, and is not in any part of  the

speech  of His Excellency and that it is no  part  of

the functions, unfortunately, of the Government under

the present constitution. It is a matter entirely for

His  Excellency's reserved powers in respect of which

he has supreme authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am glad that the Chief Minister has

raised  this point of order. Mr Lim, any attempt  to

say  anything  now about the defence of this  country

by,   as   you  called  them,  "foreign  powers"   is

completely out of order because that function has not

been  stated  to be within the policy of the  present

Government.  It  is also still one  of  the  reserved

powers  of the Governor If you wish to try and remove

those reserved powers of the Governor, or discuss the

subject  further,  you can do  so  by  a  substantive

motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



or  otherwise  some other time; but this,  I  do  not

think, is the proper time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> Education. I know that the

Governor's  speech  contains no  clear  statement  of

education  policy.  What is the  Government's  policy

towards  vernacular  education?  Do  we  accept   the

principles  of  the United Nations Charter  that  the

right  of every community to develop its own language

and  culture must be respected, or we carry  on  with

the   present   policy   of  discriminating   against

vernacular education? The present education policy is

a  colonial education policy. Therefore education  in

the mother tongues of the people is not respected and

encouraged  by the Government. The present Government

must  replace its policy with a democratic  education

policy  which  will  respect and encourage  the  full

development  of  the mother tongues  of  the  peoples

which  are  Malay,  Chinese and Tamil.  The  People's

Action Party will not accept an education policy  the

aim   of   which  is  to  produce  black  and  yellow

Europeans.  The  Governor's  speech  mentions   equal

treatment   for  all  schools.  Does   this   include

financial provision for vernacular schools  equal  to

that  provided  for  English schools?  And  does  the

Government intend to remove the conditional grants-in-aid for Chinese schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, what about equal treatment for teachers of

vernacular  schools?  At  present  there  is  a   big

difference   between  English  school  teachers   and

vernacular  school  teachers in  their  salaries  and

conditions of service. This alone has proved  to  the

people that the Government does not want to encourage

vernacular  education  and  is  only  interested   in

encouraging   English  education.  If   the   present

Government   wishes  to  prove   its   sincerity   to

vernacular education in Singapore, it must give equal

treatment   to  teachers  of  English   schools   and

vernacular schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government have all along been in complete control

of  Malay education in Singapore; yet Malay education

is  very backward in Singapore. Malay education  here

stagnates  at the primary school level.  Why  has  it

never been developed, like English education,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



up  to  Senior Cambridge? Because the Government  has

never  been interested in encouraging the development

of  the  Malay language and culture. I hope that  the

present  Government  will change its  policy  towards

Malay  education  and  help  to  preserve  the  Malay

language  and  culture instead of killing  it.  After

what  it  has done to Malay education, the Government

now  wants  to control Chinese education  completely.

Why   does  Government  want  complete  control  over

Chinese  schools?  Is it in order to  reduce  Chinese

education in Singapore to the same poor condition  as

Malay   education?  Is  this  the  reason   why   the

Government is trying to convert the Chinese  language

in  Chinese schools into a second language? Under the

present  education policy there is every danger  that

the  Government  wants to introduce  English  in  the

Chinese  schools, not as a second language only,  but

as  the  main  language.  We hope  that  the  present

Government  will  try  and  remove  all  the  present

dangers   to  vernacular  education  by  adopting   a

democratic education policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade Unions. The Governor's speech promises that

all   possible   assistance   will   be   given    to

strengthening the trade union movement. The  People's

Action  Party would like to ask how the  trade  union

movement   can   grow  strong  under  the   Emergency

Regulations.  The class of people who  have  suffered

the  most  under  the  Emergency Regulations  is  the

working  class.  The Emergency Regulations  hold  the

trade union movement by the throat. The working class

can  hardly  breathe. Under the Emergency Regulations

the real rulers of the people are the Special Branch.

The  workers  and trade unionists are threatened  and

intimidated by police spies and informers, who try to

wreck  working-class organizations from  within.  The

final  weapon  of the desperate worker  living  under

intolerable conditions is the strike weapon, but even

this  weapon  loses  its effect under  the  Emergency

Regulations.   The  fourteen  days'   strike   notice

required   under  the  Emergency  Regulations   gives

employers  plenty  of time to hire "black  legs"  and

make  other  arrangements to break  the  strike.  The

employers enjoy all the advantages under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



the  Emergency  Regulations because  these  laws  are

directed against the interests of the working  class.

If  the  Government  really wants to  strengthen  the

trade union movement, let it first of all repeal  the

Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund Ordinance. We are told

that  the  Central Provident Fund Ordinance is  under

examination with a view to further amendment. I  hope

that  the  Government  is  aware  of  the  widespread

dissatisfaction among workers against this Ordinance.

The wages of the workers today are already too low to

meet  the basic human needs of the workers and  their

families.  The  bitter struggle  for  existence  will

become harder for the majority of workers if they are

forced  to contribute 5 per cent of their low  wages.

The  Government does not seem to be interested in the

present  insecurity of the workers. Strangely enough,

the  Government  pretends to  be  interested  in  the

future  security  of the workers, but  not  in  their

present  security. It is very difficult for a  worker

to  make sense of the way in which the minds  of  the

authorities  work. First, let us improve the  present

which  is hard enough for a worker. Then we can  take

care of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the Governor's speech gives the illusion

that  the present Government is somehow fundamentally

different from the previous Government of the Colony.

I  warn the elected Members of the Government not  to

fall  victim to this illusion. They form  part  of  a

colonial  government, and the  real  rulers  are  not

present in this Assembly. They are thousands of miles

away in the Colonial Office in London. If the elected

Members of the Government think that they can  reform

colonialism, they are sadly mistaken. They  might  be

fools,  but  let  them remember that the  people  can

never be fooled. The People's Action Party says  that

there  never has been and never can be any substitute

for  full  democratic and complete independence.  The

people never say, "Slow progress to self-government."

The people say, "Merdeka!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of explanation. Mr Speaker, Sir, yester-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



day  I apologised to the Hon. the Chief Minister  for

somewhat  misquoting him, but I feel it is  my  duty,

before  he rises to reply to the motion which he  has

moved, to quote accurately what he had said, or, if I

may  say so with all due respect, what he had  placed

in  a  written peroration in the issue of a newspaper

dated  31st  of October, 1954, under the  heading  "I

BELIEVE" and sub-heading "Frustration":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe the Rendel Constitution of next year is

out of date today. The retention of the portfolios of

finance,  administration, and internal  security  and

law  means  the  retention of the  pivotal  positions

controlling  the direction, pace and content  of  our

development.  It  is  fraught with  dangers  born  of

bitter  friction and frustration if  strong  men  are

elected.   It   is  colonialism  unchanged   in   its

character,  with local men to receive opprobrium  for

unpopular measures."



<br><br>That, Sir, was the 31st October, 1954.



<br><div align="center"><b>Suspension of Sitting</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion made and Question proposed,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sitting be suspended until 2.30 p.m." (The Chief Minister).

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed on Question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, if as the Chief Minister claimed yesterday he is

friendlily disposed towards the British, I  think  he

might  have spared us the harrowing scenes  he  drew,

depicting  us  as  a  race of slave-drivers.  Such  a

description  might have been well fitted  to  a  pre-election  speech,  but I think most inappropriate  at

the  present  time and liable to create  inter-racial

bad feeling. It was, of course, a magnificent vehicle

for oratory of a very high order, but beyond that,  I

cannot see that it has

any merit in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the word "taipan" scornfully. I do not know,

unless  he was anticipating multi-lingualism, why  he

used  this  particularly Chinese word. I  myself  was

described five years ago in China as a "taipan",  and

I  suppose  I must still be one. But I never  thought

for a moment of the word as being opprobrious.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One gathered from the Chief Minister's speech that

the  rich  of this country are those wicked "taipans"

and  colonial  masters. But is this  really  true?  I

suggest  to you that most of the British businessmen,

certainly in this town, are salaried officials. In no

sense do they control the wealth of this country  and

there  are  certainly no millionaires  amongst  them.

There  are millionaires in Singapore; quite a  number

of  them;  I believe they even have a club, but  they

are all Asian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so sanguine, either, of the views of the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew)  that

capital  will  continue  to  flow  freely  into  this

country  even  on a one hundred per  cent  per  annum

motive.   Capital  is  very  susceptible  indeed   to

insecurity and takes wings very quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking as usual only for myself,

I  cannot understand why the wicked "taipans"  should

be regarded as the arch criminals worshipping only at

the  shrine of mammon. Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

Chief  Minister's own ancestors came to this country

to  seek  their fortune, as I did, unless  of  course

they were missionaries, and I would say the same  was

true  of  the  ancestors of the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar,  whose  vitriolic  denunciation  of  the  vile

British made me feel even more -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of explanation, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. I would just wish to ask the Nominated

Member, Mr Sutherland, whether at any stage  in  the

proceedings  yesterday I had  used  the  words  "vile

British"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I apologise, Mr Speaker, if I

anticipated or rather suggested "vile", but if he did

not  use the word, he certainly implied it. At  least

that  is my interpretation of it. Anyway, the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar's denunciations of the British,  I

say,   made  me  feel  even  worse  than  the   Chief

Minister's  speech did. Fortunately  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  continued or  rather  attenuated  his

sermon and threats to the Labour Benches for so  long

that the feeling began to wear off.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, if we admit the frightful misdemeanours of

past generations of professional administrators - I  am

sorry  that that has also become a term of opprobrium

but obviously it has - they governed this territory  to

the  best  of their ability, and whether or  not  the

coolie   played   the  major  part  in   laying   the

foundations  of  its  prosperity, nevertheless  every

ancestor  of every Chinese in this House, I  suggest,

was  glad, like any other prospector for gold - to  use

the Chief Minister's analogy - to come to this country,

forsake his motherland and seek protection under  the

British flag. What is more - the immigrant retained the

full  privileges of his religion and  creed.  He  was

even  allowed  to take as many wives as  he  pleased,

which his colonial masters could not do without being

flung into prison - though why anyone should want  more

than one wife I cannot understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar doubts the bona fides

of the British Government to grant early independence

to these territories. I think he is wrong. Why cannot

he  be  a  little  patient? Men of  his  intellectual

attainments  do not grow on every tembusu  tree,  and

when  he  states that this country is ready  now  for

self-government, in my opinion, just my own  opinion,

I think he is allowing his heart to rule his head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one word on the Emergency Regulations. The

Emergency Regulations, as I see them, must be to  all

free men repugnant. But they are necessary; they  are

necessary  for one reason only: that we are  fighting

an  enemy,  an enemy who uses as weapons  murder  and

extortion, and for that reason only they must  remain

in force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  we  have  had  the  opportunity   of

listening  to  many eloquent speeches both  yesterday

and  today, some of which are the repetitions of  one

another,   and   others,  I  regret   to   say,   are

electioneering speeches. I do not want to make a long

speech  to  tax the patience of hon. Members,  and  I

will  confine  myself to matters  falling  within  my

sphere of responsibility.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) stated

that  there is no mention of higher education in  His

Excellency the Governor's speech and he felt that  no

amount  of primary education would serve the purposes

of  training  our people fit to take up positions  in

the  Public Services the Malayanisation of which  has

been  the  subject of attack. I wish to ask the  hon.

Member a few questions. Why is it that this city, the

tenth  busiest  port in the world,  is  suffering  an

acute  shortage of secondary schools? Why is it  that

we  now  face  a  flood of complaints  that  teen-age

children,  after  their primary  stage,  cannot  find

admission  to secondary schools? I need not  go  into

details, but hon. Members will agree with me that the

cause  of  these  complaints  is  the  fault  of  the

previous governments. I do not propose to gloss  over

the  fault  of  somebody else nor am I here  to  hide

behind  that cloak and do nothing about it. I  assure

hon. Members that it is the policy of this Government

to  do  all  it  can to speed up the construction  of

secondary  schools, provide more  places  in  schools

than has been possible hitherto, and to this end I am

sure  I have my colleagues' support to put right what

has  been  wrong and to execute the policy  that  has

been clearly stated in our programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to clarify one further point to which

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar and other Members  have

referred, and that is equal treatment for all schools

and   teachers.  The  word  "all"  includes  English,

Chinese,  Malay and Indian schools and  teachers.  So

our hon. Friend will have no more qualms about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of the Singapore Polytechnic,

I  want to make it clear that this project has, since

my  assumption of office, been my first concern,  and

the  present Government will see to it that what  has

been  put  down  on  paper will  be  translated  into

action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By expanding education and by the provision of more

schools  and the Polytechnic, I have full  confidence

that the youth of Singapore will benefit by them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to the Member for Tanglin (Mr John

Ede)  and  the Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim  Ching

Siong) for raising several points this morning, and I

can  assure them that all those points have, since  I

took  over  the  Ministry, been my concern;  all  the

points have been under examination and the Council of

Ministers  will  give me full support  in  deliberate

consideration and careful thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I want to assure this House and the people

of  Singapore that it is Government's aim to mete out

equal  privileges and rights to all schools, be  they

English,  Chinese, Malay or Indian schools. There  is

no   question  of  Government  trying  to  stop   the

development  of  any  vernacular languages,  and  the

difference  between  English and  vernacular  schools

should  be  looked into and will be the  subject  for

consideration by me as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I came to

this  sitting with the firm intention of  keeping  my

mouth  shut,  but the debate has proved  to  be  very

curious indeed, so much so that I feel I must  add  a

few  comments  on the antics of some of  the  Members

sitting on the opposite Benches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first sight, it would seem that some of them have

not yet got over the election fever which had them in

its grip since the last few months and therefore they

were  continuing  their  election  speeches  in  this

House. However, coupled to this sickness is the  fact

that  some of them are now vying with one another  to

bring  out  points  which are  already  part  of  the

Government  programme,  and  it  seems  to  be   very

suspicious  that  those who never  thought  of  these

things  before, and who would probably run away  from

such  ideas, had they been mentioned, are now  coming

up, advocating them. It is very evident to me, and  I

think  to  the general public whom they are  probably

trying  to impress through the Press, that  they  are

hoping thereby to get a bit of cheap publicity and  a

little credit for what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



they  fully well know the Government is going to  do,

whether they are with the Government or against.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather curious that the Member for Serangoon

(Mr  Lim  Choon Mong) yesterday told  us  that  this

Government  has  inherited a great deal  of  benefits

from  the  last government, and today the Member  for

Tanglin  (Mr  John Ede) tried to absolve  his  Party

from the deeds, misdeeds and, what is more important,

the  lack of deeds of the past government by  telling

us  that,  "After all, we Progressives  were  in  the

minority  anyhow.  What could we  do?"  That  is  the

Progressives all over. They want the credit, but they

dare not take the blame. However, I suppose they  are

out  to get a bit of credit, but however clever  they

may be, they cannot beat the Member for Tanjong Pagar

(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) who is a past master at this game;

it  seems, where if he fails to steal the credit,  he

will  try  to  steal  the  thunder  by  telling   the

Government to go one step further, and this game  has

proved  so  contagious  indeed  that  you  find  hon.

Members  who would not have dared to have such  ideas

now  come  out  talking with great  gusto,  "Why  not

independence tomorrow?"



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Today, I said.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this sort of

play-acting leaves one rather speechless,  though  it

has  made me speak. However, the consolation  remains

that we may turn out good actors and they would be an

added  asset to the wealth of this country, for which

I am sure the Labour Government would be grateful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down to brass tacks, Sir, the Member for

Sembawang (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) lamented the fact

this   morning  that  the  Government  has  made   no

provision  to  exercise control  over  the  terms  of

service  of  the  civilian  employees  of  the  three

Services.  He went even so far as to say  that  these

civilian  employees  should  not  take  part  in  the

political   life   of  this  Colony,   but   he   has

contradicted  himself,  I  think,  by  standing   for

election.  He  should  not have stood  for  election.

However, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



want  to  draw  his attention to the  speech  of  His

Excellency  the Governor in which it is  mentioned:

"The Government intends to introduce a Labour Bill to

replace the present out-moded Labour Ordinance. There

is  every likelihood of agreement being reached  with

Her  Majesty's Government that this Bill should cover

the   civilian   employees  of  the  three   Services

recruited in Singapore." I hope that is clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my  Party  knows  what the Government's  future

policy  is  to  be for the development of  the  rural

areas,  but in my opinion it does, not go far enough.

In  the  recent election the rural voters  played  an

important part and the fact that they did so  clearly

shows  that they want development in the rural  areas

to keep in step with the development in the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note with satisfaction that the Government has

promised to establish district hospitals and  clinics

in  the rural areas, which are so urgently needed.  A

problem for farmers in the rural areas is the absence

of  veterinary centres in these areas to  which  they

can  bring their poultry for inoculation. At  present

the   representative  of  the  Veterinary  Department

visits  the  farms  occasionally  to  inoculate   the

poultry.  But this, I submit, is not enough  and  can

never compensate for the absence of such centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rural areas are very poorly supplied with water

and  electricity and in a period of drought as  that

at  present prevailing the absence of water in  their

wells causes the farmers a lot of hardship. I do hope

that  the  Government will set up  the  provision  of

water and, electricity in these areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of fishermen living in these areas

and up to date nothing has been done to introduce co-operative marketing schemes for them. I hope that the

present  Government will give this matter the highest

priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas communications are very poor and

in  my  division alone, which covers more than twelve

square miles with a well distributed population,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



there  is only one public telephone at Ponggol Point.

I hope that the Minister for Communications and Works

will look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than fifty per cent of the dwellings of farmers

in  my  division are not numbered, and these  farmers

told  me  that they were very unhappy about it.  They

want their houses numbered and are quite prepared  to

pay  the required assessment on their homes.  I  hope

the  Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing

will look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party supports the Government's plans for the

development of the rural areas and will do  its  best

to  ensure that everything possible is done to  carry

out these plans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to congratulate

very heartily the Liberal Government of Singapore for

the  statement of policy laid before this Chamber for

our consideration, [An hon. Member: Liberal?] because

I  feel that the wording of the policy statement  has

been  so very carefully drafted that Socialists  like

myself  will not be able to attack it very seriously.

Nevertheless,  I would like to bring  forward  a  few

points  for the improvement of the policy  which  the

Liberal Government, if it cares to, can accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and foremost point, Sir, is the union of

Singapore  with  the Federation  of  Malaya  and  the

ultimate  self-government of the territory.  So  much

has  been  said, but all the speakers, I think,  have

forgotten to mention one important factor,  and  that

is  the  creation  of  a common citizenship  for  the

people  of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.  I

do not know whether they believe that a nation can be

created  without a common citizenship or  whether  in

the  near  future they will consider this aspect  and

bring it to the notice of this Assembly. In the  last

Council I very vehemently suggested the creation of a

Singapore  citizenship. I did not get any support  at

all  because  I  was  told that there  were  so  many

difficulties which confronted the government at  that

time. The position in Singapore today is that we have

some people as aliens, some as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



local-born British subjects, and some as citizens  of

the  United Kingdom and Colonies. No mention has been

made  by  the Government as to whether they would  or

would  not  create a common citizenship in  the  near

future.   However,  I  take  it  that   the   Liberal

Government would endeavour -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. We do not

like  to be called by barbarous names. We like to  be

called by our correct name.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is hardly a point of order, Mr

Chief Minister. Carry on, Mr Nair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> As I was saying, I take it they would try

to  implement  item 9 of the Labour Front  programme,

namely,  the creation of a Singapore citizenship,  at

the earliest possible date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the aliens have been denied the privilege of

voting.  Many  of the citizens of the United  Kingdom

and  Colonies  have  been  denied  the  privilege  of

enjoying  the  citizenship right. Not  long  ago  the

Government  asked  all the Commonwealth  citizens  to

register themselves as citizens of the United Kingdom

and  Colonies, and when I raised the question of what

privileges  they were entitled to, I  was  told  that

they  could only be regarded as second-rate  citizens

of Singapore. All the jobs advertised stipulated that

the  applicant should either be born in Singapore  or

should have a residential qualification of ten years.

No  mention whatsoever was made as regards the  right

of a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies for a

job  in the government service. I would suggest  that

the  same  privilege which is offered to a local-born

subject  should  also be given to a  citizen  of  the

United  Kingdom and Colonies, and I feel  that  there

should be no discrimination in regard to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government policy clearly recognizes that

there is unemployment on a wide scale, but I am  very

disappointed  to  see that no suggestions  have  been

made  regarding  measures  that  will  be  taken   to

eliminate  unemployment. My friend and colleague  the

Hon. the Minister for Labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



and Welfare on various occasions insisted in the past

Council that Government should appoint a committee to

investigate  the extent of unemployment in  Singapore

and   to   find   ways  and  means   of   eliminating

unemployment.  I  hope that the  Minister  would  now

appoint  a  committee  as soon  as  possible  as  the

position of unemployment in Singapore has come  to  a

very grave crisis. However, the Government might  try

to say that there is no unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, Sir, I understand that all

employers  are  obliged to register  their  vacancies

with  the  Labour Exchange. I think  if  we  were  to

prepare  some sort of a statutory provision  in  that

manner, we would be able to assess the true nature of

unemployment in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heartily congratulate the Hon. the Chief

Minister  for  having  the vision  in  appointing  an

Economic  Commission. I believe that  this  signifies

that  the  Government  intends to  have  a  Socialist

economy  for Singapore, but I would suggest that  the

members  of this Commission should be very  carefully

selected because I believe that you can be sure of an

independent  report if we are to have members  of  an

independent character. I would suggest, Sir, for  the

Chief Minister's consideration, that a member of  the

ECAFE  be  taken  as a member of this Commission  and

that  some hearings of this Commission should be made

in  public so that each and every individual  who  is

interested  in  the economy of Singapore  can  appear

before  the Commission and state his views.  I  would

also  urge,  Sir,  that this Commission  should  have

close liaison with other specialised agencies of  the

United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has now proposed to have a Trade

Advisory  Council to advise the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry  on  matters pertaining  to  trade  and

commerce,  but I am very disappointed,  Sir,  to  see

that  no  advisory council to go into the problem  of

the agriculture of this country has been suggested by

the  Chief Minister. Not long ago my hon. Friend  the

Member  for Ponggol-Tampenis gave a short description

of the disabilities of the rural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



people  in  regard to farming and agriculture.  Where

the  economy of the country is shaped on a  Socialist

basis,  I  have  never  heard  that  the  rural   and

agricultural economy has been left out. I  feel  that

the rural and city economies are closely related.  An

agricultural   council  would  act  as   a   research

institute  and, with the co-operation of the  farmers

and  agriculturists, would be able to frame a  policy

which could be implemented both by the Government and

the agriculturists themselves. In that way we will be

able  to raise the standard of the rural economy.  We

need  an increase in food production in this country.

More  than  50  per  cent of the  food  products  are

imported  now. It is so because there is  not  enough

local   food  production.  I  would  urge  the  Chief

Minister that this should be one of the main tasks of

his  Ministry in conjunction with the Trade  Advisory

Council. I want to see that a strong hand be given to

the Agricultural and Veterinary Departments. I do not

like  to  see three or four people working  with  the

Agricultural or Veterinary Department and then trying

to do a patchwork of the whole thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government policy on the standard of living

of  the  working class has shocked me a  great  deal.

There  had  been in the past a cry for  minimum  wage

legislation.  I  realise  that  before  we  can  have

minimum  wage  legislation we must have the  national

income  of  the  country assessed, but  I  think  the

Government  could  have mentioned  something  in  the

policy  statement  in  regard  to  its  minimum  wage

policy. Today in the city most of the workers of  the

transport companies are on strike. Why have they gone

on  strike?  They have gone on strike  because  their

wages and conditions of service are not satisfactory;

because  they believe that there should be some  sort

of  a  wage level by which they will be able to carry

on  their lives. If the Government were reluctant  to

have  this  minimum wage legislation straightaway,  I

would  suggest that a committee of inquiry should  be

instituted in all industries where there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



wage  disputes, so that the Government  could  assess

the  wages and conditions of service offered  to  the

workers  and,  in  co-operation  with  the  employers

concerned, settle the disputes amicably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing. We have heard the Government Benchers state

very  vehemently that some of the Opposition speakers

are  speaking  as if they were on election  platforms

and  that  there is not very much in those  speeches,

but  may  I  remind  the Government  Bench  that  the

electors  will take them to task on housing  matters?

The  rent charged by the Singapore Improvement  Trust

is  indeed  very high, and every one of  the  elected

Members  of  the  Labour  Front  has  promised   that

something  will be done to reduce the rent.  Probably

the  Government might think that after setting up the

Housing  Authority they will go into  this  question,

but  if  we  are  going to postpone everything  after

advice  is  received from other sources, I  think  it

will  be  too late. You have to do something  in  the

interim  to  find out how far the existing grievances

are   from  all  quarters.  May  I  suggest  to   the

Government   that  another  committee   of   inquiry,

departmentally, be set up so as to find out how  hard

the  tenants have been affected by the rent increase?

I was a member of the Singapore Improvement Trust for

four  months, and from my experience I can tell  this

House that many of the tenants are unable to pay  the

rent,  with the result that they receive quit notices

and they have to find accommodation elsewhere. It may

be  that  it might take four or five months more  for

the  Housing Authority to be set up and various other

relevant  matters  discussed  and  decided,  but  the

hardship of these tenants can no longer be tolerated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little mention of the rural housing in

this  policy  statement and also in the Labour  Front

programme. Probably the Labour Front elected  Members

have  not been elected from the rural areas. I  think

all of them are invariably from the city. The housing

situation in the rural areas is indeed pathetic. They

are  living invariably in houses where there  are  no

bathrooms or lavatories; and not only that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



with very little accommodation for the entire family.

And  I feel that one of the urgent problems that have

to  be attended to by the Government would be matters

relating to rural housing. The other day, when I  was

travelling along Alexandra Road, I happened to see  a

notice  board - "Singapore Improvement Trust  14-Storey

Houses".  I  do not think anybody in Singapore  today

would  like to live in a 14th storey, particularly  a

family. I would like the Minister for Housing to take

note  that most of the people in Singapore  today  do

not  like to live in the 14th storey. They would like

to  live either in the first or the second, not  even

the third.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What about the Seventh?



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Scrap those housing policies and

have more houses in the rural areas. Hitherto we have

been  complaining that there is no land in the  city,

but  now with the assurance of the Chief Minister  to

the  effect  that there will be State acquisition  of

land  we will not be lacking in land. We will be able

to  build houses wherever we intend them to be and we

shall have plenty of them in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to mention a very important factor

in  regard  to the rent formula and how that  can  be

reduced. I have been championing this cause for  many

years,  but  there have been some legal complications

in regard to this, and I hope that this will be taken

up  by  the Government. The City Council of Singapore

today  is collecting 34 per cent assessment from  all

houses  within the city limits, but a local authority

of  that  nature has no moral obligation for  housing

the  people  in the city. Shame! I have travelled  in

many  places, in London and Ireland when I was  on  a

parliamentary course, and people told me that  modern

governments  do  realise that  the  State  and  local

governments share the responsibility for housing  the

people,  and  here  in  Singapore  we  have  a  local

government denying the fact that they have any  moral

obligation  at  all for housing the  people  in  this

city. The Municipal Ordinance at the moment does  not

provide money being spent on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



housing,   and   I  hope  the  Minister   for   Local

Government, Lands and Housing, when he introduces the

Bill on the formation of the City and Island Council,

will  ensure that adequate provision is made in  that

Ordinance  to enable the City Council to spend  money

on  subsidising  housing. The 34 per cent  assessment

charged to the Singapore Improvement Trust is  really

the  basic  difficulty in regard to  rent,  the  City

Council's  argument being that the Improvement  Trust

houses should be treated in the same way as any other

houses built by private citizens. I do not agree with

that  because both the City Council and the Singapore

Improvement Trust are public bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of education, again - I did not number my

disappointments - it is again a disappointment that  no

mention  has been made in regard to adult  education.

We not only want a democratic form of government, but

we do want a democratic form of society, and this can

only  be brought about by encouraging, helping  adult

education.  I do believe that the Labour  Front  will

not overlook this matter. Probably they had forgotten

to write it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In matters regarding legislation, Sir, foremost that

comes  to my mind is the Rent Control Ordinance which

I  referred to some time ago. I do not think  that  I

should  elaborate the various difficulties the people

are  suffering due to the vagueness of this Ordinance

but  I  do  hope that in due course Government  would

amend  this  legislation  in  the  interest  of   the

tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Ordinance is giving another headache

to  the people of Singapore, and quite recently  many

families  in  my constituency have been subjected  to

very  severe mental anxiety, in that they are  unable

to  bring  their wives or children or  their  mothers

here because of the discretion that is vested in  the

Controller  of Immigration and now in  the  Hon. the

Minister   for  Labour  and  Welfare.  Although   the

discretion  lies  with him and  although  people  can

confide in him so that he will use his discretion  to

the  satisfaction  of  the  people,  there  are  very

relevant clauses which require amendment, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



I do hope, again, that the Labour Front will stick to

the  promises they have made some weeks ago in regard

to the amendment of this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of local government, Sir, it has

been  announced  that a Bill will be  coming  up  for

consideration of this Chamber very soon, and I  would

like  to  mention, Sir, that the provision of elected

District  Council Committees should be  an  important

feature.  I  think, if I remember it  correctly,  His

Excellency the Governor did mention the provision  of

such  committees in his Address last year. If we have

such  committees,  I do believe that  democracy  will

start  from the bottom instead of from the top as  at

present, because people will enjoy a greater  measure

of  democracy starting from their own places,  and  I

think  that is a really good sign for the  future  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport. I think I better wait until the Minister comes in. I will go on to the other items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land. I have a quarrel with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Which government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I might call it "Liberal", but I do not

know whether Mr Speaker will rule me out of order. I

thought  of  giving the explanation later  on  in  my

speech why I come to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land is supposed to be a very necessary element

in  the life of man. I do not know how far this right

has  been accepted by the present Government. I  only

read in their policy statement that they are going to

acquire  land  for public purposes. Socialists,  like

myself, will not agree that land acquisition  is  the

only  means  to socialise the country.  In  my  view,

there should be an agrarian policy, a policy by which

the  land can be redistributed to the people who  are

really  in  need.  Acquisition  can  be  done  by   a

Progressive government, a Democratic government,  but

definitely not a P.A.P. government, but I think that if

the  Government believes in real, modern,  democratic

Socialism, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



policy  of  land  reform is the  significant  factor,

excluding  of course nationalisation. But  I  do  not

know  why  the  present Government has  hesitated  in

making out a firm policy on land reform in Singapore.

In Singapore we have numerous acres of land on 99-and

999-year  leases,  by which many people  have  become

rich. They re-allot their land to other people;  they

get their land rent and if they have built houses  on

their  own  land,  they  get "tea  money"  and  other

profits  from their houses. I do not believe  that  a

Socialist government will allow that to happen. I  do

suggest,  Sir, for your consideration that Government

should  revise  the  terms of these  99-and  999-year

leases  and  take  over all those excess  lands  from

people,  give  them land according to the  number  of

persons in the family and a little bit more in  order

that they can adjust themselves; take over the excess

and  redistribute  it  to the  landless  citizens  of

Singapore. A survey of all lands, now lying idle  but

suitable for farming, should be made for distribution

to  the  peasants. There is difficulty being suffered

by   the   farmers  and  agricultural   citizens   in

Singapore,  in  that  they  cannot  obtain  land  for

cultivation.   I   feel   myself,   after   a   close

examination, that there are numerous pieces  of  land

in  Singapore which are lying idle and which  can  be

made really productive. I do suggest that a survey of

all  swamp  areas  be  taken  and  wherever  possible

reclaim  them  for  various  purposes.  If  it  is  a

building  site,  build  houses;  and  if  it  is   an

agricultural  site,  give  it  to  the  farmers   for

farming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy on ex-convicts also requires the

attention of the Government. At the moment  they  are

disregarded not only by the Government - in  fact,  the

Government  should have set an example in  this,  but

they  are not doing it - but also by many employers  in

Singapore.  They are being looked after  by  a  small

group  of public-spirited body of people, the  After-Care Association, who are trying to rehabilitate them

for a short time. They require assistance very badly.

The  State also assists in the rehabilitation of  ex-convicts. Another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



point  which  comes to my mind when  I  talk  of  ex-convicts is the fact that they are not recognized  as

men  in  society by Government. There is  a  General

Order  of  the  Singapore  Government  which  is  not

redundant  yet, saying that Government employees  who

have  been convicted will not be re-employed, and  if

they  are people with long experience, they will  get

no  gratuity.  I hope and believe, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  will  use  his

scissors  to  cut this first red tape in the  General

Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.

May  I inquire from the Member for Seletar (Mr Nair)

how   many  ex-convicts  there  are  in  the  Seletar

Division?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not only

representing the Seletar Division. I have,  I  think,

the  privilege  of raising any matters in  connection

with the people of Singapore in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One matter which comes to my mind is the cottage

industries  in the rural areas which will  raise  the

economy  of  the rural people. So far, the Government

of  Singapore  have not shown great interest  in  the

rural  industries,  and  I  believe  that  with   the

assistance of the Colombo Plan we will be able to get

help to start cottage industries in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of transport comes next, and I do

not  think  I can wait for the Hon. the Minister  for

Communications  and  Works. Some  time  ago,  Sir,  I

addressed  the  Front Bench opposite  to  me  as  the

"Liberal    Government".   A   Socialist   Government

preaching  Socialism would bear  in  mind  that  they

could  show  the  gravity and  seriousness  of  their

policy   to  the  people  at  the  opportune  moment.

Yesterday  the  Hon. the Minister for  Communications

and  Works said that the Government intends  to  take

over  public  transport, in other words,  nationalise

it,   when  the  time  comes,  and  if  there  is   a

possibility. I would tell this House that the test of

sincerity  of  the  Socialists  is  very  near.   The

Singapore  Traction  Company's  agreement  with   the

Government expires



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



some  time  in  June, and if the  Government  is  not

making a firm stand on it, I would assure this  House

that  I  will introduce a motion to test how far  the

Government is Socialist. This is the only opportunity

that  the  Government  has to  show  the  people  the

reality  of Socialism in its surest and truest  form.

There is no getting away with it. Sir, some time ago,

I   called   the  present  Government  the   "Liberal

Government". The Labour Front, the day when it wedded

the  Alliance, became Liberal. I do not know  whether

that marital relation has probably caused a change in

the Front's Socialist policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another test, Sir, for the Government, is equal pay

for  equal  work.  It has been mentioned  in  various

quarters  that real Socialists believe in  equal  pay

for  equal  work.  My hon. Friend  the  Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare will bear me out, while  we  were

sitting  together  on this Bench  as  Socialists,  we

demanded  equal  pay  for  equal  work.  This  is  an

opportunity  to show to the people of Singapore  that

the Labour Front believe in what they say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, as a Member of this Assembly returned

from   a   rural   constituency,  I  am   very   much

disappointed  to  see that although  there  has  been

mention of some development in the rural areas, it is

not  altogether  quite  satisfactory.  Every  time  I

mentioned in the last Council the inadequacy of rural

development,  I  was asked to refer  to  the  various

government expenditures in regard to the rural areas,

such  as  "road, one mile, $40,000" and some  drains,

half  a mile or ten feet, so many dollars. Government

has  been  neglecting the rural areas, a neglect  not

intentional  at all, but a neglect which was  limited

by  financial means. But this time when  there  is  a

promise  of raising the standard of living  of  every

human  being in this colony, I think the rural people

should  not lag behind. We have been doing a  lot  of

patchwork here and there. We asked for water  in  the

rural  areas;  the Rural Board fixed up  a  standpipe

there.  Tomorrow  I write in to say that  in  Thomson

Road there is no post-box; and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



Postal  Department  will fix a  post-box  there.  Our

development  in  the  rural  areas  has  always  been

patchwork  and  the result has been  that  today  the

rural people have not reached the same economic level

as  that  of the people in the city. They are  mostly

under-employed.   Their   economy   is    far    from

satisfactory. They have not the amenities which  they

should enjoy as citizens, although they pay rates and

taxes regularly in just the same way as the people in

the  city. There is only one right and proper way  of

developing   the  rural  areas,  and  that   is   all

departments should co-ordinate their activities  under

a   planning  committee.  I  suggest  that  a   Rural

Development     Council    be    established     with

representatives from various Government  departments,

including  the City Council, which is the  water  and

electricity authority, so that rural development  can

go  slowly  but steadily towards a happier goal.  The

fact that the Labour Front policy was not accepted by

my  constituency and other rural people clearly shows

that  there was something lacking in it, and that  is

development  of  the rural areas, which  I  have  now

stated  for your consideration. There is  no  way  of

developing the rural areas other than through  better

co-ordination and planning. I do hope that Government

will pay attention to this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that

the  sins  and omissions of past administrations  are

now  visited upon us on this side of the House. I  am

sure  it  is  realised that we, on this side  of  the

House,  contested the election on this  programme  in

order to adjust the ills that we felt were there, and

it is indeed a very happy indication to us, Sir, that

many  of my hon. Friends over that side of the  House

made  reference to this blueprint of ours for  a  new

Singapore.  I did not find any of them attacking  any

particular item. What they did say was that this one-year programme of ours was not enough and was not  in

keeping with what we said we wanted to do. Therefore,

I  can  say,  Sir,  that this then  is  the  accepted

blueprint for a new Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the various points that have been

made in regard to my particular Ministry. Let us take

the  Labour Bill, Sir. It was pointed out that in  so

far  as  the Labour Bill is concerned we had to  seek

the  agreement of Her Majesty's Government, and there

was  therefore resentment; and it was also  mentioned

by  one hon. Member that, to his knowledge, there was

no  Ordinance that covered the civilian employees  of

the Armed Services. I would like to point out for the

information of this House that to-date there are  two

Ordinances - the Central Provident Fund Ordinance  and

the  Workmen's Compensation Ordinance - that cover  all

civilian  employees of the three Services.  The  fact

that   the  United  Kingdom  Government  has  to   be

consulted  is in the same way as most large employers

of  labour have to be consulted when we try to  bring

in  anything new. Both parties must be consulted, and

I can assure this House that that Labour Bill will be

laid on this Table - the Second Reading will be on  the

24th of May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one is the Trade Disputes Ordinance. Sir, I

have  taken  note  of this Ordinance  that  has  been

brought  up by the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew),  and I assure him that his  remarks  will

receive my urgent consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong)

brought  up the question of what steps the Government

proposes to take to encourage trade unionism. We have

stated, Sir, in our policy that we will do all we can

to  encourage  the movement, because we believe  that

the  trade  union movement has an important  part  to

play  in our programme for a new Singapore. But, Sir,

having been a trade unionist myself and still  am,  I

would like to say to a fellow trade unionist that the

strength  of any trade union organisation is  not  in

any  help  that the Government can give, but  in  the

solidarity  of the workers. They should work  towards

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always felt, Sir, and I have spoken on other

occasions in this hall, that the English language  is

indeed a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



difficult language to understand. We find that  while

the   Governor's  Address  covers  just  a   one-year

programme,  yes it is being compared with  the  four-year  programme and hurled back at us. They  said  we

are  not  doing  enough. We have  to  carry  out  our

programme  year  by year, and we  know  that  we  are

answerable to our electors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

touched on the question of boys' clubs. He said  that

there  is  nothing in this Message that  conveyed  an

indication of Government's interest in the activities

of  boys'  clubs. I would refer him, Sir, to  page  6

(third  paragraph, column 8, of the Official Report).

May I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Community Centre scheme will be developed and

more  facilities  provided  for  the  underprivileged

youths of Singapore."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.  What I referred to were youth organisations  at

large,  which include not only underprivileged youths

but more organisations than that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Member for Seletar (Mr M. P.

D.  Nair)  mentioned unemployment. I can assure  him

that  I will take early steps to form a committee  to

investigate  the  unemployment  problem  and   submit

recommendations for meeting it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar also mentioned the

Immigration  Ordinance.  I can  assure  him  that  in

regard to the administration of that Ordinance, there

will be a change in the, shall we say, administration

of  it and I will look into the matter personally now

and  give directives as to how far in discretion the

Controller can go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down to a general issue, Sir. My hon. Friend

of the People's Action Party said yesterday, "So long

as you behave yourselves we will be with you." What a

paternalistic statement! We say, "So long as  we  are

right,  we  ask  you  to vote against  us."  Sir,  we

contested the election not so very long ago,  only  a

month ago, and we got returned here. We have not  had

the time - we have stated in the Governor's Address.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Ministers only had a  few  days  -  to  go

through  the work that is ahead of us. Therefore  the

programme  that we have suggested is limited  by  the

extent  of the period that was available to us  after

study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong)

touched on the Central Provident Fund. I am happy  to

learn  that he is now in agreement that there  should

be  amendments  to  this Ordinance.  Reports  in  the

newspapers  lately  showed that the  People's  Action

Party  was  organising  unions  into  opposing   this

Central  Provident Fund, and when it was pointed  out

that  by opposing it, instead of trying to amend  it,

was  just playing into the hands of the employers,  I

think they soon realised the error of their ways.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to

the contributions to this debate from certain Members

on Benches across the Floor, I have been irresistibly

reminded of a scene in an almost deserted street on a

Sunday  morning, with street urchins playing  in  the

drain  suddenly finding one of themselves all dressed

up  and  scrubbed  going to Sunday school,  and  with

whoops  of  joy  they  sling mud-pies  at  him.  Sir,

yesterday  I invited, I welcomed honest criticism.  I

said,  "Hurl your rocks of honest criticism."  I  did

not  say,  "Sling your mud." I have no use  for  mud,

although  I understand that it makes good manure  for

political growth.. I am not a politician, Sir. I seek

the  welfare  of  this country along simple,  obvious

ways. We have been reminded by the other side of  the

responsibility of office. I would remind Members that

one  can abuse too much the irresponsibility of  lack

of power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew), who

has  so  aptly been termed by my friend and colleague

as the cock that rouses the sun, says that the P.A.P.

stands  for  freedom, and now that freedom  has  been

discovered   by  the  P.A.P.,  the   P.A.P. has   a

prescriptive  right to it, patented  and  hallmarked,

and  those of us, Sir, who seek to serve freedom must

now go to the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



Tanjong  Pagar  for his chop - that  symbol  with  such

unhappy  memories once worn by the  Black  Shirts  of

England.  Sir, this hon. Gentleman, who has appointed

himself  the rearguard of the Labour U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-Malay Union Alliance Coalition, speaks of dreams.  It

is  our duty today to act. This hon. Gentleman offers

us,  Sir,  his  co-operation if we behave  ourselves.

Having watched the conduct of the hon. Gentleman  and

his  colleagues, it seems to us plain  on  this  side

that the offer is but the offer of the kiss of Judas;

that it is nothing but a cheap political manoeuvre to

seek  in this House to obtain credit for what we  can

achieve on the Government side, and to obtain  credit

for  what we cannot achieve, so that he can have  the

best  of  two  worlds.  That  is  not  the  type   of

co-operation I sought, Sir, and it is with regret that

I  notice,  at  the termination of this debate,  that

there  is  very  little I can expect in  the  way  of

constructive   statesmanship   from   hon.    Members

opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman of that Party - I think he is from Bukit

Timah  (Mr Lim Ching Siong) - has even indulged in  an

extraordinary  exhibition when he twisted  our  words

whereby  we  seek equal treatment for all schools  as

meaning that we wish to destroy Chinese culture. Sir,

there  is  a proverb or saying - Honi soit  qui  mal  y

pense - it  is the evil mind that will always  find  an

evil explanation. I have no patience, Sir, with those

who  can  only  see  evil  in  the  efforts  of  this

Government to secure the well-being of the people  of

this  country, and if that is what the hon. Gentleman

from Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong) wishes to read

into   the  simple  statement  that  we  want   equal

treatment for all schools, then he is welcome to that

evil interpretation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have these quibbles. Why have we left out

the word "compulsory" from "compulsory education"? Is

it  the same thing as education for all? Sir, we need

no   compulsory  education  today.  Our   youth   are

thirsting  for  education. We need to give  them  the

opportunity to slake that thirst, and our duty is  to

provide,  and  we shall seek to fulfil that  duty  to

provide, the opportunities for education. If and when

the time comes that we find there is any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



section, any appreciable section, of our youth  that

does   not   seek   education  and   we   have   the

opportunities available for them, then will  be  the

time to speak of compulsion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about public meetings and the

right  to  public assembly and free speech. The  hon.

and  learned  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  should  know

better.   The  question  of  permission  for   public

meetings  does  not  come under the  dread  Emergency

Regulations, as he and his colleagues seem to  think.

It  comes under the Minor Offences Ordinance. Sir, in

the  past,  as a result of the Emergency attitude  of

mind  of the police, these public meetings have  been

forbidden in open places. There has been, as far as I

am aware, no impediment to their being held in halls,

but they have been forbidden - or rather permission has

been  very  grudgingly and very  rarely  granted  for

public meetings in open places. This Government, Sir,

has  relaxed  that  rule, for which  it  receives  no

credit, to the extent that now public meetings may be

held  in  open places until dusk; but why,  asks  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar, can we not woo democracy in

the  dead  of  night? It is because,  Sir,  democracy

requires respect for minority feelings, and there  is

no  doubt,  Sir, that the seven years under  the  so-called  state  of  Emergency through  which  we  have

lived,  has  convinced  many reasonable  people  that

there  is  a  threat to security, and they  fear  the

possibility  of disorders from any extension  of  the

right  of  public assembly. Government  is  satisfied

that there is no real basis for that fear, but at the

same  time we have to respect their feelings  and  we

are   ourselves  feeling  our  way  to   a   complete

relaxation of that rule by this first instalment. And

when  we have proved, as we have no doubt it will  be

proved,  that  there is no danger in public  assembly

until  dusk, we can then go on to the  extension  of

that  rule. It is the same, Sir, as the procedure  we

have  adopted  with  reference  to  multi-lingualism,

where  there is very honest fear on the  part  of  an

appreciable section of decent human beings  who  have

no  particular political affiliations, that  this  is

impracticable; and we are now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



seeking to prove to them in a lesser sphere than this

that  this  is  practicable  and  so  toward  winning

unanimous  support.  It  is  not  in  the  realm   of

democracy  to ride rough-shod over minority  feelings

and  to  steamroller its way through,  because  of  a

majority that it may have in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other aspects of the Emergency Regulations on

which   hon.   Members  opposite  have   so   enjoyed

themselves, I shall not answer because it will be  my

unhappy  duty, after this item of business,  to  deal

with  the  Emergency  Regulations,  and  I  think  it

appropriate at that juncture to speak to hon. Members

on that point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been criticised from political extremes

for  our attitude towards compensation of expatriates

who  may  be  found redundant. It has been  suggested

that we have too tender a regard for these gentlemen;

that  maybe we are being bullied; and that  maybe  we

have  been subverted. Sir, our conduct in this matter

will  be  guided by one single principle  that  I  am

certain this House must at all times accept, and that

is  the principle of justice to all human beings, and

certainly to our own employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of Malayanisation, I must confess

that I am glad to find such vehement concurrence with

our  attitude from Members opposite, and I have  some

sympathy  for  the  views of the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar   on   the  subject  of  the  Public   Services

Commission.  I  do  recognise the  general  trend  of

public  feeling towards the officers who are  members

of  that Commission. I cannot say that I am satisfied

that  that  attitude  is justified.  I  do  not  know

enough.    I   do   acknowledge   that   this    very

unsatisfactory state of Malayanisation of  the  civil

service  at  the  present  juncture  is  perhaps   an

indication that those officers are not adequate,  but

it  need  not necessarily be their fault  and  I  can

assure the House of this - that long before this  House

met, that matter was already under investigation, and

still  is,  and  I sincerely hope that  hon.  Members

opposite  will  take  the  opportunity  at  the  next

sitting  to  place questions of a precise  character,

seeking   clarification  on  that  aspect  on   which

Government  can  give  you  clear  information,   and

perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



put a motion on for the Adjournment. I can say for my

side  of the House, Sir, that we want to hide nothing

there.   Our   flag  is  nailed  to   the   mast   of

Malayanisation at a rapid pace, and  if  we  fail  in

that  I  shall not wait for the P.A.P. to ask  me  to

resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, we heard the Member for Serangoon

(Mr  Lim  Choon Mong), and today we had a  newspaper

asking  where were the Progressives. The rump of  the

Progressives is here, Sir, and it seems  to  consider

its  main function to be to act as apologists for the

days  of  arrogant glory that can be  no  more.  That

extraordinary  spectacle of the Member for  Serangoon

telling  us,  "Of course my Party does  not  disagree

with  multi-lingualism! Do  have  it!  Bring  in  the

Hottentot and Eskimo languages, and Sanskrit, and  do

not  leave  out a single dialect! Don't!" The  Member

for Tanjong Pagar pointed out that nobody is going to

be  beguiled  by that sort of nonsense. We  are  glad

indeed to have forewarning that in this House will be

continued  the tradition we have come to expect  from

that  Party. The hon. Member sitting next to him told

us,  "Of  course  it is impracticable and  impossible

today,  but we are not against it." It does  suggest,

Sir,  that perhaps multi-lingualism is necessary even

in  this  House because that kind of logic  I  cannot

understand, and maybe if there was an interpreter  it

would help better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing I am indebted to the Member for

Paya  Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck), and that is for  his

assurance of co-operation on the matter of free legal

aid.  That, Sir, I accept unreservedly. I know it  is

genuine  and  I know I will receive his very  sincere

assistance, and I gladly accept it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then heard from the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R.

Jumabhoy),  whose  first complaint  was  that  I  was

uncharitable  to  a  former  Member  of  this  House,

because I did not like, and I considered abusive, the

suggestion    that   only   dishonest    self-seeking

demagogues  would want self-government in  less  than

eight  years.  Now,  if  the Member  for  Telok  Ayer

considers  that  a  just and proper  remark,  I  will

accept the rebuke for being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



uncharitable,  but I trust I speak for  the  rest  of

this  Assembly when I said that those were  terms  of

abuse  which you, Sir, would never have permitted  in

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar (Mr M. P. D. Nair) made

certain  suggestions of a valuable character,  and  I

think he will be pleased to know that the question of

citizenship, though we have been but a little time in

office,   has   not  been  forgotten;  and   district

committees in the City and Island Council  have  also

not  been  forgotten. In fact, there may be room  for

pleasant surprise for him in the sitting to  come  on

the  City  and Island Council Bill. But I find  it  a

little  difficult, Sir, to understand one  aspect  of

his  address where he said that we should have  equal

treatment  for domiciled Malayans as for persons  who

are British and colonial subjects. That does seem  to

suggest - I may be wrong in my interpretation, and if I

am,  I am sure you will clarify it later - but it  does

seem  to  suggest  that what the Member  for  Seletar

wants   is  complete  abolition  of  any  distinction

between the domiciled races and expatriates. That the

Government cannot accept and will not accept.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Certainly, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> What I said was that in Singapore

today  we have groups of citizens called the  aliens,

the  naturalised British subjects, local-born British

subjects, and the citizens of the United Kingdom  and

the  Colonies.  There are many Commonwealth  citizens

who  have  registered themselves as citizens  of  the

United  Kingdom and the Colonies, but  they  are  not

given  the same privilege as the local-born  subjects

in  regard  to  employment in the public  service.  I

believe  that the citizens of the United Kingdom  and

the Colonies should be treated in the same way as the

local-born subjects.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am afraid, Sir, the

clarification still leaves me as deeply confused, and

perhaps  we can clear this up later, because  if  the

citizen of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



the United Kingdom and the Colonies is to have the

same privileges as the local man, then there is no

distinction between an expatriate and a domiciled

person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say this in conclusion. Our

Four-year Programme has been repeatedly referred to.

Hon. Members opposite have gone into a verbal war-dance whooping with joy that we have not been able to

accomplish in two weeks a four-year programme. We

shall leave it at that, Sir. You have heard

sufficiently on this debate and the House has many

other things before it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly expresses its thanks to His Excellency the Governor for his Address delivered

on Friday, 22nd April, 1955.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EMERGENCY (PROCLAMATION)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is now my

duty to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(3)   of  section  3  of  the  Emergency  Regulations

Ordinance, 1948 (No. 17 of 1948), as amended  by  the

Emergency  Regulations  (Amendment)  Ordinance,  1948

(No.  39  of  1948),  and  the Emergency  Regulations

(Amendment)  Ordinance, 1951 (No. 9 of 1951),  adopts

the  Proclamation made by the Governor in Council  on

the  21st  day  of  April,  1955,  and  published  as

Notification No. S 113 in the Gazette Supplement  No.

30  of  21st  April, 1955, as contained in  Sessional

Paper  No.  S.L. 2 of 1955, prolonging for a  further

period  of  three months commencing the 22nd  day  of

April, 1955, the period specified in the Proclamation

of  Emergency  made on the 6th day of January,  1955,

and published as Notification No. S 16 in the Gazette

Supplement No. 3 of 14th January, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it all means this: it is my duty now to ask

this  House to confirm the Proclamation made  by  the

Governor  to  extend  the  period  of  Emergency  for

another three months; and these words have a very bad

taste  in  my  mouth. Many years ago I  used  to  act

professionally  in assisting persons  caught  in  the

wide net of these Regulations and I gained then, Sir,

a  strong distaste for arbitrary executive power  and

the abuse to which it was prone. It is not within  my

jurisdiction, as hon. Members know,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



in  the  normal course to move this motion. Internal

security  is in the portfolio of the Chief Secretary,

but  I  felt,  Sir, that to leave  it  to  the  Chief

Secretary   to  move  it  this  time  may   raise   a

misunderstanding as to the true position. He may well

have  hurled  against him opprobrium  for  continuing

these  Regulations when the decision is not, in fact,

his  alone.  It is because of the rule of  collective

Ministerial responsibility and because I want that to

be  clearly understood not only in this House but  in

the  country, that I sought this duty of  moving  the

adoption of the Proclamation and that I stand to face

the  opprobrium which such a move may bring. It would

not  be  fair  to  the Chief Secretary,  nor  to  the

Officials, to look upon this move as being  one  made

by the Chief Secretary or forced on Government by the

Official  Members  of the Council of  Ministers.  The

Council  of Ministers, Sir, as you are aware,  has  a

majority  of  six  Members of this House  as  against

three   Official  Ministers,  and  however   strongly

Official  Ministers may put their views, and  however

strongly  they may object to a line of  policy  which

the  other Ministers seek to enforce, it is now clear

that  once  a  decision is taken in the Council,  the

Officials will loyally abide by the policy  and  will

carry  it out; so that the fact that I stand here  to

move  this  motion means it has the approval  of  the

Council of Ministers. If the Council of Ministers had

decided  otherwise, you would have had all  the  hon.

Members  on  the Front Bench following  a  policy  of

repealing  the Proclamation, whatever His  Excellency

may  decide to do thereafter. I think that should  be

clearly understood. I have received to date loyal co-operation, which is a happy augury for the future and

which  is  the  basis, if I may say so,  Sir,  of  my

belief   in   the   present   workability   of   this

constitution - a  constitution  which   gives   us   an

opportunity  to seek self-government  today.  It  may

well  be  that in times to come, in matters  such  as

perhaps this one where we cannot agree, we shall find

friction,  but  I  still  believe  we  will  get  co-operation once a decision is taken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, gentlemen, it is my duty to tell

you why we of the Council of Ministers are supporting

His  Excellency in this act. For seven years a  state

of emergency has prevailed in this territory with its

concomitant Emergency Regulations. During those seven

years the Emergency Regulations have been an integral

aspect of our fabric of security. We have been but  a

fortnight  in office, Sir, working into a  new  shoe,

finding our way about, with no traditions behind  us.

By the time we had hammered out the Address which you

heard  and had to take a decision on this very  vital

matter,  we  had  an opportunity  for  but  the  most

cursory  investigation into the Emergency Regulations

and  into  the state of emergency. Every  government,

Sir,  has  to  depend  on  its  permanent  staff  for

assistance   in  understanding  various  aspects   of

official  work.  In  this particular  matter  we  are

strongly  advised by persons responsible for internal

security that there is, in fact, a continuing danger,

and   that  the  continuance  of  the  Emergency   is

essential for the security of the territory.  We  say

frankly,  Sir,  that  we have not  had  the  time  to

investigate these matters ourselves. We have had  but

a  little  time  for a cursory investigation  of  the

workings  of  the  Emergency Regulations,  and  as  a

result  you  have  seen  the  repeal  of  some  eight

Regulations  and  some  minor  others.  We  take   no

particular pride in that repeal. Let that be  clearly

understood. I do not know if it was mentioned - I think

one  gentleman  did mention it - that they  are  of  no

particular  moment.  We on the Government  Bench  are

satisfied from the history of their utilisation  that

they  are no longer necessary and, in fact, have  not

been necessary for some time, if ever they were. They

have  not been necessary for a long time, and  so  we

can   throw   them   out  of  hand  without   further

investigation, and that is what has been done, but we

do  not  take  any particular pride in  these  minor,

entirely minor, repeals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree completely with the observations of hon.

Members  opposite  that we have not  dealt  with  the

basic aspect - arrest, detention without open trial.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



I   would  like  to  assure  hon.  Members  that  the

Government  will, within the next three months,  keep

the promise that you have heard in the Address of His

Excellency, that we will exhaustively investigate not

only   whether  there  is  any  necessity   for   the

continuation of the state of Emergency, but  even  if

that  is  so,  whether there is any necessity  for  a

continuation of the Emergency Regulations as a whole.

We   shall  naturally  take  into  consideration  the

security needs of our neighbour, but our aim will  be

to  see that not only justice is done - as some Members

in  the Government believe it is done - but that it  is

done publicly for all to see. That is our aim. It  is

our  hope  that we can achieve that aim.  But  I  can

assure  hon. Members opposite that within this three-

month  period  there will be a clear  declaration  of

policy from the Government as to how much can be done

to remove this blot from our system of justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to second this

motion,  and I should, at the outset, like to confirm

what  my  hon. and learned Friend the Chief  Minister

has  just  said, and make it quite clear, beyond  any

misunderstanding  or any precipitated  jubilation  on

the  other side of the House, that I not only  second

the  motion  that  my hon. Friend has  moved,  but  I

associate   myself  fully  with  the   statement   of

Government  policy which he has given. I should  like

at  the  same time to associate myself wholeheartedly

with  the  remarks that my hon. Friend  made  on  the

working  of  our  new  system of government  in  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the subject of this motion, Sir, there

are  some  Emergency Regulations which are  generally

accepted  by  those who have thought  about  them  as

provoking   no  serious  objection  in  principle - the

Regulations governing national registration  and  the

issue  of  identity  cards, for  instance;  or  those

authorising the system of control over supplies which

would otherwise cross the Straits of Johore and reach

the  Communist  terrorists  fighting  in  the  jungle

there. Such Regulations do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



infringe  the  normal principles  of  law  and  legal

procedure, and it may be that we can enact them in  a

normal  way  and  so remove from them  the  prejudice

which  we all feel against Emergency Regulations  and

all that those two words have come to imply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my learned Friend has said, the heart of the

problem  lies  in  the  special  powers  outside  the

ordinary framework of legal procedure which have been

given  to  the Police and to the Government as  being

essential  for  the maintenance of  security  against

those  who seek to overthrow the properly constituted

government  of  this territory by  force,  by  secret

conspiracy, and by murder and by arson; and  in  this

problem  we  must, as my hon. Friend has  said,  have

regard   not  only  to  our  own  security  here   in

Singapore,  but  to the needs of our  neighbours  and

friends  in the Federation. We have heard  some  very

welcome  words in this House in the last two days  on

closer   association  with  our  neighbours  in   the

Federation.  In  considering  this  problem  of   the

Emergency  Regulations, our ties  of  friendship  may

well be put to the test. The special powers which are

most objected to are, of course, the powers of arrest

and  detention  without trial in open court,  and  we

shall,  as the House has been told, during  the  next

three   months,   closely  examine   these   security

provisions  and the necessity for them.  Meanwhile  I

should   like,   Sir,  to  give   this   House   some

appreciation  of how those special powers  have  been

used in recent months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, they have been used only against

Communists.  They are not used against  the  ordinary

criminal elements to be found in any country.  It  is

only  when  the Police have strong reason to  believe

that  a  person is working for the Malayan  Communist

Party  that they use these special powers  of  arrest

and  detention. It is quite true, of course, that  it

is  the  Police who would decide in the  first  place

whether  there is strong evidence of connection  with

the Malayan Communist Party. But there are checks  on

Police  action.  The Police can only  keep  a  person

under arrest for a few days. After that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



they  have to get what is known as a detention  order

from  me, and before I grant that order they have  to

produce evidence to me to satisfy me that the  person

to   be   detained  is  connected  with  the  Malayan

Communist  Party and that his continued detention  is

necessary  for securing the public safety.  Otherwise

he must be released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further check. A person detained has a

right  to  object to an advisory committee under  the

chairmanship of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and the

Regulations  lay  a specific duty on  the  Judge,  as

chairman,  to inform the objector of the  grounds  on

which  the  order has been made against him,  and  to

furnish  him  with such particulars  as  are  in  the

opinion  of  the Judge sufficient to  enable  him  to

present his case. Of course, these checks are not the

same   as  the  right  to  a  trial  in  open  court.

Nevertheless they are checks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far, hon. Members may wish to know, have these

special  powers  been  used  recently?  In  1954,  69

detention orders were issued. In at least 13 of these

cases  there  was evidence to show that  the  persons

detained  were  concerned  in  murder,  arson,   acid

throwing, and other crimes of violence - the crimes  by

which the Malayan Communist Party maintains its reign

of  fear.  It is because of that fear that  witnesses

will not give evidence in public court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past three months, 17 persons have been

detained;  five  of them were active  agents  of  the

Party and three were close sympathisers. Seven others

were concerned in supplying a large quantity of hand-grenades  to the Malayan Communist Party,  but  since

there  was  insufficient evidence to show that  those

people  were  themselves knowingly  working  for  the

Malayan   Communist  Party,  they  have  since   been

released.  Wherever possible, those who are  detained

are  prosecuted  in open court, and during  the  last

three  months  seven persons have been  convicted  in

court, including one case of the attempted murder  of

a  Chinese school-teacher. It is not always  possible

to  prosecute  in  court because  the  witnesses  are

afraid to give evidence in public court. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



these cases, the evidence cannot be sifted and tested

in  an open court of law. But it does not follow from

that that the evidence is not true. In fact, for what

it  is  worth to hon. Members of this House, I myself

am in no doubt that most, if not all, of the evidence

obtained  by the Police through their special  powers

of  arrest  and detention is substantially  true.  So

often it is dramatically confirmed after much patient

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. At the end of February,

the Police recovered 147 hand-grenades which had been

buried  by the Malayan Communist Party. Now this  was

the  direct result of the detention and interrogation

of  a  chain  of  students who  left  Chinese  middle

schools in 1953 and 1954. The story started with  the

arrest in January last year of the then leader of the

Malayan  Communist Party in Singapore. From  him  and

from  others  who were arrested under  the  Emergency

Regulations, the organisation of the Party was slowly

pieced  together and learnt, and many of its  members

were  identified until at last the trail led to  this

secret  dump of weapons waiting for use. This was  no

false trail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example. In August 1954, a

Chinese   high   school  student  was  detained   and

interrogated. Interrogation revealed that  he  was  a

member  of  the  branch of the Party believed  to  be

mainly  concerned with the subversion of workers  and

peasants;  and  in  this case the trail  led  to  the

recovery of two pistols and ammunition, and what  was

far, far more important, it led to the arrest of  the

three  members  of a three-man killer  squad  of  the

Malayan  Communist Party. Those three men  are  under

detention, and there is strong reason to believe that

it  was  they who were responsible for the  shootings

which  hon. Members will remember took place  in  the

first  half  of last year, including the  treacherous

shooting  down  of  two  police  constables  in   the

Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one more example. On 9th April this

year,  not  so  long ago, the Police  recovered  two

automatics, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



revolver,   ammunition  and  a  great   quantity   of

Communist documents. The information leading to  this

was  also  obtained from persons detained  under  the

Emergency Regulations; and I should like to just tell

you  something about those three weapons  which  were

recovered  on 9th April. Three weapons. One  of  them

was  a revolver which was taken from a detective  who

was  shot  and wounded in 1953. One was an  automatic

which had been stolen from a Police vehicle, and  the

third -  the  second automatic - had been snatched  from

the  body of one of those two Harbour Board policemen

shot in June last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it was suggested in an earlier debate in this

House that action under the Emergency Regulations was

against   the  interests  of  the  people;  that   it

repressed democracy. Does the House really think that

recovering  arms  and ammunition from  the  hands  of

killers  is a handicap to democracy in the  sense  of

the  word  which I hope this House means? Surely  the

investigation of Communist underground ramifications,

the  seizure  of their weapons and their  ammunition,

and the arrest of those that use those weapons in the

killer  squads,  are  a vital responsibility  of  the

Police  and  of the Government? Let us  not,  in  our

concern to ensure that justice is seen to be done  to

a person detained, forget the importance of obtaining

all  possible information so that others will not  be

shot  dead without cause and without warning, as that

young  Chinese  lad  was shot dead  on  Sunday,  17th

April,  called out from a club where, I am  told,  he

was playing a harmonica, called out and butchered  in

a  public street and in the drain. Unless the  Police

have  some special powers, these killers are unlikely

to  be  found and locked up, because no one dares  to

say  what he knows until he is sure that he  is  safe

from   retaliation.  Is  it  so  wrong   that   those

responsible for shooting down those two Harbour Board

policemen should be detained? Of course, it would  be

far  better if we could bring them to trial  in  open

court in the normal way, but if those who could  give

the evidence against them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



are too terrified to do so, would it be right that we

should  let  those men out tomorrow to shoot  someone

else  down? And if, by using the special powers given

to  them under the Emergency Regulations, the  Police

can find and arrest the two men who killed that young

man  at Cairnhill ten days ago, should we take  those

powers  away  from the Police? Do not let  us  delude

ourselves  by  thinking that that  was  any  ordinary

crime  to be solved in the ordinary way. It was  not.

How  can  we expect those who have information  which

will  be  of assistance to the Police to come forward

and  give  it  when  even the  fellow  students,  the

friends of that lad, were so terrified of this  power

of  evil that hangs over this fair city that they did

not dare to go to his funeral?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. Friend has said, the Government is deeply

concerned  that any special powers that  have  to  be

given to the Police shall be so framed that not  only

is  justice done, but that it is seen to be done. But

in  striving  for  this, we have a responsibility  to

ensure  that the rule of law does rule in  Singapore,

and  that we are not put at the mercy - if they had any

mercy - of  those  who have shown so clearly  so  often

that  anyone who dares to oppose them will be blotted

out. Is not this a problem on the principles of which

at  least  we  can all agree on both  sides  of  this

House?  We  want to see that the law of the  land  is

enforced through the law courts where every man is innocent  until he is proved guilty after a fair trial.

Yet  at  the same time we must somehow see  that  the

Malayan  Communist Party does not make a  mockery  of

our  way of life by its rule of murder and fear.  How

are  we  going to do both these things? That  is  the

problem that the Government is going to try to  solve

during  the next three months. Meanwhile we  consider

that it would be a betrayal of our responsibility  to

the  people  to vary the existing security provisions

without  careful scrutiny. So it is that we ask  this

House   to   approve   this  motion   extending   the

Proclamation  and  the  period  of  Emergency  for  a

further three months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that was a

thrilling  account of what good police and  detective

work  can unravel - plus fervent protestations  of  co-operation and collaboration between Ministers in  the

Council of Ministers. I have a sneaking feeling  that

if  that  same persuasiveness were applied  long  and

urgently  enough,  a  transformation  might  yet   be

wrought  upon the Members on the other  side  of  the

House  who were sent here by the people. But  I  have

this  one observation to make: that there is not  one

jot  of  evidence to say that this schoolboy who  was

shot under very mysterious circumstances was part  of

an  enormous political feud of terror, other than the

fact  that he was shot, and that because he was shot,

his fellow-students thought it wise to stay away from

it. That is all, this little bit of evidence, a great

deal of speculation, and we are asked to believe that

the  law is suspect, but is always administered  with

scrupulous   fairness,  impartiality;  and   absolute

justice is done in the end even though we the  people

know nothing about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could go on and then I would be accused at

the end of it of having made another election speech.

But  let me tell the hon. Members on this side of the

House  that  when  we  come here  we  make  the  same

speeches,  we say the same things that we  have  said

outside. We have no two sets of speeches, no two sets

of  values. We do not go and tell the people  outside

something  and come here and say, "Well,  after  all,

that has diddled them. We will do something different

now."  We are honest politicians, and we say what  we

feel, honestly and fearlessly. I think myself that if

the  Chief  Minister allows himself to be overwhelmed

by  the  susceptibilities of the minorities  whom  he

does  not  like to ride roughshod over  because  they

have,  after all, susceptibilities, and because  they

do  not like public meetings after seven and are very

unhappy  about it, we have got to take  note  of  the

fact  that they are very unhappy and submit to  their

susceptibilities for the time being. If that  is  the

point of view of a very brave man,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



who  came  out  and fought on a very brave  platform,

then  if  at the end of three months, again he  takes

note  of  the  susceptibilities of this minority,  we

shall  have  to revise, and I think the  public  will

also have to revise, very seriously the estimation of

the worth of the people who made those promises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary has given the

statistics  of all the people who have been  arrested

for  all the evil things that they have done. If they

have  done  these evil things, let them not  just  be

detained - let them hang for it. That is the  stand  of

the  People's Action Party. We are asked  to  believe

that  there  is  no abuse whatsoever. Of  course  the

Chief  Secretary was careful. He confined himself  to

recent  months, and no doubt their conduct in  recent

months must have been very much affected by the  fact

that  there  were these coming elections,  and  there

would  be such an occasion as this. But outside those

recent  months, I myself was engaged  in  one  matter

where several Malays were charged with murder because

one December day the Malays decided to let themselves

go  and  get their own back on society. The only  way

they knew how to get their own back on society was to

get at every white man they could get their hands  on

and  beat him up; and they killed one R.A.F. sergeant

who  never  did  anybody any wrong.  But  they  never

proved  it. The jury said they never killed him,  and

the Judge acquitted them, and they were going to come

out of the dock to express their relief when a police

officer  calmly took them by the arms and said,  "Off

you  go!",  and  I was informed that  they  had  been

detained under the Emergency Regulations. Again,  the

Chief  Secretary referred to the seven  cases,  where

they  were  all  proved in open court  to  have  been

guilty of crimes of violence or subversion. But there

was one case, I

remember, where the jury refused to convict  and  the

man left the dock to go back to prison or a place  of

detention under the Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all concerned that there should be this state of terror and fear.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



We  are keenly interested, more interested than those

who  do not have their homes here, and have somewhere

else  a  comfortable  home to retire  to,  that  this

problem must be solved. But we do not believe that it

can  be  solved  as  a military operation.  Give  the

Police  the  powers, give them the guns,  and  starve

them  out.  That will solve it! It is not a  military

problem and cannot be solved in that way. It is  part

of  a  political discontent, which has its  basis  on

social and economic conditions - (as the Chief Minister

would   have   said) - bitterness   which   finds   one

manifestation  in  this  particular  form  of  revolt

against   the   system.   Repealing   the   Emergency

Regulations  would not solve this  problem,  and  not

repealing  the Emergency Regulations would  also  not

solve  this problem. If we are ever to solve it,  let

us  have the courage to say, "We believe in democracy

and  we  are going to fight for it. We give you  this

democracy  to  fight for." If we then fail,  then  we

would  have to admit, as the French admitted in Indo-China, that nothing can succeed. It is very difficult

to  talk in terms of unemotive language of what  this

revolt   really   signifies.  It  is   part   of   an

international   revolution;  it   is   part   of   an

international conspiracy. It is a campaign of terror.

But  there are also other facets to this problem, and

a big facet is the fact that there are people who are

finally  forced  to  resort to such  a  technique  of

revolt.  They are the people who have no place  under

the sun in this society. It is curious that there are

very  few  who  come from the relatively  comfortable

English-speaking  classes, but there  are  relatively

many  who  come from the less fortunate elements  and

classes of society that the Chief Minister so vividly

described yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that if we ever hope to build an

independent democratic Malaya, we must put our  faith

in that independence and that democracy and fight for

it. You cannot fight it just as a military operation.

You  cannot squash this thing as you would  squash  a

squib  or  cracker, or a cannon, or an atom  bomb  by

deadening the fuse.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



We  are,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, dealing  with  a  human

problem,  a  problem with which  all  areas  in  this

world,  where  there  are acute economic  and  social

conditions, have somehow or the other got  themselves

entangled. In my submission we should take  one  step

forward  in  this  attempt  to  let  democracy  work,

believe in it and fight for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has said that he wanted stones to

be thrown at him and he would build houses with them.

We  hope  his Minister for Housing would not have  to

depend on such resources. But he somehow took offence

at  what  he  thought were mud-pies. It  is  so  very

difficult  when  you have not got  a  jury,  and  the

persons who say they are mud-pies are the persons  at

whom  the  stones are thrown. Whether the  criticisms

are  constructive or not quite so constructive is,  I

think,   a  matter  most  delicate  for  the   person

criticized to balance. But the People's Action Party,

and  I  think he will agree, could throw him  a  nice

big,  hefty  stone. But we will give him these  three

months.  We  hope  and pray that  he  will  have  the

courage,  not just to speak democracy,  but  to  live

democracy and give it to the people. If at the end of

the  three  months  the Chief Secretary's  persuasive

powers  have been more powerful than our very tenuous

moral  influence  on his mode of  conduct  in  public

office, then I would very much hate to see the Labour

Front go the way the Progressives have gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are not destructive. They do not want

ruination.  It is they who sent back the  Parties  on

their pledge to repeal, or to revoke, or to amend the

Emergency   Regulations.  There  must  be   a   basic

discontent  with  the way in which their  lives  have

been affected by these Regulations. It is useless  to

come  to  this  Chamber and tell a  very  interesting

story,  unravelling excellent police  investigations,

and  to hope thereby that all the opposition that has

been  brewing over seven years can be quelled. It  is

the  duty of the Chief Minister to be responsible  in

Parliament.  I  hope he will not forget  that  he  is

responsible to the people who put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



him there to do certain things they wanted him to do.

The way in which withdrawals are made is a matter  of

grave  concern.  For instance, when  he  opened  this

motion, if one could close one's eyes and forget  the

skilful  delivery  and just take  the  substance,  it

might  have  been his defeated opponent in  Cairnhill

who  talked so eloquently about the virtues  of  this

constitution. Here we were all together, five elected

men,  one  nominated, and three Government  men.  "We

were  all a team, we worked together for freedom.  In

fact,  we  worked so magnificently that we might  not

even  need a change for quite some time." But let  me

remind the Chief Minister that that was not-.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am tired of your reminder.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I will go on reminding him ad

nauseam, until he does what he has promised them.  It

is the duty of those who have been returned to fulfil

what they promised they would do.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We do not need your reminders.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that

the Chief Minister is a sensitive man and not one who

takes  criticism lightly. We hope that  he  will  not

lose his sensitivity in the many months to come,  for

there  will be, sometimes, harder things to be  said,

sometimes more friendly things to be said, but always

we  say these things because we want the right  thing

done. It is because we want the right thing done that

the People's Action Party accepts the explanation  of

the  Chief  Minister that he is unable to come  to  a

definite  conclusion about how he  is  to  set  about

repealing  these Regulations, but we would  add  this

exhortation  that the investigation  should  be  made

without bias, to give the people democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I remind the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew)  that

yesterday he said the P.A.P.'s platform was to amend,

and  not  to  repeal  or  to  remove,  the  Emergency

Regulations?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I still say that.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Why is he now criticizing this

motion,  which  is  not to repeal but  to  allow  its

extension  for  a term of three months  to  give  the

Government time for consideration? What is stated  in

the Governor's speech was the programme for the first

year.  There are still three more years to go,  three

more  years in which we are confident we could  cover

all our programme. By way of repetition, I would like

to  ask  why, if the P.A.P.'s own platform is not  to

repeal  but  to  amend,  he is  so  critical  of  the

Government's policy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

I  took the occasion yesterday afternoon to read  the

People's  Action  Party's election  platform  on  the

Emergency Regulations, and I then said and I say  now

that  if  the  Labour Front would go as  far  as  the

People's   Action  Party  and  remove  the  Emergency

Regulations  in  so  far as they  affect  arrest  and

detention  without trial in open court,  restrictions

on  freedoms of speech, assembly and publication,  we

would rest content. We are criticizing this motion in

a friendly spirit.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is the

hon.  Member permitted to make a second speech  on  a

point of explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think he has explained as much as he can explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am glad to note the silence

from  all  sides  of the House which appreciates  the

position. Of course, the P.A.P. would have to seek to

make  capital  of the occasion and keep reminding  me

that  I have to button up my bush jacket when I  come

into  the Chamber. I find that a little insolent.  We

know  what we are doing, Sir, and I find it a  little

tiring - nauseating is the term I think that the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar used - because he keeps on reminding

me  that  I should do what I have promised to  do.  I

have never failed in my promises yet, and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



will  not,  and  I would be glad to  learn  that  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar would do the same.  I  not

only speak democracy. No part of my action so far has

denied what I have spoken. And, Sir, if a promise has

to  be broken for the welfare of this country, I will

not  be  afraid to break it, because the  welfare  of

this country is greater than any promise. That is the

greatest  promise of all of us who try to serve  this

country. I will not lose, Sir, my sensitivity. I hope

the   Member   for  Tanjong  Pagar   will   gain   in

sensibility.

matters - financial matters - which will be  of  interest

to hon. Members. I would like to invite the attention

of  hon. Members firstly to Sessional Papers No. Cmd.

which  were  unanimously recommended for approval  by

the  Standing Committee on Finance of the Legislative

Council and in respect of which Special Warrants were

issued in accordance with established practice before

the dissolution of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second Paper, No. Cmd. 2 of 1955, contains a

list of applications for supplementary expenditure of

an   urgent  nature  which  were  approved   by   His

Excellency  the  Governor and  in  respect  of  which

Special  Warrants were issued during  the  period  of

interregnum   between   the   dissolution   of    the

Legislative   Council  and  the   election   of   the

Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to give a

brief  explanation to hon. Members of  the  procedure

which   we   hope   to  follow  in  connection   with

applications  for  supplementary  provision  in  this

Assembly.   Throughout  the   year   we   receive   a

considerable number of applications for supplementary

provision. These represent services which  could  not

be foreseen when the annual estimates were framed and

which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



so important and urgent that they cannot be postponed

until  the estimates for the next year are drawn  up.

These   applications  come  to  the   Treasury   from

departments and are scrutinised with great  care.  If

they are considered essential in the interests of the

public  service,  they  are put  to  the  Council  of

Ministers  and, if they are approved by the  Council,

presented  to this Assembly. We intend to  accumulate

these  applications for supplementary vote  until  we

get a sufficient number to make up a Schedule such as

has been laid on the Table of this Assembly today. We

hope,  if possible, to limit these Schedules to  four

in a financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these Schedules are prepared, they will be laid

on  the  Table  of this Assembly, and at  the  first

opportunity after that, the Financial Secretary  will

move  that  this  Assembly  approves  that  the  sums

mentioned  in  the  Schedule  be  approved  for   the

purposes  of the government. Hon. Members  will  then

have  an  opportunity  to  debate  the  motion,   and

subsequently  when  the motion is  approved,  Special

Warrants  will be issued and the amounts  covered  by

these  Warrants will be included in the Supplementary

Appropriation  Bill which will be  presented  to  the

Assembly  at the end of the financial year.  That  is

the  procedure  which  we  hope  to  follow  in  this

Assembly,  and  it  is based on sound  constitutional

practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if I may, I move, with the authority of

His Excellency the Governor,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $800,344

should be supplied to the Government under the  Heads

of  Expenditure  and  for the services  specified  in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 3 of 1955 laid on the  Table

of the Assembly this 26th day of April, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think I was fortunate enough

to   hear  you  saying  that  you  had  received  the

Governor's  recommendation. Did you? Would  you  mind

repeating it? I do not think hon. Members heard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg your pardon. I did, I

think,  say  that I had the Governor's  authority  to

move this motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paper No. Cmd. 3 of 1955 contains nine

applications for supplementary provision  and  rather

over  30 applications for revotes of provisions which

had  been  approved by the Legislature in  the  past.

Time   is  passing  on,  but  I  will  give  a  brief

explanation   of   the  various   items   for   which

application is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first item, No. 62, merely seeks the authority

of  the  Legislature for a revision downwards of  the

salary  scales attached to three appointments on  the

establishment  of the Chief Secretary.  The  salaries

attached to these appointments were upgraded  in  the

Estimates  of 1955, but on re-examination after  that

date,  the  conclusion was reached that  perhaps  the

duties  and  responsibilities of the posts  had  been

over-rated  at the salaries stated in the  Estimates.

We  consequently  seek  authority  to  downgrade  the

salaries to a level commensurate with the duties  and

responsibilities of the posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item, No. 63, seeks provision for projection equipment and

accessories  for  the  Films  Censor's  Office.  Hon.

Members  are aware that all films which are shown  to

the  public  in  Singapore must be  examined  by  the

Censor.  During  the  last 18  months  to  two  years

numerous  new  techniques  of  film  projection  have

appeared  on  the  market. The Film Censor  has  been

reluctant  to ask for provision for the new equipment

until  it  was  quite  certain  which  of  these  new

techniques were going to be permanent. It now appears

that  those techniques which use a wider screen  will

be  permanent, and consequently he seeks provision to

purchase the necessary equipment to view these films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third item, No. 64, seeks provision for the

legal  fees  in connection with the drafting  of  new

legislation for the registration of title to land  in

Singapore. Yesterday my hon. Friend the Minister  for

Local  Government (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji  Jumat)

drew attention to the fact that this Government hoped

to introduce new legislation for registration of land

titles  based  on the Torrens system.  Attempts  have

been  made in the past to draft legislation  on  this

basis without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



success. Recently, however, we have been fortunate in

being  able  to  obtain the services of  perhaps  the

leading authority in Australia on the Torrens  system

of  land  tenure. He and his colleagues  in  Chambers

have  drafted  a Bill which is now in  Singapore  and

this  fee  is  required  to remunerate  him  for  his

services. I should say that the fee includes the cost

of  his  appearing before any Select Committee  which

may  be set up by this Assembly to consider the Bill,

and,  if  necessary,  before  the  Bar  Committee  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth item, No. 65, seeks provision for the

upkeep  of  the  Speaker's  house  and  grounds.  Mr

Speaker's residence is one of the official residences

of  Government, and it is necessary that it  and  its

grounds  be upkept appropriately. Most unfortunately

this  provision  was omitted from the Estimates  when

they were drafted in 1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth item, No. 66, seeks provision for the

salaries   of   Ministers-the  Chief   Minister   and

Ministers - for  the remainder of this year.  You  will

see  from  the Schedule that it is proposed that  the

Chief  Minister should be paid $3,500  a  month,  and

that the Ministers should be paid $2,500 a month, and

the  Assistant Minister $1,500 a month. In  addition,

they  will, of course, draw the stipends paid to them

as  Members  of  this  Assembly. These  salaries  and

stipends  have been considered with very great  care,

and  I  feel  myself  that  they  are  no  more  than

adequate,  having regard to the nature of the  duties

which  the  Ministers have to discharge  and  to  the

great responsibilities which they have to bear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth item, No. 67, seeks provision for

salaries, wages and equipment of the Flood Prevention

Investigation  Unit. Hon. Members  will  recall  that

after the disastrous floods in December of last  year

it  was  decided to recruit the services of an expert

to  examine the whole question of floods in Singapore

Island   and  to  make  recommendations   for   their

prevention,  or at least their alleviation.  We  were

fortunate   to   get  the  services  of   the   Chief

Construction Engineer of the Drainage and  Irrigation

Department in the Federation on secondment, who is an

expert



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



in these matters. He has now been in Singapore for  a

little over a month and has made a preliminary review

of  the  situation,  and this  provision  covers  his

requirements  for  staff  and  equipment  which  will

enable  him to complete the investigation as soon  as

possible.  I think all hon. Members will  agree  that

that is required as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item No. 68 seeks provision for the purchase of high

frequency  mobile  wireless  sets  for  the  use   of

security  forces  in Singapore. The present  wireless

sets  used by the Military security forces are  field

equipment  which  are in certain respects  unsuitable

for  use  in built-up areas, certainly built-up  city

areas.  Domestic  appliances, neon  lights,  trolley-buses  and  industrial plant cause  such  disturbance

that  these  sets  are unsuitable,  and  enquiry  has

brought  to  light the fact that it is unlikely  that

these  forces will be issued with equipment  suitable

for  use in built-up areas for some time to come. The

Army   have  therefore  asked  us  to  purchase   the

equipment on their behalf and lend it to them for use

in  Singapore. We propose to do this and it has  been

agreed  that  the  Army will pay a satisfactory  rent

which  will  be sufficient to amortize the  equipment

purchased well within its useful life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item No. 69 seeks provision for the purchase of a

teleprinter  switchboard at Police Headquarters.  The

existing    teleprinter   switchboard    at    Police

Headquarters contains provision for 30 lines; 24  are

at  present used, the other six will be used  in  the

very near future. Having regard to the development of

police communications, it is quite clear now that  an

extension  will  be required for the  switchboard.  A

switchboard  takes a year to build. It  is  desirable

that it should be ordered now, and we feel that if  a

switchboard   containing  30  additional   lines   is

ordered,   it   will  be  sufficient  for   all   new

requirements of the police for some time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last item, No. 70, seeks provision for the

purchase  of very high frequency radio equipment  for

Police  Headquarters. This provides for  five  Duplex

transmitting-receiving sets  which  are  regarded  as

essential for use in the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



Combined  Police  Operation Room for  establishing  a

network of emergency Police Communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining items in the Schedule refer to

applications  for revotes of expenditure  which  have

already   been   approved  in  past  years   by   the

Legislature,  which have remained unspent  either  in

whole  or  in  part, and which are now  required  for

expenditure. These have all been examined with  great

care  in  the  Treasury, and  the  authority  of  the

Legislature is now required for their revote. As they

have   all  been  considered  in  the  past  by   the

Legislature,  I  will not take up the  time  of  hon.

Members  to  give  a  detailed  explanation  of  each

item - there are 34 - but I shall be happy to answer  any

questions which Members care to put.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on page 5 of the Schedule, you will find a

summary  of  the  sums involved in  applications  for

provision  which  have been approved,  or  for  which

approval  is now sought, since the beginning  of  the

year.   You   will   see   that   applications    for

supplementary vote in the Ordinary Estimates  to-date

total  $3.8 million, and in the Development Estimates

close on $1 million. Hon. Members will be anxious  to

have  an  assurance that funds will be available  for

this expenditure, and I can give that assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I rise to second.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I want to speak on item No.

66 - Salaries of the Ministers. During the recess -  and

it was wisely suggested by the Chief Minister that we

ought  to have a recess - we discussed this item.  This

afternoon  I had a little jibe at the Chief  Minister

about  his  coolie and labourer, income for  whom  he

should  think  about when he thinks of this  princely

salary   that   he  might  be  getting.   But   after

consideration during the recess, we find that he  has

made  a  considerable  sacrifice  in  his  income  by

accepting  this salary. Even the P.A.P. leader  (Mr

Lee  Kuan  Yew) went so far as to say that  he  would

like to increase - [Interruption.] - and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



the Chief Minister said, "I am quite satisfied."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, further discussion arose. I might tell the

House  that  only  two days ago we  had  an  informal

meeting  of  the  would-be  Trade  Advisory  Council,

representing   Chambers   of   Commerce   and   other

interested  business, and they were of the  unanimous

opinion  that  the  Minister  for  Commerce  and  the

Assistant Minister to him have very responsible  jobs

and  that  they should not be engaged in any  private

vocation.  That  was the unanimous decision.  In  the

House  after enquiry I find from the Government  side

that  there  are  no  private  interests  or  private

vocations   for   the   Assistant   Minister.    Now,

considering this, the Assistant Minister's salary  is

rather  low. It is a full-time job, Sir, and I  would

like  to say, with the concurrence of my friends over

here  on my side, that it should be raised to $2,000.

I do not know whether I could move an amendment. I do

not know, but that is my expression of opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am advised that we can delete this $1,500 and

make  it  $2,000.  I  would  like  to  be  guided  on

procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr R. Jumabhoy, unless you have the

recommendation  or  consent of  the  Governor,  I  am

afraid  you  will not be able to move any  motion  on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Then, Sir, may I suggest that this

suggestion of mine be placed with His Excellency  the Governor?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  on a point of clarification on Sessional  Paper

No.  Command  3 on one of the items. The  first  item

which  I would like to deal with is item No. 64 which

read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Subhead-Legal fees in connection with the

drafting  of new legislation for the registration  of

title to land in Singapore - $20,000."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although an explanation has been given by the Hon.

the   Financial  Secretary,  I  would  like  him   to

elaborate on how this figure is arrived at. I  really

cannot  understand  that it is so expensive  to  seek

legal opinion for the drafting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



of  new  legislation in respect  of  title  deeds  in

Singapore. If the Hon. the Financial Secretary  could

enlighten  us on the question of how this  figure  is

arrived at, I will be quite pleased to accept it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think, hon. Members, it would be

convenient if we disposed of each item that is raised

by   any  hon.  Member  so  that  we  will  not  have

confusion. This, of course, will not debar the Member

for  Queenstown from asking questions  on  any  other

Head. We will then deal with item No. 64.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> May I, first of all, tell the hon. Mr R.

Jumabhoy   that  we  will  note  his  suggestion   in

connection with the salary of the Assistant  Minister

for Commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question which has been raised on

item No. 64, I appreciate that in all probability the

sum  of  $20,000  appears,  prima  facie,  to  be   a

considerable sum. On the other hand, it must be borne

in  mind  that the gentleman who has assisted  us  in

this matter is the leading authority in Australia  on

the   Torrens   system  of  land  tenure   and   land

registration.  We have made enquiries in  Sydney  and

are  given to understand that this fee of $20,000  is

not  out of the way, having regard to fees which  are

paid  to  leading  counsel  at  the  Australian  Bar.

Furthermore, I would point out that this fee  is  not

paid  for the services of one man alone. It  is  paid

not only to him but to the assistants in his Chambers

who  helped him to draft the Bill. Also I would point

out  that  this  Bill  is  not  a  simple  matter  of

drafting.  It  is a piece of complicated  legislation

which endeavours to incorporate the best features  of

the  Torrens system of land registration in Australia

and  New Zealand and in the Federation of Malaya, and

at  the  same time to introduce the best features  of

land  registration  in  the United  Kingdom,  and  to

modify  them  all  in accordance with  the  needs  of

Singapore.  I myself raised this question  about  the

suitability of a fee, and I can say, after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



examination,  in my capacity as Financial  Secretary,

that I am satisfied that the fee is suitable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

satisfied with the explanation given by the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary, but I think it  would  be  more

appropriate,  since  no  definite  figure  could   be

arrived  at,  that a token vote be  included  in  the

Estimates.  However,  since an explanation  has  been

given and it is included in the Estimates, I am happy

to accept that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder, Mr Speaker, Sir, if you would allow me to proceed on the next item before the House -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will any other hon. Member wish to

speak  on  that  item so that we can dispose  of  it?

Carry on, Mr Lee Choon Eng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my next item

refers  to  revotes, which the old Council passed  as

item  No.  90. It refers to renewal of locks  in  the

local prison which costs $97,438. It really surprises

me, Sir, that the renewal of locks would cost such  a

heavy  amount  as this. I wonder if those  locks  are

made  of gold or so forth, and, if not, I would  like

an  explanation from the Hon. the Financial Secretary

telling  us  why it costs so much for the renewal  of

locks.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Item No. 90 is now before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this item refers to

renewal  of  locks  in the Outram  Road  Prison.  The

existing locks were put into the prison, or put  into

the  doors of the cells in the prison, and  to  other

doors   in  the  prison  80  years  ago.  They   were

considerably  tampered with during the  time  of  the

Japanese   occupation,  and  at   the   moment   they

constitute  a security risk. Not only is it  possible

for  prisoners to pick the locks and get out.  It  is

also   on   some   occasions   impossible   for   the

Superintendent to get the prisoners out of the cells.

I  may  say  in  this connection that we  employed  a

representative of the famous firm of Chubb  who  came

out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



from  the United Kingdom, made an examination of  the

locks  in the Outram Road jail, and on his advice  we

placed  an  order for them. Again, I may say  that  I

regard the sum as a reasonable figure for the service

being performed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I

should  have risen earlier had I known the  procedure

that  would be adopted, because I would like to refer

to   item   No.  66  (Salaries  of  the  Council   of

Ministers).  Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the  Hon. the

Chief Minister will be delighted this evening to know

that the People's Action Party takes a very high view

of  his attitude, his sense of self-sacrifice, and we

say,  without any condescension whatsoever, that  the

figures  that  have  been submitted  are  modest  and

moderate.  I  am  made to understand that  the  other

Ministers  are  getting  less than  the  professional

administrators who are Ministers in this House. That,

in  my opinion, is not a proper state of affairs, for

it  must  never  be forgotten that  whilst  they  are

performing the same duties and undertaking  the  same

responsibilities, they do not, in  the  first  place,

have the same perquisites of office like a Government

house,  Government  quarters at a sub-economic  rent;

and  what  is more important is that they, more  than

the professional administrators, face the hazards  of

a  political  life. In my opinion, this is  a  useful

stage to consider what they ought to be getting,  not

now,  but  for many years to come, because  once  the

point is fixed, it would be an invidious task for any

succeeding government to try in any way to change it.

Of  course,  there could be a lot of  mock  hypocrisy

about  this - we have come to serve the people.  We  do

not want money, and as proof of the fact that we want

to  serve  the people, we are prepared to  take  very

little  for  it.  But I think we  ought  to  be  more

realistic about it and face the facts. By the time  a

man is doing that job, by the time that confidence is

reposed  in  him by the public and by the Party  that

has a majority in this House, he ought to be given an

emolument adequate to his position. And a situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



where a Minister gets somewhat less all-round than  a

Permanent  Secretary who is supposed to be  assisting

him in the functions of his Ministry is, I think, not

a healthy one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to make full amends. Members of the

Bar  will  realise that. Two Ministers have given  up

their  practices and I think it is impossible for  us

to  compensate  them for what they  were  getting  in

private  practice.  To  that  extent  there  is   the

inevitable sacrifice. We must face the fact  that  if

it  is  allowed  to remain as it is,  any  succeeding

government - be  it  Labour, Progressive,  Democrat  or

even  P.A.P. - will find it extremely uncomfortable  to

have  to go back to the people and say, "Well,  after

all,  the  Labour Front did it for you very  cheaply,

but  they  did  it very badly because they  were  not

properly paid."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one should remember that there is not very

much  really  involved in it except the  question  of

prestige  and  principle, because  the  total  amount

involved  to the country is very little. One  bridge-building  mismanaged which collapses  and  costs  the

country on rebuilding $500,000 would pay for all  the

Ministers  for  the next two to three  years.  In  my

opinion, there should be a suggestion taken  back  to

His    Excellency   the   Governor,   after    proper

consideration by the Council of Ministers, that  this

list  be  revised.  We appreciate the  restraint.  We

appreciate also the hesitation to open the Council of

Ministers to attack, but I think hon. Members on  the

other  side have under-estimated the generosity,  not

just  financially, but the generosity in spirit  with

which we approached this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I just want to make my suggestion quite

clear. Hon. Members, of course, are not debarred from

reopening  any  item which we have  passed.  That  is

quite  clear.  I  only suggested that  procedure  for

convenience, and the only thing Members must remember

is  that  they can speak only once to any  one  item.

That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed

indebted  to  the  Member  for  Telok  Ayer  (Mr  R. Jumabhoy)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



and  the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew),

but  the latter could not avoid the jibe that perhaps

there  was  a little mock hypocrisy on our part.  The

Hon. the Financial Secretary in mentioning this item

said  he thought that it was no more than appropriate

considering  the work involved, and  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  compared  it  with  what  was   being

received  by Permanent Secretaries. I think the  true

approach should be: What is adequate for a reasonably

spacious  way of life for a person in that particular

position? And no more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself feel that in this country we have learnt to

live  on too extravagant a scale, and that, in  fact,

$3,500  to  the Chief Minister is pretty high.  I  am

conscious that I am not married, Sir, and I  have  to

look  forward  to the possibilities of  change  where

others may be in a more difficult position. $3,500 is

a  great deal of money. However much more I may  have

earned in the past is not the point. But the question

is:  Is  it adequate for a decent way of life in  the

position  of  the Chief Minister in this  country?  I

think  the answer, Sir, from me, is yes, and  I  hope

for my successors. It is adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not lack courage. I do not wish to seem

boastful. We do not lack courage in taking unpleasant

steps,  and it was not because we feared the lack  of

generosity  of  hon. Members in this  House  that  we

placed  our salaries at a modest scale. It is because

we  would  like,  Sir, to set a new standard,  a  new

outlook, as to what is proper, and from that point of

view, Sir, we have given ourselves a little too much.

And  hon. Members will remember this: that apart from

the salaries we are getting as Ministers, we are also

receiving  emoluments  of $500  a  month  by  way  of

allowances to all hon. Members here; we as Members of

the   Assembly  are  receiving  $500;  the  Assistant

Minister receiving $1,500 makes it $2,000; $2,500 for

the  Minister plus $500 makes it $3,000;  $3,500  for

the Chief Minister is $4,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it has been suggested, we will certainly not

only    note,   but   bring   forward   for   further

consideration   to  the  Council  of  Ministers   the

suggestion  made by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar.  I

think  we  ought to clarify this point  of  it:  that

Permanent Secretaries do not receive more, if we take

into consideration the additional $500 we receive  as

Members of the House. It is true we serve full  time,

and  it  is true that there are no trade union  hours

for  Ministers.  The way to look  at  it  is:  Is  it

adequate  for a reasonably spacious way of life?  And

though  there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction,

admittedly, I think that this House should  be  chary

of  encouraging  extravagance in public  expenditure,

and I hope that this House will set a new standard in

respect of public expenditure and public emoluments.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hart, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I do not think there is anything more I

can add, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $800,344

should be supplied to the Government under the  Heads

of  Expenditure  and  for the services  specified  in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 3 of 1955 laid on the  Table

of the Assembly this 26th day of April, 1955.

<div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Amendment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning I

moved  that at the termination of business we  should

adjourn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



to  the  24th  day of May. I now find that  Han  Raya

Puasa  is  on the 23rd day of May. However, depending

on  the sighting of the moon, the public holiday  and

Han  Raya Puasa may well fall on the 24th. I  wonder,

Sir, if I might seek your indulgence and that of  the

Members of the House under the provisions of Standing

Order 23 to move an amendment to that motion, so that

"24th" will read "Wednesday, the 25th of May". I  beg

your indulgence, Sir, in that matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consent of the Speaker and of the House having been indicated -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May it please you, Sir, I formally move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House do now stand adjourned to Wednesday, the 25th day of May, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would rather, Mr Chief Minister, you

first amend your original motion for adjournment.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May it please you, Sir, I now

formally move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the motion for adjournment be amended to read

"25th day of May, 1955", substituted for "24th day of May".



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I rise to second.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House do now stand adjourned to Wednesday,

the 25th day of May, 1955.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at 6.25 p.m. to</div>
